    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-04a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120400060#WRA00900"><p>I refer the Deputy to my response to Question number 9 of today in relation to fare increases.  As I stated in my earlier reply, the National Transport Authority (NTA) is responsible for determining fares in respect of publicly funded bus and rail services and I have no role in the setting of public transport fares. However, I am aware that the changes in bus and rail fares recently announced will cause hardship for many commuters in this city and this country. I am also aware how they may lead to some people questioning the value of public transport vis-&agrave;-vis the cost of running a car.     </p><p>  The maintenance of subsidy funding for public transport for 2015 at present levels has enabled the NTA to moderate the fares&rsquo; increases necessary so that the operators can maintain as far as possible the current level of services and can also respond to sectors where demand is growing and capacity needs to be increased. It is welcome to note that, following some years of declining passenger numbers, growth in passenger numbers across all the public transport operators has returned with an average 3.6% increase to September this year. I note that the NTA has stated that it takes into consideration a number of factors in the fares determination process but primarily the objective is to find a greater match between the costs of operating public transport to the revenues accruing from it, while also protecting public transport services themselves. </p><p>  The NTA is also engaged in the development and deployment of technologies to make it easier to use public transport.  Public transport service quality is also an important factor that influences passenger demand and the NTA has delivered a number of significant cross-operator initiatives such as real time information at bus stops, on Apps and online, the National Journey Planner, the Leap Card, investment in the bus fleet and on-board Wi-Fi, improved public transport maps and the reconfiguration of regional city bus services that to date includes Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</p></reply>

A major expansion of the<i>dublinbikes</i>scheme has recently been completed in Dublin City with approximately &euro;5.2 million provided in funding by my Department and administered by the National Transport Authority through Dublin City Council. This brought expansion of the scheme to Dublin 8 including Kilmainham and Heuston Station, and including Barrow street and South Dock Road in Dublin 4. I am not aware of any delay in the recent expansion of the scheme.<br/><br/>Further to this, the Deputy will be aware of Dublin City Council's plans to further extend this scheme which are outlined in the Council's &quot;Dublinbikes Strategic Planning Framework 2011 - 2016&quot; document which was published in 2011. <br/><br/>Dublin City Council is continuing to finalise the roll-out of the current programme of expansion and have therefore not sought any additional funding from the National Transport Authority beyond the work currently being undertaken. </p></reply>

However, it was clear that the funding proposed by the employers is the maximum that can be achieved.  Therefore, having considered the Trustee&rsquo;s request and reflected on all of the issues relating to the IASS, including the significant deficit of &euro;750m, I signed the Commencement Order on 17 November 2014.  </p><p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that this will cause for many members but the risks that will arise for all members, the companies and the wider economy in the event of failure of this solution are even greater and this is the reason that I commenced these provisions.  I believe that the funding proposal put forward by the Trustee offers the best possible outcome for all members given the acute difficulties and unsustainable circumstances of this fund. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-04a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120400060#WRA01500"><p>DART Underground is now being reviewed and assessed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) in conjunction with other large public transport projects for the Dublin area. The 2010 business case for DART Underground is currently being updated and will be based on the latest data on population, transport demand, construction costs etc.   The NTA have advised me that the DART Underground report and the outcome from the Fingal/North Dublin Transport Study and the preliminary Business Case for the BRT to Swords will be available by mid 2015.  </p><p>  Following receipt and assessment of the reports  I will then consider  the options and priorities for  addressing  key public transport deficits in the GDA having regard  to the  costs and benefits and affordability of each project as well as funding sources and options including private funds, EIB loans and EU grants. </p><p>  Significant additional Exchequer resources will be required to advance any new major project irrespective of the availability of private or EU funds. With existing funding levels the key priority is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards. If additional funds become available, there will be many competing projects from all transport modes in all regions.  </p><p>  I will prioritise any additional funds for projects for which there is a clear need, which are affordable, have a sound business case and add value to existing infrastructure. I would expect that there will be public transport projects in the Dublin region which will meet these criteria if funds are available. </p><p>  The Railway Order for DART Underground is valid until 2024 but a High Court Judgement in February 2014 determined that the period for serving Notices to Treat for the purpose of compulsory purchase of property under the Order should be 18 months from the date of the Judgement, rather than the 7 years set out in the Railway Order.  As a consequence, a decision on whether to proceed with DART Underground under the current Railway Order must be made by September 2015 if the CPO conditions applicable to the project are to be met. </p></reply>

High fuel and operating costs leaves the remaining months unsustainable.  Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company issued a press release on 20th November 2014 stating that it had been informed by Stena Line that it will not operate its Holyhead Dun Laoghaire service over the 2014 Christmas period.  Passengers and freight customers, however, can still avail of the company's route between Dublin Port and Holyhead. This route has 4 sailings a day in each direction between these ports and  the company operates a year round schedule. </p><p>  The port is actively engaged in discussions with Stena Line in respect of a seasonal service from 2015.  </p><p>  The port company is also focused on building the volume of cruise calls for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, and beyond. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the proposed transfer of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company to Local Authority control requires primary legislation. In September this year the Joint Oireachtas Committee considered the draft General Scheme in relation to the Bill and I have since responded to the Committee on its recommendations. The Bill is now with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for legal drafting. I expect a Bill will be ready for publication in Q1 2015. </p><p>  As with all other relevant port companies, I requested D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company establish a Steering Group comprised of Company and Council representatives to consider and oversee the transition to the new governance structures. Such a group has now been established. An important first step will be a full due diligence process for which my Department has made some funding available. I understand terms of reference for such a process are currently being finalised.</p><p>  My officials will continue to liaise with the Company and the Council throughout the process.</p></reply>

Negotiated permissive access, from the perspective of cost and public ownership, continues to have value but, for projects of national scale, consideration must be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.  The process of obtaining permissive access is resource intensive and I would have my doubts that such a process could be deployed on projects of national scale where agreement would need to be secured with hundreds or more landowners.  Greater investment is now being provided for greenways and it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State. Of course, as already stated, it will be a matter for all developers of cycling infrastructure to consider access to land on a case by case basis and to take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process.  </p><p>  In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land, I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial agreements or, if required, CPO. However, I certainly recommend that all other options are considered before land purchase is decided upon. </p><p>  The key consideration should always be to select an approach that will maximise the future use of the amenity concerned.</p></reply>

Child benefit is a universal payment that assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. It is paid to more than 613,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014. <br/><br/>Child benefit is paid monthly in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and in respect of children over 16 years of age up to their 18th birthday who are in full time education, on certain training schemes or have a disability. The current age limit was set under Budget 2009 when the upper age limit that applied then was reduced from 19 years to 18 years with effect from 2010. Child benefit has never been paid to those over 19 years of age. <br/><br/>For families on low incomes there are a number of provisions to social welfare schemes which support children in third level education until the age of 22.  These include:<br/><br/>- qualified child increases (QCIs) with primary social welfare payments<br/><br/>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children.<br/><br/>Therefore, I have no plans to make any changes to the age threshold for child benefit.  <br/><br/>Budget 2015 increased child benefit by &euro;5, from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per month, which will benefit over 611,000 households with children. In addition, the new back to work family dividend for long-term unemployed jobseekers with children and lone parents who return to work, will provide &euro;29.80 per child in the first year and half that figure in the second year.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 71,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<br/><br/>The Department is finalising a review of the maximum rent limits under the rent supplement scheme.  I am concerned that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients. Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. I plan to keep this matter under close review.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience and make every effort to ensure that accommodation needs are met including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers on a case by case basis, as necessary.  A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power, including those operating in Kildare, to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated earlier this year. The Department is currently examining the procedures in place throughout the country to ensure that the necessary supports continue to be provided.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-04a.131.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120400063#WRD01500"><p>The Government recognises that small businesses, including those in the hospitality sector, play a central role in the sustainable recovery of the Irish economy. To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. <br/><br/>2013, the year of The Gathering, was the best year for inbound tourism since 2008. Tourism delivers income and jobs in every town and city and to every corner of our country. The abolition of the air travel tax last year will result in over one million extra passengers through additional capacity on many existing routes, as well as the introduction of new services. The reduced 9% rate of VAT on tourism related activities has been a great success and there are now an extra twenty three thousand employed in the sector since mid-2011. In addition, as I announced in the Budget 2015 speech, I increased the amount of finance that can be raised by a company under the Employment and Investment Incentive to&euro;5 million annually subject to a lifetime maximum of &euro;15 million and I also increased the required holding period for shares from 3 to 4 years. With specific regard to the hospitality sector, I extended the inclusion of hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation in the scheme by a further 3 years.<br/><br/>Some recent joint banking/industry research has revealed that a majority of Irish hoteliers are optimistic about the medium term outlook for the sector with (67%) saying that the tourism sector will improve within the next three years. A total of 71% believe the financial performance of their own properties will improve within the same time-frame. The research also revealed that 54% of hotels saw turnover increase in 2012, with 26% saying it decreased. <br/><br/>Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016 and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector. <br/><br/>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses, and the SME State Bodies Group, which includes representation from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  <br/><br/>Some of the main policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:<br/><br/>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at <i></i>.<br/><br/>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.  The SBCI, from available funding of some &euro;800 million initially, will provide a more extensive range of financing than is currently offered in Ireland. A full roll-out will occur from January 2015 with traditional bank lenders and importantly, new credit providers from beyond the traditional bank sector being involved which means SMEs will benefit from greater choice as well as more funding.  More information on the SBCI can be found on <i>.</i><br/><br/>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included. <br/><br/>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund. This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness. <br/><br/>- The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer John Trethowan and his team have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at <i></i><br/><br/>The Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context the forthcoming Action Plan for Jobs 2015 will include a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.  </p></reply>

This requires it to take an objective view of both the potential rewards and potential risks attaching to any proposal and be guided by its overall objective which is to achieve the best financial return for taxpayers.  NAMA must adopt a rigorous and prudent but commercial approach in relation to the expenditure of public funds and it seeks to ensure that taxpayers are not exposed to unwarranted risks. In making its decisions, NAMA has significant internal financial and project appraisal expertise and it has access, where required, to external advice and validation.</p><p>  All NAMA decisions are clearly communicated to debtors.  All NAMA decisions are documented and signed off by the appropriate NAMA Board-approved delegated authority and are subject to independent review by internal and external auditors.  In addition, the NAMA Chairman and CEO have publicly stated on a number of occasions that any debtor with a concern or complaint in relation to their dealings with NAMA should directly contact them.  All such queries and complaints are fully investigated by the Chairman and CEO.  Ultimately, it is also the case that all debtors have recourse to the courts should they feel that such recourse is required.</p></reply>

The cost to the exchequer for the relief in 2013 is estimated to be &euro;76m based on investors spending &euro;185m and claiming relief at 41%.  It is being replaced by a Corporation Tax credit with relief at 32%.  Therefore, if a similar expenditure of &euro;185m was incurred there would be a saving to the exchequer of &euro;17m.  The budget estimate (2013) was for a saving of &euro;20m in 2016.<br/><br/>Section 825BRepayment of tax where earnings are not remitted was phased out with effect from tax year 2012 with end year of 2015.  The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP - section 825C) was introduced from tax year 2012.<br/><br/>Section 848AThe scheme of tax relief for donations made to approved bodies (i.e. charities etc.) was amended in a number of respects with effect from 1 January 2013. One of the changes was that relief for donations made by self-assessed taxpayers, previously obtained by way of a deduction from taxable income, was aligned with that for PAYE-only taxpayers such that the relief is now given on a &quot;grossed-up&quot; basis at the rate of 31% to the approved body (and not to the donor).  This and the other changes made were on a cost neutral basis. </p></reply>

No. 147 of 2013) as having &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot;. These Regulations describe the methodology that must be used when a property is being assessed for pyrite damage.</p><p>  Unless and until the LPT legislation is changed, Revenue has an obligation to act in accordance with section 10A of the LPT legislation which requires that an LPT exemption can only apply where the residential property has been assessed and a certificate confirming &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; has been issued.</p><p>  I expect to make a decision as regards alternatives shortly, that will be consistent with the original objectives of the legislation, and the report of the Pyrite Panel, and I will communicate my decision to the Deputy immediately it is made. </p><p>  It is important that any changes that may be made do not go beyond the objectives of providing a temporary exemption for homes with &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; only. As I have advised on many occasions in the past, a liability to LPT should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate of the tax to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.</p></reply>

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p><p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate. To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>  - be without one or both legs;</p><p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;43.5 million to the Exchequer in 2013. This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  In terms of the numbers of beneficiaries of the Scheme in 2013, 4,355 citizens availed of the Vehicle Registration Tax and/or VAT relief, and 11,436 availed of the repayment of excise on fuel element of the Scheme. </p><p>  The Department of Finance conducted a review of Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme in 1993, which informed the drafting and enactment of the 1994 Regulations. As part of the review, the position of single hand amputees was considered given extensive representations made seeking the inclusion of persons without the use of one arm or hand within the qualifying medical criteria. The review noted that such a disability did not present as serious a challenge to mobility as the extant qualifying criteria, and on that basis, and in the context of limited resources, priority should be given to those citizens with the greatest challenge to their mobility.</p><p>  Unfortunately, the current context is still one of constrained resources. I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. However, in the still challenging fiscal environment and given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

In addition to providing certainty, it also eases the administration burden on the homeowner by not having to revalue their houses each year.</p><p>  The regular revaluation periods ensure that the property register is maintained with accurate and up to date information to assist in evaluating the operation of LPT, as well as bringing newly built properties within the scope of LPT.   The Deputies may be aware that under the LPT legislation, where a property is not a &quot;relevant residential property&quot; on a valuation date (i.e. not liable to LPT), with certain exceptions, that property will not be a relevant residential property until the next valuation date.  In the interests of equity to compliant LPT payers it is important to have regular valuation dates so that newly built properties are brought into the LPT net.  It also provides certainty to those homeowners as to when they will become liable to LPT. </p><p>  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid from 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2016, and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, including repairs or improvements made, during this period.  I also committed not to amend the central national rate of LPT for the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  While I am very conscious of the concerns of homeowners over increasing property prices and the effects this will have on their LPT liabilities, particularly in urban areas, the next valuation date is not until 1 November 2016.  In advance of that date, in conjunction with my officials, I will be examining the LPT and impacts on LPT liabilities due to increasing property prices.</p></reply>

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p><p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions: </p><p> - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p> - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p> - be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p> - be without one or both legs;</p><p> - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p> - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>  If a citizen does not meet the eligibility criteria above, they will not qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, and subsequently cannot become members for the Scheme.</p><p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;43.5 million to the Exchequer in 2013.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  In terms of the numbers of beneficiaries of the Scheme in 2013, 4,355 citizens availed of the Vehicle Registration Tax and/or VAT relief, and 11,436 availed of the repayment of excise on fuel element of the Scheme. </p><p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  I frequently receive correspondence from applicants who do not meet the qualifying criteria but feel that they could benefit from the Scheme.  While the I sympathise with those who do not qualify for Scheme, I cannot, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, expand it further within the current context of constrained resources.</p></reply>

Staff who were already on career break at the time the revised scheme was introduced were permitted to remain on career break under the terms of the original circular (18/1998).</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">Circular 4/2013 revoked the specific instructions which are referred to in the details supplied with the Deputy question as follows:</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">- Circular 18/1998</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">- Letter to Personnel Officers dated 3/3/2008 - Special leave without pay for career breaks in: Amendments to Circular 18/98 in relation to Eligibility and Duration and Purpose.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">- Letter to Personnel Officers dated 18/3/2009 - Special leave without pay for career breaks and resumption of duty. This sets out provisions relating to resumption of duty, reassignment to another Department and persons who fail to indicate their intention to return to duty.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">The details provided by the Deputy refer to Paragraph 23 of Circular 18/1998 and the return to work of a staff member following a career break. This paragraph states that </font><i><font color="#181818">where an officer indicates that s/he wishes to resume duty, s/he will be assigned to the next appropriate vacancy to be filled following the expiry of the career break, with a guarantee of re-employment in a relevant grade (not necessarily in his/her existing Department) within twelve months of the expiry of the career break.</font></i><br/><br/><font color="#181818">Civil service organisations therefore have, under the new and the previous scheme, up to twelve months after the expiry of the career break to make an offer of employment. That offer is subject to there being an appropriate vacancy in the employing organisation. Where a civil service organisation considers that it is unlikely that a vacancy will arise for an individual returning from career break, the onus is on the organisation to ensure the person is put on the PAS redeployment panel and inform the individual of this and the fact that s/he will be circulated with redeployment vacancies. </font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">The detail of this process is set out in th</font>e &quot;&quot;,(<font color="#181818">revised in October 2014) and agreed with the staff unions, which sets out the background and the process for staff returning from career break who are put on the redeployment panel. </font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">If it is not possible to make a reasonable offer within the 12 month period after the expiry of the career break, the possibility of facilitating the civil servant on a supernumerary basis must be explored. Where the civil servant refuses a reasonable offer of work, the Department is under no further obligation to provide employment and can deem a refusal to be a resignation.</font><br/><br/><font color="#181818">  The administration of the Career Break Scheme is a matter for each individual Department/Office.

If we are to do this successfully, it is important that the economic potential of each region is maximised and that each region builds on its particular strengths and assets to provide an environment that stimulates entrepreneurship and attracts both indigenous and foreign investment.  While employment has increased nationally by approximately 80,000 since the start of the Action Plan process in 2012, not all regions are yet fully experiencing the benefits of economic recovery.  The pace of progress in the regions therefore needs to be accelerated through targeted supports for enterprise and job creation.   </p><p>  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of commitments to support competitive regions, including, within my own Department, developing a framework for Regional Enterprise Strategies.  It is my intention that this framework will be applied to produce action-oriented plans to support enterprise growth and jobs in the regions, commencing with the Midlands.  Consultation with regional stakeholders from both the private and public sector will underpin the Enterprise Strategies.  </p><p>  Over the past number of months, officials from Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and my Department have been involved in a series of engagements with stakeholder groups in the Midlands region, which included representatives from the enterprise sector, skills and education providers, and public bodies operating in the region. </p><p>  The consultation process will continue with a Midlands Regional Enterprise Forum on the 19th  December in Athlone, which will bring all the main stakeholder groups together to discuss the strengths and opportunities that can be built upon to support enterprise and jobs growth in the region.  The consultation process will inform the Regional Enterprise Strategy for the Midlands which I aim to publish early in the New Year.</p></reply>

In response to the reservations expressed by farmers representatives on this particular point, I revised the minimum participation rate downwards from 80% to 50%. I think it is particularly important to point out that the 50% requirement will be based on active farmers only i.e. those actually grazing the commonage. To give an example, if there are 20 shareholders on a commonage, and 15 are claiming shares under the Single Payment Scheme, but only 10 of those are actively grazing the land at present, the 50% requirement to trigger priority access to GLAS is just 5 farmers.  I believe that 50% participation is the minimum required to achieve the best agri-environmental results for the commonages. I also believe that it represents an achievable target but again, in response to concerns raised by farmers representatives, where real difficulties are encountered, I have already said that the farmers who are having a difficulty in reaching the 50% can approach the Commonage Implementation Committee for advice and assistance.</p><p>  I met this week with a number of farmers who expressed concerns regarding the commonage management plans.  While I have addressed certain elements of these concerns, I am reviewing their submission in the context of the threshold for environmental action which must be demonstrated in order to receive GLAS approval at EU level.</p></reply>

These provisions give rise to the principle of mutual recognition whereby each Member State is obliged to accept onto its market products which are legally manufactured or marketed in another Member State.  My Department attaches considerable importance to the live export trade and, over the years, has been very active in facilitating both the cross border live trade and shipments abroad. Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demands for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for farmers. Total live exports to the end of November this year stand at almost 225,000 head of which 65,000 went to the UK, an increase of some 5,000 head or 8% up on the comparable period in 2013. Of this 65,000, nearly 49,000 went to Northern Ireland which is down only 2.4% on the same period in 2013.  Live exports to Great Britain are up nearly 63% on last year. This does not suggest any failure in the common market. </p><p>  The potential to grow the live trade to the UK even further is constrained by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market. The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately. This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country or the other; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. In addition, logistical difficulties can arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcasses have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. These issues are a matter of commercial preference, both of slaughter plants in the UK and Northern Ireland, and of UK retailers. Decisions by processors and retailers in other member states in relation to purchasing policy are matters of commercial preference. </p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term and are currently under pressure to stock more British beef. Nevertheless Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.  In addition, Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity. </p><p>  I have also had several meetings with my Northern counterpart, Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on this subject.  We agreed to make a joint approach to the three British retailers who stock Irish Beef, accepting that these were commercial matters, but also seeking some flexibility given that this beef is produced to the exacting standards required by British consumers. Following on from this, I convened a meeting with Minister O&rsquo;Neill and the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium which took place in October. At this meeting the NIRC made it clear that their beef buyers had a preference for single origin beef, of which they had ample supply, but they would keep the situation under review.  I also met separately with Tesco where we had a useful and frank discussion on this and other procurement issues. I will continue to pursue opportunities for exports of beef and live cattle at every opportunity.</p></reply>

In an effort to further promote live exports, certificates have also been agreed with Egypt for fattening cattle and slaughter cattle, leaving the way open for commercial transactions to take place.</p></reply>

I anticipate receipt of an initial draft of the White Paper by the end of this year. The final draft of the White Paper will be fully considered by Government in due course.   The White Paper process underway was intended to provide an opportunity to examine critically future demands and consider how we might best meet associated operational requirements. I am conscious that many of the day to day services delivered by Defence are cross-cutting in nature and I believe that Defence resources and expertise should be leveraged to maximum effect for the benefit of the State. In this context, there are opportunities to consider new and innovative approaches to the delivery of a range of important services. Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering likely future operational demands and the types of defence capabilities required to meet these demands. </p><p>  In the course of their deliberations, the Working Groups are taking into consideration the inputs received from a wide variety of stakeholders. Discussions have also been held with a range of Government Departments on cross-cutting policy issues and likely future demands from Government bodies and State agencies. These discussions are continuing, as required, throughout the White Paper process. You will appreciate that I do not wish to second guess any recommendations that may arise from the White Paper process by commenting on specific issues at this point. </p></reply>

As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration. <br/><br/>As Military life places unique physical and psychological demands on individuals it is necessary that its members be physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations and to undertake their duties on deployment overseas<font color="#555555">. I</font>t is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised. As such, in order to maintain the age profile of the PDF to carry out the operational tasks required by Government, it is necessary to have a constant input of recruits into the PDF. The maximum age for personnel who have enlisted in the PDF post 1 January 1994 provides the mechanism through which a satisfactory age profile can be achieved. <br/><br/>However, while there was significant progress made in discussions between PDFORRA and Civil and Military Management it was not possible to reach full agreement. As a result, the issue is being referred to third party adjudication for a ruling. It is expected that the adjudication hearing will take place as soon as possible following the exchange of submissions between the parties. <br/><br/>In the meantime work is continuing on exit support measures to support those due to be discharged. A number of military courses, and other skills courses are already accredited with various Third Level Institutions and Professional Bodies. In addition, a comprehensive training course to aid Transition to Civilian Life for these personnel , which involves a skills appraisal and review of a person&rsquo;s service history and training already provided, is currently being piloted. </p></reply>

It is important to state that in considering this matter the 9th Potential Officers Course personnel who applied to be Officers were aware of the retirement age of 54 for Captains. The two Officers in question are on a promotion panel, and to consider favouring their promotion ahead of others on that panel   would be contrary to the scheme of promotion for Officers as agreed by RACO and voted on collectively by the Officer Corps. It would result in these personnel being promoted ahead of more senior/qualified personnel who are already on an order of merit list for promotion following competitive assessment and interview.  It could also lead to Redresses of Wrongs from other Captains who would be disadvantaged if such personnel were promoted ahead of them.</p></reply>

Each Dublin Metropolitan Region Traffic Inspector is assigned as a point of contact for the public transport operators, and a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address issues that have arisen at specific locations.  Instances of anti-social behaviour are monitored by local Garda management with the assistance of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service, which results in periodic operations aimed at anti-social behaviour on and around public transport routes.  I am further advised that there is effective communication with the respective control centres and that access to good quality CCTV has also been of great assistance in the investigation of complaints.</p><p>  I am assured that Garda&iacute; closely monitors patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and the policing needs in the areas concerned to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  A proactive approach is taken to tackling anti-social behaviour and criminal activity including targeted operations and a high visibility priority policing presence at key locations and pertinent times.  The existing excellent cooperation between Garda&iacute; and transport operators will continue to underpin measures to address any issues of concern that may potentially arise during the Christmas period, including in relation to the volume of people using public transport and the occurrence of alcohol-related antisocial behaviour.</p></reply>

Considerable progress has been achieved since this date, including the publication of the Inter-Departmental Group&rsquo;s Report, the announcement that Judge Yvonne Murphy will chair the Commission and an inclusive consultation process with stakeholders.  The Government has also publicly confirmed that the intended scope of this investigation will go beyond the home operated by the Sisters of Bon Secours in Tuam, Co.

In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.<br/><br/>The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The implementation of the actions contained in the Early Years Quality Agenda, which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,</i>the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.  My Department and I will be keeping this commitment under review in the context of the progress of the Early Years Quality Agenda.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

The Group was not asked to select a site. The Dolphin Report was consistent with all previous reports on the new children&rsquo;s hospital in concluding that co-location with an adult teaching hospital was essential, and tri-location with a maternity hospital was optimal.  It concluded that, from a clinical and academic perspective, St James&rsquo;s Hospital best met the criteria to be the adult partner in co-location. It has the broadest range of national specialties of all acute hospitals, as well as strong and well established research and education infrastructure. Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve. </p><p>  In making its decision, the Government considered the Dolphin Report as well as further detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was sought from members of the Dolphin Group with the relevant technical expertise.  The Government decision to locate the new children's hospital on the St James's campus was announced on 6 November 2012.  The Dolphin report and the supplementary planning assessment were made available on the website of the Department of Health following the Government decision, as were submissions to the Dolphin Group. </p><p>  Ireland's Children deserve a world class hospital.  We have been promising it, and talking about it for too long now.  It is time to build it.</p></reply>

The 12 professions  designated under the Act are clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists. </p><p>  The first registration board  to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applicants on 31st May 2011. Registration Boards subsequently established included those for radiographers, dietitians, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists. The Social Care Workers Registration Board was established on 1st December 2014 and I am currently in the process of  considering a number of suitably qualified and experienced candidates for appointment to the new board. This brings to seven the number of registration boards established to date. I hope to establish the registration boards for the remaining designated professions in 2015.</p><p>  An important element of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 is protection of the public. Provision is made under the Act for a &quot;Fitness to Practice&quot; regime to deal with complaints and disciplinary sanctions in relation to registrants. This provision of the Act, which is to be commenced from the end of this year, will allow concerned members of the public to make a complaint about a registrant. If upheld, disciplinary sanctions can be imposed, including preventing the registrant from practising their profession. The implementation and operation of a robust &quot;Fitness to Practice&quot; process will underpin and ensure adequate client safety.</p><p>  I assume the question is referring to the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) (formerly HETAC) Awards Standards. The QQI Awards Standards determine in broad terms the standards of knowledge, skills and competence for the purposes of education and training awards at different academic levels. The various education and training programmes which seek professional approval by the relevant registration boards would be expected to meet the relevant QQI academic standards.</p></reply>

Government has agreed that the Scheme will also include payments for the small number of women who have had a pubiotomy. The Scheme is designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for the women concerned. Many are elderly and may not want to experience the delay, publicity and financial risks that sometimes come with a court case.  I met the three support groups representing the women last September and their views have helped to shape the Scheme. The Scheme is supported by two of the three groups.  </p><p>  Judge Maureen Harding Clark, retired High Court Judge has been appointed as independent Assessor to the Scheme. Judge Clark, from her previous work on the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme, brings valuable experience to the role of determining the appropriate level of award for each individual. </p><p>  The Symphysiotomy Scheme is open to women who are still living and who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990. Awards of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 will be offered. Details of the Terms of the Scheme and how to access application forms have been widely advertised.</p><p>  Awards will be exempt from tax and legislation is being put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure they are also exempt from being taken into consideration for means tested welfare schemes and for the Nursing Home Support Scheme. </p><p>  It is not a requirement for a woman to retain a Solicitor to make an application.  However, the Scheme makes provision for applicants to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application if they wish.   </p><p>  Applications must be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date, which was 10 November, 2014.  The Closing Date for receipt of applications is therefore Friday 5 December 2014.  In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark has discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.  It is important to note that in the event of a delay arising in the compilation of a woman's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, the application should be submitted within the time period set out in the Scheme with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation. The details of this provision are set out in the terms and conditions of the Scheme, which are available on the Scheme&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  Judge Clark reported that by last Friday, 28 November more than 140 women had applied for awards under the Scheme and to date conditional offers have been made totalling &euro;1,450,000.  There are 4 working days left to apply, including today and I would urge every eligible woman or her representative to submit her application within the appointed timeframe.</p><p>  My Department will be making payments in the case of 7 women shortly and others should have payments before Christmas. </p><p>  The Scheme is voluntary and I would like to emphasise that women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.</p><p>  Government hopes the implementation of this Scheme will help to bring closure on this issue for the women concerned and their families.</p></reply>

Funding is released to approved applicants according to their place, in order of their approval date, on the national placement list.  Over the course of the year to date, demand has exceeded what could be funded and the national placement list has grown as a result.</p><p>  I am aware that waiting times on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme placement list are now at around 14 weeks.  This is not a satisfactory situation and I am trying to address it.</p><p>  In July this year, the HSE allocated &euro;5 million for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.  To date, this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals from the placement list for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and over 200 home care packages to assist patients in the acute hospitals who require a home care package to be discharged.</p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges, of which &euro;10 million will be allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. This is expected to reduce the waiting times that currently apply. In the longer term this issue requires an integrated response across primary, community, and residential services and my Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that available resources are deployed in the most effective way possible.</p><p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently underway will consider the future funding and sustainability of the Scheme as well as how community and residential services are balanced.

Of the 113 such deaths reported in 2011 the majority of these deaths (86%) involved poly-substance poisonings, in addition, 68% of those who died where methadone was implicated were not in opiate substitution treatment at the time of their death.<br/><br/>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the table.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2004</th><th>2005</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th></tr><tr><td>ALL NDRDI poisoning deaths</td><td>267</td><td>300</td><td>326</td><td>389</td><td>386</td><td>374</td><td>338</td><td>365</td></tr><tr><td>Deaths involving Methadone</td><td>40</td><td>43</td><td>61</td><td>55</td><td>80</td><td>69</td><td>60</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>Deaths involving Methadone alone</td><td>11</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>16</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In the majority of cases, overdoses are witnessed by a family member, peer or someone whose work brings them into contact with people who use opioids. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), increased access to naloxone for people likely to witness an overdose could significantly reduce the high numbers of opioid overdose deaths.  </p><p>  In line with  WHO recommendations and the National Drugs Strategy,  the HSE has developed a National Overdose Prevention Strategy which  recommends that naloxone should be made routinely available in Ireland for opioid drug users. The HSE is currently finalising a demonstration project which aims to assess and evaluate the suitability and impact of using naloxone in an Irish context. The project will involve training non-medical staff, such as care workers, family and peers, in the administration of a naloxone injection supplied in a pre-filled syringe. The project will use a similar methodology to a demonstration project carried out in Wales. This will enable the HSE to carry out a comparative analysis of data from both jurisdictions.     </p><p>  Key stakeholders including opioid drug users, carers, family and associated professions are being consulted in relation to the training required to deliver the programme. Locations will be selected according to need  and will involve approximately 600 opioid drug users initially, attending voluntary and statutory addiction services and treatment services in prisons.</p></reply>

To date, it has been ratified by 190 countries.  The Convention provides for privileges and immunities for diplomats and certain other persons working in embassies.  Under the Convention, it is the duty of all persons enjoying diplomatic privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the host State, including any applicable labour laws.  Consistent with the State&rsquo;s obligations under the Vienna Convention, my Department works to ensure that the law is upheld and my Department will assist, as appropriate, in any investigation being undertaken by the relevant Irish authorities.  Persons working for embassies &ndash; i.e. foreign governments &ndash; may in certain circumstances bring legal proceedings in relation to their employment against that government, subject to the rules of state immunity, also known as sovereign immunity.  State immunity is not regulated by the Vienna Convention.  However, a distinction must be drawn between individuals working for embassies and those working for individual diplomats as private domestic workers.  Any legal proceedings brought by a private domestic worker against their diplomat employer will be subject to the rules set out in the Vienna Convention.  Although an international review of the Convention is not envisaged at this point in time, Ireland as well as many of our EU and OSCE partners keep under on-going consideration how best we can meet our international and national obligations. </p><p>  My interest in the promotion of best employment practices led to my introduction last September of new guidelines for diplomatic staff who intend to employ private domestic workers.  These guidelines set out clearly expectations regarding such matters as payment, working hours, employment records and health insurance. Upon publication of the guidelines, my Department arranged a briefing for all resident diplomatic Missions and followed up in writing with those Missions. My Department continues to monitor the implementation of the guidelines closely.</p><p>  While I believe that the majority of diplomatic staff in Ireland already follow good practices, it is my view that the obligations as set out under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations combined with the effective implementation of best practices in the form of these new guidelines provide the best way forward to ensure the protection of domestic workers employed by diplomats in Ireland.</p></reply>

These include advancing reconciliation and cooperation on the island of Ireland; representing and advancing Government policies with other States and in international organisations; economic, trade and cultural promotion; front-line consular and passport services to Irish citizens; engaging with Irish communities abroad; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries. These tasks require extensive engagement with our international partners, including through face-to-face Ministerial meetings. Trade promotion and economic messaging are key elements in all visits abroad undertaken by Government Ministers. Every effort is made to ensure that, as far as is practicable, opportunities are taken for a substantive economic and promotional dimension to all official visits.  An intensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions is a key commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs in 2014 and planning is underway for the programme trade missions in 2015.  In terms of travel for the remainder of 2014, I intend to accompany the President on his State Visit to China next week and the Ministers of State expect to attend meetings as follows: <br/><br/><i>Minister of State Sherlock</i><br/><br/>11-12 December: Foreign Affairs Council (Development), Brussels<br/><br/>3-4 December: OSCE Ministerial Council in Basel<br/><br/><i>Minister of State Murphy</i><br/><br/>4-5 December: Justice and Home Affairs Council, Brussels <br/><br/>14 -19 December<font color="#004080">:</font>Foreign Affairs<font color="#004080">,</font>General Affairs and European Councils, Brussels<br/><br/>Next year's plans are still under development but I expect to travel to New York in late September 2015 to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations and to address that body on Irish foreign policy priorities.  I will also meet with Foreign Ministers and UN leaders there, to discuss a range of international issues, as well as bilateral issues and Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2020.  Given the importance of our economic relationship with the United States, I anticipate, as on previous visits, to prioritise opportunities to advance our economic interests and will work closely with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland on an appropriate economic promotion programme.  In addition, I plan to attend EU related meetings, including meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council and Informal Meetings of EU Foreign Ministers, on a regular basis<b></b>throughout 2015. I expect that my colleagues will be similarly engaged on EU and other matters.  My schedule over the coming months will include a visit to Kiev and, following my recent visit to Cairo to participate in the Gaza reconstruction conference, I intend to visit the Middle East at the earliest opportunity.<br/><br/>Minister of State Deenihan is expected to travel to Washington D.C. in mid-January 2015. Other travel undertaken by Minister Deenihan in 2015 will be planned around ensuring that the Government connects in the most effective possible way with our migrant and diaspora communities.</p></reply>

From the outset, the Embassy of Ireland in Cairo has had continuous contact with the Egyptian authorities in relation to the case. Contacts have included numerous meetings at Ambassadorial level with senior officials from the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Justice, and the office of the Prosecutor General. Embassy officials have also visited the individual in detention on over thirty occasions.   I have met this individual&rsquo;s family and given them assurances regarding the continued assistance of my Department. Separately, officials in the Consular Division of my Department remain in ongoing, regular contact with them and have discussed the case with representatives of the Egyptian Embassy here in Dublin.</p><p>  I have raised this case through direct contacts with the Egyptian government and through the European Union, including the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.   On my first day in office as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I called my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, to raise the Government&rsquo;s concerns about the continued detention of this individual and the importance of due process in his case. I have since discussed this case with Minister Shoukry on a number of occasions. I have emphasised that this individual was only seventeen when the alleged offences took place, and the necessity for him to return to Ireland as soon as possible to continue his studies for his Leaving Certificate examination. I have asked that the charges against this individual be reviewed, and that he be released and permitted to return home to Ireland.</p><p>  Ireland is precluded from directly interfering with the judicial process in Egypt. This is a difficult case in a complex and challenging context.  </p><p>  However, our concern at the continued and lengthy period of detention continues to be raised with the Egyptian authorities in a clear and sustained manner, together with the critical importance of due process in this case. It is the Government&rsquo;s view that this individual should not be tried as part of a group trial involving a large number of defendants and on the basis of group charges, but solely on the basis of specific evidence. </p><p>  The trial of this individual and his co-accused which was scheduled to be heard on 1 December was postponed until 6 January 2015.  The Ambassador in Cairo attended the court on 1 December, and met with the individual after the hearing. I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that my officials will continue to work on this case and to raise the issue with our counterparts in Egypt, with a view to securing a review of his case, his release and return to his family.</p></reply>

Bus &Eacute;ireann has further advised that the opinion of the Bus &Eacute;ireann Chief Medical Officer is that, given the demanding and safety critical nature of School Bus driving, 70 years of age is deemed a reasonable age at which to retire from such employment. <br/><br/>A Contractor may continue to hold the Contract to provide a school bus service on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann when over the age of seventy years, using a nominated driver to provide their service.<br/><br/>Provided a bus over twenty years old is subject to regular maintenance of a high standard and continues to satisfy the requirements of the RSA/Department of Transport and statutory obligations, that bus may be used to provide public bus services.  Many buses over twenty years old do so privately throughout the State.Under the School Transport Scheme and in relation to the operation of services on its behalf, Bus Eireann has set a goal to withdraw buses from daily service at twenty years to provide a better quality service in line with public demands, which is why buses over twenty years are generally not engaged under contract or utilised in daily service.</p></reply>

My  Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils' not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory, and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. <br/><br/>  Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that, as regards that policy, principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.<br/><br/>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department or, in the case of an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student, or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. <br/><br/>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil's home area. The contact details for the EWS is Educational Welfare Services, Block 3, South Dublin County Council, Tallaght, Dublin 24, Phone 01 4635513.<br/><br/>  My Department provides for a range of placement options for pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that all pupils can receive a school placement. Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school whereas, for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for.<br/><br/>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>The NCSE also recently published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School. This guide is also available at www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government gave approval in March of this year for drafting the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2014, and drafting by the Attorney General is currently underway. The aim of bringing forward legislative proposals in relation to school admission is to improve the admissions process, and to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<br/><br/>  It is a matter for schools to then monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.<br/><br/>  Schools have capacity to allocate resource teaching or learning support hours to pupils who have additional learning needs arising from medical conditions, from within their General Allocation Model hours.<br/><br/>  A parent who feels that their child requires additional learning support in school should raise this matter directly with their school Principal in the first instance, or with the Board of Management of the school.</p></reply>

Statistics on local authority housing stock, including units that may be empty, are published annually by the Local Government Management Agency.

The number of such units in each Local Authority area is set out in the table.  I anticipate that this target will be achieved and it is a matter for each individual local authority to allocate these units to those on their social housing waiting lists.<br/><br/>Budget 2015 has given a further impetus to this area, and I envisage a further 1,000 vacant properties being returned to productive use through this additional funding.<table><tr><th>Vacant Units to be returned to productive use in 2014 </th><th>Local Authority </th></tr><tr><td>26 </td><td>Carlow </td></tr><tr><td>15 </td><td>Cavan </td></tr><tr><td>42 </td><td>Clare </td></tr><tr><td>186 </td><td>Cork City </td></tr><tr><td>155 </td><td>Cork County </td></tr><tr><td>115 </td><td>Donegal </td></tr><tr><td>371 </td><td>Dublin City </td></tr><tr><td>147 </td><td>Fingal </td></tr><tr><td>75 </td><td>South Dublin </td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown </td></tr><tr><td>42 </td><td>Galway City </td></tr><tr><td>62 </td><td>Galway County </td></tr><tr><td>45 </td><td>Kerry </td></tr><tr><td>67 </td><td>Kildare </td></tr><tr><td>25 </td><td>Kilkenny </td></tr><tr><td>27 </td><td>Laois </td></tr><tr><td>15 </td><td>Leitrim </td></tr><tr><td>86 </td><td>Limerick </td></tr><tr><td>15 </td><td>Longford </td></tr><tr><td>10 </td><td>Louth </td></tr><tr><td>81 </td><td>Mayo </td></tr><tr><td>53 </td><td>Meath </td></tr><tr><td>11 </td><td>Monaghan </td></tr><tr><td>31 </td><td>Offaly </td></tr><tr><td>21 </td><td>Roscommon </td></tr><tr><td>26 </td><td>Sligo </td></tr><tr><td>66 </td><td>Tipperary </td></tr><tr><td>48 </td><td>Waterford </td></tr><tr><td>46 </td><td>Westmeath </td></tr><tr><td>16 </td><td>Wexford </td></tr><tr><td>32 </td><td>Wicklow </td></tr><tr><td>1,960 </td><td>Total </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In committing to provide 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, the strategy marks a fresh start for social housing in Ireland.  It is estimated that this level of investment will create or sustain some 29,000 construction industry jobs.  Importantly, the Strategy restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through a resumption of direct building on a significant scale, primarily by local authorities and approved housing bodies.</p><p>  The strategy will be delivered in two phases. Phase 1 targets the delivery of 18,000 additional housing units and 32,400 Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme units by the end of 2017.  In phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, the strategy targets the delivery of 17,000 additional units and 43,000 Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme units.</p><p>  In the initial phase, increased Exchequer funding is necessary to underpin delivery.  The Government has already committed this initial funding, through the &euro;2.2 billion announced as part of Budget 2015.  The provision of this funding will allow time for the work to be carried out to move towards more off-balance sheet funding, through the extension to the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle, a large scale Public Private Partnership and the establishment of a 'Strategic Housing Fund'.</p><p>  The strategy provides a clear governance structure which , as Minister, I will personally oversee to ensure delivery.  Action 1 of the Strategy requires the agreement of targets for delivery of social housing next year and in subsequent years.  These specific targets will be agreed through the governance structure, which is currently being put in place, in collaboration with local authorities and with input from the approved housing body sector.  For 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided under the range of existing initiatives broken down as follows: 3,000 units through leasing initiative; 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme units; 1,000 vacant local authority units will be refurbished and brought back to use; with a further 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies through the Social Housing Investment Programme and Capital Assistance Scheme.  A further 8,400 households will be assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment.</p><p>  While local authorities are responsible for the detailed planning of social housing provision based on the needs of their areas, my Department is working with all authorities, within the context of the increased funding now available, to advance projects already in train and to plan for further developments directly by local authorities and by approved housing bodies to meet the Social Housing Strategy targets for 2015 and beyond.</p></reply>

As I outlined in response to the Parliamentary Questions on this matter on 23 October, policy action across a range of areas is required to support developers in bringing ocean energy devices from prototype to full scale commerciality. This action is now being taken in the context of the implementation of the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan which was published earlier this year. </p><p>  The Ocean Energy Development Unit of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) was specifically established to take forward the development of this important sector.

Maintaining a commercial vehicle in a safe and roadworthy condition over its lifetime requires on-going inspection and maintenance and, since September 2013, all commercial vehicle operators, including school bus operators, are required to have maintenance systems in place.  The relevant regulations in this regard are the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness)(Vehicle Maintenance and Repair) Regulations 2013 (SI 348 of 2013).</p><p>  Under these regulations, the owner of a commercial vehicle is responsible for determining the frequency of inspections and maintenance of vehicles having regard to a number of factors including the condition of the vehicle, mileage, the use of the vehicle and manufacturers guidelines. </p><p>  These new obligations were introduced as part of the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Reform Programme which had its inception in the Kentstown and Clara bus accidents in which a number of school children tragically lost their lives.  The Reform Programme has introduced major changes in the areas of vehicle testing, operator obligations and roadside enforcement which are intended to bring about a step change in the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles. </p><p>  There are many excellent school bus operators providing services and I commend them for their commitment to the safe transport of our children.  However, it is of concern to me that, of the 750 school buses inspected by RSA Vehicle Inspectors at roadside inspections in the last six months, the RSA detected that over 50% were found to have defects with 25% of these defects being serious or very serious.  Furthermore, I understand from the RSA that almost 30% of the school bus vehicles which were tested between 1st November 2013 and 31st October 2014 failed the annual roadworthiness test.  Worryingly, 8 of these school bus vehicles were so defective that they were issued with a Fail Dangerous notice at the time of the test.</p><p>  From an enforcement perspective, there has been, and will continue to be, a particular focus on school buses for the foreseeable future by the RSA and An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The working group, on which the IRFU and relevant Government Departments from both jurisdictions were represented, has reported and, in conjunction with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, Minister Donohoe and I have been examining the report and considering the most appropriate next steps.   </p><p>  My Department is developing a new National Sports Policy which will be the framework for the new body, Sport Ireland, following the merger of the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority, and will have regard to international best practice.  It will also examine cross-sectoral issues such as the role of sport in education and health and where the focus on Government spending in sport should be.   </p><p>  I would also mention the impact of the Sports Capital Programme which helps to create jobs across all areas of the country. I was delighted to announce that I have secured funding for another round of the Programme in 2015. This will be the third round of the Programme since this Government was elected to office and follows from an investment of &euro;30m in 2012 and &euro;40m in 2014.</p></reply>

I would point out that national transport costs are driven by a number of factors including demographic, economic, spatial and cultural trends and thus any comparison between jurisdictions can be problematic. My Department does seek to stay abreast of any international research which tracks comparable costs.  The various agencies and regulators in the transport sector also monitor the relevant costs of transport in Ireland and may do cross-comparison analysis with other jurisdictions as they see fit.  A number of user transport costs are set independently by the relevant regulators. </p><p>  I should also point out that my Department has also carried out some cross-national analysis of transport investment levels as part of the work underpinning the draft Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport. This analysis is publically available on the Department's website through the consultation process (Background Paper No.10) and the final Policy Framework is due to be published in Q1 of 2015.</p></reply>

It may be noted, however, that, generally speaking, my Department does not make arts grants to individuals but to organisations. Such organisations are required to be not-for-profit and trading. In addition, grant payments by my Department are made only by electronic funds transfer to the bank account of grantees. Arrangements applied by bodies that award arts grants would be an operational matter for the bodies in question.</p></reply>
