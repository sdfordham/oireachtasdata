I have publicly stated my intention to develop and bring forward legislative proposals providing for a statutory Parole Board and this was also a commitment in the Fine Gael manifesto earlier this year. </p>  <p>  Draft proposals have been under development in my Department to establish a statutory Parole Board which will set out the Board&rsquo;s functions, powers and structure.  The objective is a more effective and streamlined parole process which, while being of benefit to the prisoner, will always have public safety as a paramount concern.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Parole Bill 2016, a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, was introduced by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan on 24 May 2016.  The aim of this Bill is also to establish the Parole Board as an independent statutory body and confer on it responsibility for granting parole to eligible offenders.  </p>  <p>  The Bill completed Second Stage in this House on 15 June 2016.  As the principle of establishing the Parole Board on a statutory basis is in line with Government policy, on that basis I did not oppose the Bill.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of legal and technical difficulties which must be addressed to ensure any new framework is constitutionally and legally sound and operationally practicable and effective.  The principal concerns with the Parole Bill introduced into the House last week relate to potential constitutional issues arising from a Parole Board completely independent of the Executive, the appeal mechanism, the issuing of warrants by the board, the exemption of certain categories of offenders and the quasi-judicial nature of the board as envisaged in the Bill.  The financial implications must also be considered.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to the establishment of a statutory Parole Board.  Both the proposals under development within my Department and those in Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s Parole Bill are being considered in conjunction with each other, and I look forward to engaging with Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan in this regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-22a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062200069#WRA00900"><p>As the Deputy is aware, there has been significant change in the procedures for members of the Garda&iacute; who wish to report allegations of wrongdoing.</p>  <p>  Prior to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 coming into operation, whistleblowing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was provided for under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007.  Those Regulations were revoked by the 2014 Act and an entirely new system was put in place.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Act was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistleblowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  GSOC is a statutorily independent body under the Garda S&iacute;ochana Act.</p>  <p>  However, Garda&iacute; who wish to make protected disclosures may do so to other persons who are prescribed for this purpose.  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints/allegations are fully investigated, I signalled during the D&aacute;il debate on the O'Higgins Report that I would refer certain matters to the independent Policing Authority.  To that end, I wrote to the Authority on 2 June 2016 requesting that in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers/whistleblowing.  I also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints/allegations in a safe environment where their complaints/allegations are properly investigated.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is also no doubt aware of the measures that the Garda Commissioner outlined at her recent meeting with the Policing Authority.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published its Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda Members and civilians have been informed of this policy.  In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who will be supported with a dedicated and properly trained team.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are protected and supported.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is committed to providing a positive and supportive working environment for all Garda personnel.  An  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Dignity at Work Policy, entitled "Working Together to Create a Positive Working Environment", outlines the policy and procedures for dealing with Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying in the Workplace.  The main Objective of the policy is to achieve a safe and harmonious working environment that encourages and supports the right to dignity at work.  I am informed that the Commissioner has established  an internal Garda Work Group to review the current practice and policies in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  and this work is currently ongoing.</p>  <p>  All of this points to the very significant changes in the regime for making protected disclosures by members of the Garda&iacute; and the significant protections afforded to those who make protected disclosures.  I am satisfied that the legislative and administrative provisions now in place will prove to be an effective remedy for Garda members who wish to report their concerns regarding potential wrongdoing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-22a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062200069#WRA01100"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the instigation and management of any criminal investigation is a matter for the Garda authorities.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that I have no role in this regard and that I would not normally receive reports in relation to investigations.</p>  <p>  On a general note, however, I can say that, as an organisation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes its responsibility for the control of the information it possesses about individuals very seriously.  Unauthorised disclosure of information can impede the investigation of an offence and the apprehension or prosecution of suspected offenders and can seriously undermine public confidence in the ability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out its functions.  </p>  <p>  I understand from the Garda Commissioner that it is the policy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that overall responsibility for releasing Garda information to the media rests with the Garda Press and Public Relations Office.  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are prohibited, except in specified circumstances, without the authority of the Commissioner from communicating either directly or indirectly with the media or furnishing to the media any information in connection with the investigation of crime or other official matters. </p>  <p>  Any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who leaks information to the media is not only contravening clear Garda policy, but is also contravening the law.  It is an offence under the Official Secrets Act 1963 for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as for any public official, to disclose official information without lawful authority.  It is also, quite separately, a distinct offence under section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make an unauthorised disclose of information obtained in the course of duty if the member knows that such disclosure is likely to have a harmful effect.  The section sets out a list of instances of harmful effect covered by this offence, which includes for example disclosures which result in the publication of personal information constituting an unwarranted and serious infringement of a person's right to privacy.  The penalty for such an offence, upon conviction on indictment, is a term of imprisonment for up to 5 years and-or a maximum fine of &euro;50,000.</p>  <p>  Any member of the public who believes that he or she has been the subject of unauthorised disclosure of information by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may make a complaint to the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which has extensive powers of investigation.</p></reply>

The Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers, has set out a series of recommendations for reform of the system.  These have implications for a number of Government Departments and services. </p>  <p>  The Report indicated a two-way approach towards improving the life of persons within the protection process by (i) improving the application process and thereby reducing the length of time spent by applicants in State provided accommodation and (ii) improving the quality of life of those in accommodation through improvements of services within the accommodation system itself but also the supports available through other agencies and bodies. </p>  <p>  The 173 recommendations in the Report were taken forward by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  To date, a total of 91 recommendations have been implemented, a further 49 recommendations have been partially implemented or are in progress, and the balance remain under consideration. </p>  <p>  The International Protection Act 2015 responds to 26 of the Report's recommendations.  The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection which is a key recommendation of the Report.  The single procedure is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time that persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing. </p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency is working on solutions in respect of the key improvements in living conditions and catering solutions for families.  Catering solutions are already in place in some centres and a pilot project will be commenced shortly at an additional centre with a view to rolling out that model across centres in the coming months.  Work is also advancing on extending the remit of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children to include Direct Provision centres.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-22a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062200069#WRA01400"><p>Insert questionThe current statutory complaints procedure for prisoners was introduced in 2013 following on from recommendations made by the Inspector in 2012.  It was an improvement over the pre-existing procedures and provided for an independent element in the investigation of serious complaints.  Details of that system are further outlined in my response to D&aacute;il Question 113 on 4 May 2016.</p><p>The report of the Inspector of Prisons on the prisoner complaints system &ldquo;Review, Evaluation and Analysis of the Operation of the present Irish Prison Service Complaints Procedure&rdquo; was published on 8 June 2016 and is available on my Department's website - <i><i>www.justice.ie</i></i>.  This identified a number of concerns in the implementation of the current complaints procedure.  Arising from this I met with the Inspector of Prisons to discuss his findings.  The Inspector made it clear to me that he considered the Irish Prison Service has to retain a central role in the complaints process but with independent oversight and that he was satisfied that a fair and effective complaints procedure could be achieved with the implementation of his recommendations.  I also had a separate meeting with Director General of the Irish Prison Service to see what action needed to be taken following on from the report.</p><p>In the light of this report it is clear that more needs to be done before we have a system that will gain the full confidence of staff, prisoners and the general public.  One of the key recommendations in the Inspector's report is that prisoners&rsquo; complaints would be subject to review by the Ombudsman who would also be able to deal with complaints directly in the case of undue delay.  I accept this recommendation and my officials have already had an initial exploratory meeting with the Ombudsman's office and will be raising this issue with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>Another recommendation is that complaints would also be categorised as either serious Category A or minor Category B and that a robust investigative mechanism must be put in place, in prisons, to ensure the proper investigation of Category A complaints.  While I fully accept this recommendation I am concerned that replacing external investigators with an internal IPS team of investigators might give rise to a perception of bias.  I have directed that more training be provided for external investigators and that this independent investigative element be maintained for a 12 month period and then reviewed.</p><p>I have also accepted further recommendations in the report.  These include resolving minor complaints at the lowest level; allowing prisoners make complaints to relevant professional bodies; prisoners being entitled to an explanation for decisions made affecting them; frivolous and vexatious complaints being addressed and fair procedures applying.  Similarly the recommendations on adequate training, adhering to protocols and statutory obligations, holding staff to account, not hindering the complaints procedure and having an effective communication system are accepted.</p><p>In my meeting with the Inspector about his report, I specifically asked him to keep the complaints procedure under review and to give her regular reports.  I emphasised that the rights of all prisoners, including vulnerable prisoners, have to be promoted and an effective complaints system is just one aspect of achieving this goal.</p><p>While some amendment to secondary legislation may be required to effect these recommendations, it is not envisaged that primary legislation would be required.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-22a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062200070#WRB00200"><p>The Programme for Government states, as the Deputy notes, that the Government will '<i>establish a dedicated new court to sensitively and expeditiously handle mortgage arrears and other personal insolvency cases, including through imposing solutions'</i>, including those recommended by a new national service which will be established '<i>to standardise the supports available to borrowers in mortgage arrears'</i>.  It adds that the hearings of this Court '<i>could be held in private if requested by the debtor'</i>.</p><p>As the Deputy will know, the commitments in the Programme for Government are under active consideration by the Government as part of the Government's housing strategy.  An action programme will be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>The objectives underlying the commitment regarding a dedicated new Court are, as indicated, to ensure that mortgage arrears cases can be handled sensitively and quickly.  We are already looking at a range of possible solutions to serve these objectives, up to and including the establishment of a separate specialist court by legislation.  Work is progressing to explore and assess the options available to government to implement this recommendation as speedily and as effectively as possible.</p><p>Currently, the vast majority of repossession cases are heard by the Circuit Court for the circuit in which the house is situated.  The High Court hears a small number of cases regarding very high-value houses.  The Circuit Court cases are heard by the ordinary Circuit Court judges, at over 30 venues around the country: preliminary issues may be heard by the Registrar, before a case is transferred to the judge for hearing.  Some circuits reserve a specific date for repossession cases, while others hear repossession cases along with other civil law cases such as family law or commercial cases.  The courts sit in public as is the general rule: legislative change would be needed to allow them to hear repossession cases in private.</p><p>Based on the data provided by the Courts Service, the number of repossession orders is falling.  In Q1/2016, there were about 95 possession orders per month - less than half the monthly average in Q1/2015.  And in over twice as many cases (200 per month on average last quarter) the repossession application was struck out, refused or withdrawn.  However, I fully agree that the number of repossession cases remains undesirably high, particularly in terms of the worry and stress experienced by borrowers who are struggling with their debts.  I have already taken extensive action to address these problems under the previous Government.  This Government wants to keep people in their homes, and the new Housing action programme, to be announced shortly, will evidence our strong commitment to putting solutions in place.</p><p>In terms of giving a statutory right to mortgage holders to certain solutions, as the Deputy will be aware, where the borrower's home is in mortgage arrears the borrower may already be entitled to a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA), which is a protected statutory solution, under the Personal Insolvency Acts.</p><p>In addition, last year I introduced an important reform for mortgage holders in arrears, especially those at risk of repossession, in the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015.  Section 21 of that Act introduces a new &lsquo;court review&rsquo;, where creditors such as a mortgage lender refuse an insolvent borrower&rsquo;s proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement to resolve debts which include the mortgage on their home.</p><p>Previously, the creditors&rsquo; rejection was final.  Under the new provision, the borrower can seek review by the relevant Court of the creditors&rsquo; refusal.

This is done using two processes known as <i>revaluation</i>and <i>revision</i>.</p><p>Revaluation is a process where all properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date.  After the first revaluation of a Local Authority area is completed, revaluation is then scheduled to take place every five to ten years to reflect changes in economic circumstances since the last revaluation took place.  Revision, on the other hand, is intended to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the Valuation Lists of new properties between revaluations.  The national revaluation programme is the first general valuation of all commercial property in the state since the middle of the 19th century.  It is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 146,000 properties.  Completing the first revaluation and getting properties in every Local Authority area onto the 5-10 year cycle of revaluations, provided for in the legislation, will represent a sea-change for the valuation system.</p><p>The present position is that all rateable properties in the Dublin, Waterford and Limerick local authority areas are now revalued.  These 48,000 properties represent approximately 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms.  In addition,13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been valued on a global basis.  Significant progress is being made and the programme has established a momentum which will be shortly built upon as the Commissioner has made valuation orders for the revaluation of seven more Local Authorities.  While the revaluation programme has been underway, the Valuation Office has continued to carry out revision work and since 2011 a total of 30,206 revision valuations were completed and certified while simultaneously carrying out the revaluations of Dublin City, Waterford and Limerick.</p><p>However, in order to complete the revaluation on a nationwide basis in the most timely manner, the programme will need to be accelerated and this is the main objective of the relevant provisions of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 8 June 2015.  The measures in the Act will enable the Commissioner of Valuation to accelerate the national programme of revaluation including provisions for Outsourcing, Occupier Assisted Valuation, streamlining the appeal process and wider use of computer-aided and statistical techniques.  Occupier Assisted Valuation is the term being used for the form of self-assessment that will be introduced as it better reflects what will happen in practice.  Valuation of commercial property is often a very complex process resulting in annual rates bills that can be very significant for the individual ratepayer.  This requires the application of a uniform approach based on assessing the potential annual rental value of each property and is a more complex exercise than the self-assessment of, say, Local Property Tax.</p><p>Occupier Assisted Valuation has the potential however to be a valuable new addition which will help to accelerate the revaluation programme and will bring the ratepayer into closer contact with a system that is one of the key determinants of his or her rates liability.  Self-assessment, in an appropriate form, is therefore being introduced by the new legislation.  Now that the legislation is in place, the Commissioner has commenced arrangements to pilot Occupier Assisted Valuation in one Local Authority area &ndash; County Laois - initially and is also using the enabling provisions in the new legislation to avail of external valuation resources to conduct the revaluation of counties Carlow and Kilkenny.  Utilising these new measures to supplement the proven capacity of the Valuation Office to deliver revaluations will see significant progress towards a more rapid completion of the national programme of revaluation.  The results of the piloting of the Occupier Assisted Valuation system in County Laois will be critically appraised before a decision is taken by the Commissioner as to whether it is appropriate to use in revaluation projects commencing in other rating authority areas.</p></reply>

Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.

The counsel appointed to the panel were nominated by the Attorney General and were all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.</p>  <p>  A total of 320 cases were referred to the Panel.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June 2015 and concluded on 8 February, 2016.</p>  <p>  - In 318 cases the complainants were notified of the final outcome of the review of their cases.</p>  <p>  - In 1 case the recommendation was of an interim nature whereby the complainant was invited to submit further material.  The complainant has provided such material which is currently being considered by counsel.</p>  <p>  - In 1 case the complainant had passed away.</p>  <p>  The reports provided by counsel and containing their recommendations in each case constitute legal advice to me and they are, accordingly, subject to legal professional privilege.  While the report and recommendations from counsel were not provided to complainants, I have sought to ensure that letters to complainants should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline, as far as possible, the reasons for the recommendation.  To that end I appointed a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of the letters and independently vouch for the fact that the summaries of conclusions and the reasoning behind them are a fair reflection of counsel's advice.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to be engaged on the follow up actions arising from the recommendations made by counsel.  These include consultations which are on-going with the Attorney General related to the terms of reference for a number of statutory inquiries under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings.  Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.  I know that some Deputies have argued that the review should have involved interviews with the complainants and other relevant persons, but I think that is to misunderstand this process.  To have required counsel to hold hearings where they would interview everyone concerned would in effect have been to hold full-scale investigations into over 300 cases, without having made any attempt to see if this was necessary or practical.</p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further action was recommended by the review then that will occur.  And that is, indeed, what has happened.  I have made a number of requests to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission under section 102 (5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to investigate certain matters.  I have sought reports from the Garda Commissioner with a view to informing complainants of relevant matters.  In a small number of cases, I will be establishing statutory inquiries under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  In a large proportion of cases counsel did not recommend any further action by me because no such action could reasonably be taken, particularly in cases which had already been through the legal process or because they involved complaints against statutorily independent bodies, with whose decisions I could not interfere.  In no case did counsel recommend that a Commission of Investigation be established.</p>  <p>  I am aware that many complainants were unhappy with the outcome of the review process.  In circumstances where individuals have genuine but necessarily subjective concerns about how their particular cases were originally handled, it is inevitable that many complainants who were informed that no further action was recommended, or where the recommendation fell short of what they had hoped for, would be unhappy with that outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who have made an objective recommendation based on the details supplied by the complainants themselves.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-22a.49.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062200070#WRB01800"><p>I am satisfied that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has the support it needs to carry out its important work, including in respect of its role in relation to protected disclosures.  GSOC's budget for 2016 is &euro;9.546 million, which represents an increase of some &euro;500,000 on the 2015 amount.  2015 also saw an increase in the number of staff working for GSOC.</p>  <p>  Members of An Garda S&iacute;ochana who wish to make a protected disclosure may do so in accordance with the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014.  The Act replaced the previous system of making disclosures to a Confidential Recipient.  The 2014 Act put Garda&iacute; in the same position, including receiving the same statutory protections, as others who wish to make a protected disclosure about alleged wrongdoing.</p>  <p>  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistleblowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure to GSOC, which is a statutorily independent body, for investigation.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Annual report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which I will shortly be laying before the Houses, states that there were 4 protected disclosures made to GSOC in 2015.  I am satisfied that GSOC is adequately resourced to deal with disclosures made under the 2014 Act.  I am also satisfied that GSOC has the appropriate powers and experience to carry out its role in dealing with any protected disclosures made to them.</p>  <p>  As the House will recall I published the report of the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation which had found serious failings in a number of Garda investigations in the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  Arising from those findings, which were debated in this House, I signalled my intention to refer certain matters to the Policing Authority for their consideration.  To that end, I wrote to the Policing Authority on 2 June, 2016 requesting that, in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers/whistleblowing.  I also asked that the Authority make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints/allegations in a safe environment where those complaints/allegations are properly investigated.  I look forward to receiving the Authority's report in due course.</p></reply>

We are therefore committed to reforming the Direct Provision system, with particular focus on families and children."</p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers, has implications for a number of Government Departments and services.  The Direct Provision system comprises not just accommodation but a range of services including health, education and welfare supports.</p>  <p>  The McMahon Report indicated a two-way approach towards improving the life of persons within the protection process by (i) improving the application process and thereby reducing the length of time spent by applicants in State provided accommodation and (ii) improving the quality of life of those in accommodation through improvements of services within the accommodation system itself but also the supports available through other agencies and bodies.</p>  <p>  The 173 recommendations in the Report were taken forward by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  To date, a total of 91 have been implemented, a further 49 recommendations have been partially implemented or are in progress, and the balance remain under consideration.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to reforming the Direct Provision system, with particular focus on families and children and to that end the International Protection Act 2015 responds to 26 of the Report's recommendations.  The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection which is a key recommendation of the Report.  The single procedure is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency is working on solutions in respect of the key improvements in living conditions and catering solutions for families.  Catering solutions are already in place in some centres and a pilot project will be commenced shortly at an additional centre with a view to rolling out that model across centres in the coming months.</p></reply>

The 16,000 disclosures reported to Women&rsquo;s Aid of domestic violence in 2015 and almost 6000 disclosures of child abuse represent 9,300 individuals ringing the phoneline. This serves as a stark reminder that the menace that is domestic violence remains a major problem for this society and that we must do all we can to end it. </p>  <p>  This Government, and I as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, remain committed to tackling domestic violence. There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to full implementation of the Istanbul Convention. </p>  <p>  All the actions required for ratification of the Istanbul Convention are included in the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 which was launched in January. The bulk of the strategy&rsquo;s actions focus on supporting victims and holding perpetrators to account. The Programme for Government also commits to the implementation of the strategy.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to publish the Domestic Violence Bill this year. The Bill will improve access to barring orders and provide for greater supports for victims in the court process in areas such as court accompaniment.</p>  <p>  Protecting and supporting victims is a key priority. The proposed legislation to support victims of domestic violence builds on the broader Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime Bill) Bill which is being drafted for publication as a priority.</p>  <p>  I&rsquo;m particularly pleased to have secured almost &euro;1m for 2016 to undertake the development and implementation of a national awareness campaign, which will run for six years, in order to change behaviours and attitudes in relation to domestic and sexual violence, and to activate bystanders with the aim of preventing domestic violence. Much progress has been made in advancing this campaign.</p>  <p>  It is my hope that actions being undertaken by my Department and others to tackle the scourge of domestic violence will improve the situation for women and children and remove any barriers to them seeking the support they need.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner, in summary, that there were 27 stations on 30 April 2011 with 318 members assigned to the Laois / Offaly Division.  On 30 April 2016 there were 24 stations in the Laois / Offaly Division with<b></b>286<b></b>Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division.<b></b>As the Deputy will understand, there is a significant amount of information available down to station / sub-district level which he has requested.  For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested for the record.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 24 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Laois / Offaly Garda Division to date.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.

The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.  We are on track to ratify the Convention within 6 months.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015, and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 was passed by the Seanad on 26 January this year.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is also underway on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification. It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.

Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of the proceeds of crimes legislation, money-laundering legislation, and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also maintains close liaison with other law enforcement agencies internationally and the work of Garda liaison officers who are permanently based in other jurisdictions and in international bodies such as Interpol and Europol, greatly facilitate the prompt exchange of information and intelligence on criminal activity. Such international liaison has led to many parallel investigations with international law enforcement agencies. </p>  <p>  Having regard to more recent serious organised crime activity, a number of targeted additional measures have been announced in support of the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  I have just recently announced a range of measures including legislative proposals to provide additional powers to the Criminal Assets Bureau in targeting the proceeds of crime, an additional allocation of &euro;55 million to be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year in support of targeted measure and a review of our legislation to see whether there are other changes in the law which might be made to address the reality of groups intent on carrying out a sustained series of killings while endangering the safety of communities.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has also announced the establishment of a new Garda Special Crime Task Force to augment existing responses to organised crime at a local level.  </p>  <p>  In addition, at the request of the Garda Commissioner earlier this year, funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) for the Dublin Metropolitan Region in order to enhanced armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.</p>  <p>  These measures have been brought forward alongside the proposals announced for accelerated recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that tackling organised crime is a priority for the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

The 16,000 disclosures reported to Women&rsquo;s Aid of domestic violence in 2015 and almost 6000 disclosures of child abuse represent 9,300 individuals ringing the phoneline. This serves as a stark reminder that the menace that is domestic violence remains a major problem for this society and that we must do all we can to end it.</p>  <p>  This Government, and I as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, remain committed to tackling domestic violence. There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to full implementation of the Istanbul Convention. </p>  <p>  All the actions required for ratification of the Istanbul Convention are included in the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 which was launched in January. The bulk of the strategy&rsquo;s actions focus on supporting victims and holding perpetrators to account. The Programme for Government also commits to the implementation of the strategy.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to publish the Domestic Violence Bill this year. The Bill will improve access to barring orders and provide for greater supports for victims in the court process in areas such as court accompaniment.</p>  <p>  Protecting and supporting victims is a key priority. The proposed legislation to support victims of domestic violence builds on the broader Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill which is being drafted for publication as a priority.</p>  <p>  I am particularly pleased to have secured almost &euro;1m for 2016 to undertake the development and implementation of a national awareness campaign, which will run for six years, in order to change behaviours and attitudes in relation to domestic and sexual violence, and to activate bystanders with the aim of preventing domestic violence. Much progress has been made in advancing this campaign.</p>  <p>  It is my hope that actions being undertaken by my Department and others to tackle the scourge of domestic violence will improve the situation for women and children and remove any barriers to them seeking the support they need.</p></reply>

This prohibition is restated in the International Protection Act 2015 which is expected to be commenced later this year. The key concern in this regard is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system would be undermined by giving immigrants who secure entry to the State, on foot of claims to asylum, the same access to employment as immigrants who follow the lawful route to employment. There is an effective visa and immigration system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes. Any change in public policy with regard to 'right to work' would also have to have regard to the unemployment situation pertaining in the State at any given time. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will, however, be aware that the International Protection Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process. The new procedure will streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will significantly reduce the length of time that persons spend awaiting a decision on their protection application. The commencement of the single procedure and its development to a point where it is operating efficiently will respond to this particular recommendation of the Working Group Report. To be clear, the recommendation in the Working Group did not confer an automatic right to work.  Rather it proposed an enabling provision only in the event that the single protection procedure did not operate as anticipated in relation to processing timescales.  I might add that general policies in relation access to the labour market has been the subject of change in a number of EU Member States in the past number of months with a general tightening of regulations evident. Our policy in this area will be kept under review taking into account all relevant factors.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner, in summary, that there were 53 stations on 30 April 2011 with 607 members assigned to the Galway Garda Division.  On 30 April 2016 there were 43 stations in the Galway Garda Division with<b></b>558<b></b>Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division.<b></b>As the Deputy will understand, there is a significant amount of information available down to station / sub-district level which he has requested.  For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested for the record.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers. Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 5 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Galway Garda Division to date.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.

In that respect I do not see that a unilateral initiative from Ireland would be appropriate in this case, not least given the fact that this is a delicate situation involving the borders between two other Member States. We also need to bear in mind that a defining characteristic of the people in Calais and Dunkirk has been their very strong desire to go to the UK as their ultimate destination and that this is unlikely to change. Persons who are currently in another EU Member State, including those in the camps in Calais and Dunkirk, and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  I share the concerns in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group and expect this issue to remain high on the agenda at EU level.  As regards unaccompanied minors in the State, statutory responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in Ireland rests with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  As I informed the Deputy in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 64 of 17 May, 2016, staff of my Department, including staff working on the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, are in routine ongoing contact with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a range of issues relating to the Relocation Programme.

A necessary first step in preparation for these commencements is the appointment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority after which the Authority will appoint its own Chief Executive. I can confirm that nominations to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been received from the relevant nominating bodies as set out in the Legal Services Regulation Act. The appointment by Government of the relevant nominees under the various criteria set out in the Act will then be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government will appoint one of the lay members of the Authority, which will also have a lay majority, to be Chairperson. Preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment, by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act. A start-up support team is being established and a suitable premises is being identified from which the new Authority can commence its operations.</p>  <p>  These are the initial steps that will enable the members and Chief Executive of the new Regulatory Authority to spear-head the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime. This stage will also include the phased commencement of the Parts of the Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols. Under section 7 of the 2015 Act, I will also, by order, appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.</p>  <p>  Following establishment of the Authority and appointment of a Chief Executive the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced. The managed commencement of these functions is planned for the Autumn in order to allow adequate time and preparation to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework. It should be noted that, under the relevant transitional provisions contained in the 2015 Act, complaints already made to the Law Society under the Solicitors Acts will be brought to completion under that framework and existing law.</p>  <p>  In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million has been made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority. Any funding advanced from this allocation will be provided on a recoupable basis.  As an independent corporate body under statute the new Authority will have the power to manage the conduct of its affairs and its finances. Once in operation, the new regulatory regime will be self-funding by means of a levy on the regulated legal professions. The levy will be applied under the terms set out for that specific purpose in Part 7 of the 2015 Act.</p></reply>

In announcing the Programme, the Government assigned special priority to the plight of unaccompanied children.  However, as has been widely reported, the pace of the relocation programme in Ireland and across the European Union has been hampered by significant operational delays and technical issues due to the sheer numbers involved and other logistical difficulties that have arisen at migration hotspots.</p>  <p>  A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, travelled to Greece earlier this month to meet with Irish embassy officials and relevant Greek authorities both to signal Ireland's tangible willingness to assist and to identify ways of addressing the obstacles that have arisen.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and the Greek authorities have now confirmed that, within the coming months, they will be able to increase significantly the numbers available to Ireland.  In making this commitment, the Greek authorities also signalled that they will be in a position to include small numbers of unaccompanied minors among the groups being allocated.  This will greatly facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to meet the targets foreseen in last September's Government decision and fulfil our commitment to prioritise unaccompanied minors.</p>  <p>  In the wake of these developments, discussions regarding the practical arrangements for taking unaccompanied minors into the State via the relocation mechanism have intensified between senior officials of my Department and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Tusla, which operates under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, has statutory responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State and is represented on the cross-departmental Taskforce established by Government to oversee implementation of the IRPP.  I look forward to their input on this important issue at the next meeting of the Taskforce which takes place on 27th June.</p></reply>

That said, I am aware of the issue to which the Deputy refers in his question and am advised by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) that the particular issue arose from a recommendation made by GSOC to the Garda Commissioner in relation to a particular case.  It follows a report issued by the Law Reform Commission relating to the execution of search warrants and bench warrants which recommended that the Garda&iacute; should adopt a code of practice in relation to search warrants.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there are many factors to be considered in the timing of the execution of a search warrant and it is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to determine in the particular circumstances when it is appropriate to do so.  There will be cases where it is essential that a search warrant is executed without delay, no matter what the time of day or night.  For example, it would be highly undesirable that a search be delayed where there was a genuine fear that the life or well being of any person was in jeopardy.  Equally, the timing of a search may be critical where it is believed that evidence of a criminal act may be lost if there is a delay in conducting a search.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that the timing of searches is a complex issue where a balance must be struck that respects the rights of individuals while ensuring that the criminal justice system can operate to protect citizens and successfully prosecute offenders.</p></reply>

In addition to accepting applications for refugee status from persons who are inside or at the frontiers of the State the Government agreed, in September 2015 to establish the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and to accept up to 4,000 persons overall under the EU Relocation and Resettlement programmes.  This is made up of approximately 2,622 persons to be relocated to Ireland from other EU Member States (Italy and Greece) under the two EU Relocation Decisions which Ireland has opted-in to, and 520 programme refugees which Ireland pledged to resettle under the voluntary EU Resettlement Programme.  The mechanism by which the balance of 858 persons will be admitted has yet to be decided.  These numbers are expected to be further increased by family reunification.</p><p>To date a total of 273 programme refugees have been admitted from Lebanon with the balance of 247 expected to arrive by the end of September, also from Lebanon.  As such, our commitment under the Resettlement programme will be realised in advance of the EU timeframe for implementation.  </p><p>The pace of the Relocation programme across the EU has not progressed as fast as Member States has hoped with just 2,195 having been relocated overall across the participating EU Member States.  This is largely due to operational issues in the setting up of the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece, including the task of persuading migrants and asylum seekers to cooperate with the registration process - a prerequisite to entering the Relocation process.</p><p>The first group of persons relocated to Ireland from Greece, a Syrian family of ten, who arrived in January have been granted refugee status and are receiving our full support to assist them in their integration into Irish society. <b></b>A further group of 31 Syrians are due to arrive this week and an additional 40 persons are provisionally scheduled to arrive towards the end of July. </p><p>A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection programme, travelled to Greece last week to meet with the Greek authorities to see what more Ireland could do to help speed up the process.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and Greece has now committed, within the coming months to significantly increasing the numbers available to Ireland.  This will greatly facilitate Ireland's efforts to meet our targets set by Government last September, within a reasonable timescale.  </p><p>Prior to establishing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, in 2014, Ireland introduced a Syrian Humanitarian Admission Programme (SHAP).  The SHAP offered naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth and Syrian nationals already legally resident in Ireland an opportunity to make an application for vulnerable close family members to join them in Ireland for up to two years under a sponsorship programme.  119 beneficiaries were granted admission under the programme.</p></reply>

To illustrate this point, on 17 June 2016, 3 people or 0.08 percent out of a prison population of 3,795, in custody fell into this category.  On the same date there was no person in prison for the non-payment of debts.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the Fines (Payments and Recovery) Act 2014 I can inform the Deputy that the Act was signed into law by the President on 16 April 2014.  This legislation represents a very significant change in the way justice is administered by the courts.  As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, as the Act provides a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment.  This system has been in operation since January 2016.</p></reply>

This requirement will not, or course, apply in domestic violence cases.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that the Bill will help to reduce recourse to the courts, as well as the costs and delays which may arise in the context of court proceedings.  Moreover, parties wishing to commence legal proceedings in family law cases will be required to attend an information session which will provide more information on mediation options and the advantages associated with mediation as opposed to adversarial, and possibly protracted, court proceedings.  </p>  <p>  The Bill will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of any such proceedings, on its own initiative or at the request of a party to the proceedings, invite the parties to consider mediation as an alternative option and suspend the proceedings to facilitate that process.  While work on drafting the Bill has progressed, I am not in a position at present to provide a publication date but my intention is to publish and proceed with its enactment as soon as possible  .</p></reply>

The role of the Mechanism was to advise me as to what further action, if any it was appropriate for me to take in respect of each complaint.  A panel of independent barristers carried out the review of each case.</p>  <p>  Counsel were free to make any recommendation which they saw fit.  In many cases counsel recommended no further action by me as Minister.  In a number of cases they recommended that I request the Garda S&iacute;ochana Ombudsman Commission to investigate some aspect of the complaints and, having considered those cases and the issues identified by counsel, I did request GSOC, in accordance with section 102 (5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to carry out investigations.  In other cases it was recommended that I seek a report from the Garda Commissioner and, again, having considered the issues, I sought such a report.</p>  <p>  Finally, there were a small number of cases where counsel recommended that an inquiry be carried out into the matters raised in those cases.  In no case did counsel recommend that a Commission of Investigation be established.  In the case referred to in the Deputy's question, counsel recommended a non-statutory inquiry.  I accepted this recommendation and informed the complainants accordingly.  Subsequently, in consultation with the Attorney General on this and the other cases where an inquiry was recommended, I decided that a statutory inquiry under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;ochana Act would be a more effective instrument for such an inquiry.  This fact was communicated to the family on 14 June. </p>  <p>  The advantage of a statutory inquiry under section 42 is that it provides a legislative framework in terms of the powers available to the person appointed to carry out the inquiry.  These include the power to inquire into any aspect of the administration, operation, practice, procedure or conduct of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given the nature of the complaints made by the family of the person referred to by the Deputy as to the Garda investigation of this person's death these powers are particularly appropriate.  Other powers granted to the inquiry include the power to compel any person in possession of information relevant to the inquiry to provide it; and the power to require the attendance of any person before the inquiry.  These powers are supported by statutory recourse to the High Court in certain circumstances.</p>  <p>  I am currently consulting with the Attorney General about the terms of reference for the inquiry and I will be in further contact with the family about the matter.</p></reply>

The Direct Provision system comprises not just full board accommodation but a range of services including health, education and welfare supports.  The principal issue of concern with Direct Provision relates to the period of time in which applicants - many of whom have multiple court appeals - live in the system. </p>  <p>  The previous Government established the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers, chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon, to report to it on this issue.  The Report of the Working Group has implications for a number of Government Departments and services. </p>  <p>  The McMahon Report indicated a two-way approach towards improving the life of persons within the protection process by (i) improving the application process and thereby reducing the length of time spent by applicants in State provided accommodation and (ii) improving the quality of life of those in accommodation through improvements of services within the accommodation system itself but also the supports available through other agencies and bodies.  </p>  <p>  The 173 recommendations in the Report were taken forward by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  To date, a total of 91 have been implemented, a further 49 recommendations have been partially implemented or are in progress, and the balance remain under consideration. </p>  <p>  Just last week I met with those NGOs who participated on the Working Group to bring them up to date on the implementation of those recommendations and I have agreed with them that we would meet on a regular basis with regard to the reforms planned or in process to improve living conditions in centres.</p>  <p>  The International Protection Act 2015 responds to 26 of the Report's recommendations.  The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection which is a key recommendation of the Report.  The single procedure is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing.  I expect that the relevant provisions in the Act will be signed into law later this year.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency is working on solutions in respect of the key improvements in living conditions and catering solutions for families.  There are legal and technical challenges which need to be tackled as part of this work.  Catering solutions are already in place in some centres and a pilot project will be commenced shortly at an additional centre with a view to rolling out that model across centres in the coming months.</p>  <p>  I am also making arrangements for those living in the system to have access to both the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  I should also point out that accommodation centres are subject to regular and frequent inspections by staff of the Reception and Integration Agency and by independent external contractors.  The reports of these inspections are published on the RIA website.  Centres are also subject to inspection by various other State agencies including for example Environmental Health Officers.

The Act provides a statutory framework for the assignment of specific functions for which the Secretary General is responsible to appropriate officers or appropriate grades of officers within departments with accountability flowing to the Secretary General for the performance of those functions.  The Act reaffirmed that, notwithstanding any assignment (i.e. delegation) of functions of civil servants under the Act, a Minister of the Government is in charge of his or her department and is responsible for the administration of that department as provided for in the Constitution and the Ministers and Secretaries Act, thus confirming the primacy of the principle of ministerial responsibility. </p><p>This responsibility, a central element of the structure of Government, ranges from significant political decision making on major policy issues to routine administrative responsibilities discharged by civil servants on my behalf.

In this regard, I have announced a range of measures including legislative proposals to provide additional powers to the Criminal Assets Bureau in targeting the proceeds of crime, an additional allocation of &euro;55 million to be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year in support of targeted measures against crime in its various manifestations, as well as the proposals for accelerated recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Implementation of this programme is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach, and this Committee has taken on a role in overseeing delivery of the reforms recommended by the Inspectorate. </p>  <p>  The implementation of these reforms is clearly supported by the significant investments which have been made in policing resources, under the framework of the Capital Plan 2016-2021, including &euro;205 million for Garda technology and systems.</p>  <p>  The Report rightly acknowledges the dedication and commitment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Applicants for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable then to pay for legal representation.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government states that a more rigorous and objective means testing process for applications for criminal legal aid will be introduced along with increased sanctions for the making of false declarations by applicants.</p>  <p>  Proposals for new Criminal Legal Aid legislation are currently being prepared to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for its administration to the Legal Aid Board.  Key to the better governance of the Scheme will be a provision which will make it mandatory for all applicants for legal aid to complete an application form along with a detailed statement of means.  The proposed measures would include provisions to enable the Board to investigate the means of a person to whom legal aid was granted and, where abuse is detected and it is proven that false or misleading information was provided, such a person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine and or imprisonment.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that this commitment is underlined by very significant investments in Garda resources. </p>  <p>  On June 9 2016 the Garda Commissioner launched a five year programme to professionalise, modernise and renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to ensure that it can meet present and future policing and security challenges.  Important elements of the Garda plan include </p>  <p>  - increased Garda visibility with crime prevention being the number one priority</p>  <p>  - victims being placed at the heart of the Garda service</p>  <p>  - introduction of advanced IT systems introduced to enhance the investigation of crime</p>  <p>  - enhanced collaboration with national and international partners to tackle and disrupt terrorism and organised crime</p>  <p>  The Garda modernisation plan was developed with the benefit of inputs from Garda personnel and community stakeholders, as well as the experience of police forces in other jurisdictions.  The measures in the plan also respond to reports and recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Garda modernisation programme is strongly supported by the range of investments in policing resources which have been put in place.  These investments will facilitate high visibility policing with the provision of high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles.  Provision under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 includes &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  This is in addition to the &euro;34 million that has been invested in the fleet since 2012 with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015. </p>  <p>  In addition, some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the recent additional investment of &euro;55 million in policing resources in 2016 which will make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor, as well as tackling those involved in the recent incidents of violent gang-related crime.</p>  <p>  All Garda activities will also undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme, and in particular the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000.  We are working on measures to accelerate this programme so as to ensure that the Commissioner has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country and into the future.</p>  <p>  Taken together, these investments represent a step-change in the overall provision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and demonstrate the Government's commitment to investing in 21st Century policing so that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p></reply>

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships,  alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  </p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to  ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.   </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not. </p>  <p>  Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  </p>  <p>  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.  </p>  <p>  More recently, in light of the exceptional threat to the safety of the community arising from the recent activities of criminal gangs, I have asked An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department to see whether there are other changes in the law which might be made to address the reality of groups intent on carrying out a sustained series of killings while endangering the safety of communities.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are considerable complexities to this work which require careful consideration.  This examination is ongoing at this time.   </p></reply>

To be of assistance, I have requested the CSO to contact the Deputy directly in relation to the information requested.</p><p>I am advised that Garda management constantly monitor the distribution of policing resources in the light of crime trends and overall policing needs in all areas of the country, including Kildare, with a view to providing an effective and responsive police service.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na implement a number of special targeted strategies, including Operation Thor.  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including the recently announced additional allocation of &euro;55 million in 2016. The additional resources make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime under Operation Thor.</p><p>Furthermore, investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community. The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems. In fact, some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.  </p><p>I can also assure the Deputy that the legislation to tackle crime has been strengthened, and would mention in particular the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support prosecutions arising from the carefully considered Garda strategy to disrupt and oppose criminal activity under Operation Thor.</p><p>More generally, Garda&iacute; continue to support the work of a range of local crime prevention initiatives including the well established network of Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch groups countrywide. Garda&iacute; also participate in more formal consultative structures such as Joint Policing Committees which provide an important mechanism for local Garda management to respond to community concerns. Effective community engagement is particularly evident in the success of the Garda Text Alert scheme which was launched in September 2013. Since then the scheme has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 715 local groups involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month. I am informed that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities as part of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will appreciate that the specific allocation of personnel and other resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, but I am assured that the Garda National Model of Community Policing continues to play a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  This commitment is also very evident in the new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme, which was recently launched by the Commissioner, and as part of which new Community Policing Teams are to be introduced in each Garda District.</p><p>Finally, I might add that policing in Kildare, and in all other areas, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme, and in particular the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000.  We are working on measures to accelerate this programme so as to ensure that the Commissioner has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country and into the future.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p><p>In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and as the policing needs of each individual Division dictates. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that on the 30 April 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 311 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Kildare Garda Division.  The following table gives the detailed breakdown of these members.  The Division is also supported by 29 Garda Reserves and 27 civilians. All Divisional resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU), the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers. Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 25 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Kildare Garda Division to date.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year. We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b></p><p><b>Kildare Garda Division 30 April 2016</b><table><tr><th><font face="Tahoma">District</font></th><th><font face="Tahoma">Station</font></th><th><font face="Tahoma">Garda&iacute;</font></th></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">ATHY                 </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">27</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">CASTLEDERMOT         </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">3</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">KILDARE              </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">34</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">MONASTEREVIN         </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">4</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">NEWBRIDGE            </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">49</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">RATHANGAN            </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">2</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma">KILDARE                 </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma"> TOTAL</font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">119</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">CARBURY              </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">8</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">CELBRIDGE            </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">11</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">KILCOCK              </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">9</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">LEIXLIP              </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">37</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">MAYNOOTH             </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">13</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma">LEIXLIP                </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma"> TOTAL</font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">78</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">CLANE                </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">7</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">KILCULLEN            </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">2</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">NAAS                 </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">102</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">ROBERTSTOWN          </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">3</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma">NAAS                   </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma"> TOTAL</font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">114</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Tahoma"> KILDARE TOTAL</font></td><td><font face="Tahoma"> </font></td><td><font face="Tahoma">311</font></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Ireland has clearly played its part in this regard by sending some of our Naval vessels to the Mediterranean to carry out vital search and rescue missions to ensure the safety of many people trying to come to Europe for protection.  In addition, Irish Aid, the Government's development cooperation programme has been supporting efforts to assist the Syrian people, which by the end of 2015 saw a total of &euro;42 million in support provided with an additional &euro;20 million pledged for 2016.  Ireland has also committed funding to the World Food Programme; some &euro;60 million over the next three years, which is specifically targeted at refugees and in particular Syrian refugees.</p><p>In September 2015, the Government agreed to establish the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and to accept up to 4,000 persons overall under the EU Relocation and Resettlement programmes.  This is made up of approximately 2,622 persons to be relocated to Ireland from other EU Member States (Italy and Greece) under the two EU Relocation Decisions which Ireland has opted-in to, and 520 programme refugees which Ireland pledged to resettle under the voluntary EU Resettlement Programme.  The mechanism by which the balance of 858 persons will be admitted has yet to be decided.  Persons accepted here under these Programmes will also have an entitlement to family reunification, if they wish to do so, thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland. </p><p>To date a total of 273 programme refugees have been admitted from Lebanon with the balance of 247 expected to arrive by the end of September, also from Lebanon.  As such, our commitment under the Resettlement programme will be realised in advance of the EU timeframe for implementation.  </p><p>The pace of the Relocation programme across the EU has not progressed as fast as Member States has hoped with just 2,195 having been relocated overall across the participating EU Member States.  This is largely due to operational issues in the setting up of the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece, including the task of persuading migrants and asylum seekers to cooperate with the registration process - a prerequisite to entering the Relocation process.</p><p>The first group of persons relocated to Ireland from Greece, a Syrian family of ten, who arrived in January have been granted refugee status and are receiving our full support to assist them in their integration into Irish society. <b></b>A further group of 31 Syrians are due to arrive this week and an additional 40 persons are provisionally scheduled to arrive towards the end of July.</p><p>Officials of my Department have been working closely with Greece over the past number of months and staff have also been seconded to the European Asylum Support Office to establish the relocation programme on the ground in Greece.  In addition, officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection programme, travelled to Greece last week to meet with the Greek authorities to progress matters.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and Greece has now committed, within the coming months to significantly increasing the numbers available to Ireland.  This will greatly facilitate Ireland's efforts to meet our targets set by Government last September, within a reasonable timescale.</p><p>Ireland continues to work at EU level on progressing measures to build on existing commitments and platforms, including the Western Balkan Leaders&rsquo; Meeting and the Valletta Summit. Ireland participated in both high-level conferences last autumn and agreed to contribute &euro;3 million to the trust fund for Africa.  In addition, a key element of the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan, which was agreed by Heads of State in November 2015, is the &euro;3 billion fund supporting Syrian refugees in Turkey.  Ireland's contribution to the fund is &euro;22.9 million. </p><p>The migration crisis is a highly challenging issue and is expected to remain a focus of my discussions with my European counterparts in the coming months.  EU Heads of State and Government will also discuss this issue at the forthcoming European Council in June.</p></reply>

Discussions chaired by the Dutch Presidency of the European Council have been ongoing on this issue over the past six months, culminating in a report to last weeks Ecofin Council meeting</p><p><b>Common Backstop</b></p><p>At European level it had previously been agreed that a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) will be in place at the end of the eight year transition period in 2024 and should be fiscally neutral in the medium term. Negotiations on this have yet to commence.</p><p>At the ECOFIN meeting of Finance Ministers on 17 June it was agreed that negotiations on a common backstop should start in September, providing all Member States have finalised the transposition of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.  The Council conclusions also leave open the possibility that the backstop could be introduced ahead of the end of the transition period.  I am strongly in favour of reaching agreement on the back stop as early as possible. </p><p><b>Regulatory Treatment of Sovereign Exposures</b></p><p>The banking and financial services regulatory framework has only recently been changed following the introduction of CRD IV and further changes are impending such as the Leverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio.  In these circumstances I believe we must be cautious in our approach to the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures.  Most importantly, I believe Europe should only act in the context of a global solution to the bank sovereign debt issue.  This issue was also considered at the 17 June Ecofin Council which concluded that Council should await the outcome of the Basel Committee before considering any further steps in the European context.</p><p>It is our view that completing EDIS is an important risk sharing measure.  The Ecofin Council has agreed that work should continue on EDIS at a technical level and move to political level as further progress is made on Banking Union risk reduction measures.</p></reply>

Key among these is the Consumer Protection Code 2012 ('the Code').  The Code, which is a statutory code issued inter alia under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989, sets out many important protections for borrowers in relation to the sale of products (including mortgages), by imposing 'Knowing the Consumer and Suitability' requirements on lenders.  Chapter 5 of the Code contains provisions in terms of how Irish lenders must assess the affordability of credit for an individual borrower, including that the personal and financial circumstances of any consumer applying for credit must be thoroughly assessed to ensure that they are only offered a product that is suitable to their personal circumstances and which they will be able to maintain over the life-time of the product.</p><p>In particular, Provision 5.1 of the Code requires that lenders must gather and record certain information on the consumer, including: </p><p>&quot;a) Needs and objectives including, where relevant:</p><p>i) the length of time for which the consumer wishes to hold a product,</p><p>ii) need for access to funds (including emergency funds),</p><p>iii) need for accumulation of funds. </p><p>b) Personal circumstances including, where relevant: </p><p>i) age,</p><p>ii) health,</p><p>iii) knowledge and experience of financial products, </p><p>iv) dependents, </p><p>v) employment status, </p><p>vi) known future changes to his/her circumstances. </p><p>c) Financial situation including, where relevant:</p><p>i) income, </p><p>ii) savings,</p><p>iii) financial products and other assets, </p><p>iv) debts and financial commitments. </p><p>d) where relevant, attitude to risk, in particular, the importance of capital security to the consumer.</p><p>The regulated entity is only required to seek the information set out at a) to d) above where it is relevant to the assessment of suitability to be carried out under this Chapter.&quot;</p><p>Furthermore, Provision 5.9 specifically requires lenders to carry out an assessment of affordability and consider:</p><p>&quot;a) the information gathered under parts b) and c) of Provision 5.1; and </p><p>b) in the case of all mortgage products provided to personal consumers, the results of a test on the personal consumer's ability to repay the instalments, over the duration of the agreement, on the basis of a 2% interest rate increase, at a minimum, above the interest rate offered to the personal consumer.  This test does not apply to mortgages where the interest rate is fixed for a period of five years or more.&quot;</p><p>It should be noted that where regulated entities are providing credit under credit agreements which fall within the scope of the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 281 of 2010) the Provisions of Chapter 5 of the Code do not apply.  However, these Regulations (which transpose the EU Consumer Credit Directive) separately place an obligation on a creditor to assess the creditworthiness of a consumer borrower before entering into a credit agreement with a consumer borrower (Regulation 11).  In addition, the more recent European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (which transpose the EU Mortgage Credit Directive) also places an obligation on creditors - in relation to residential mortgage and other relevant credit agreements - to assess the creditworthiness of a consumer borrower and furthermore places an onus on a lender to provide credit only where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer's obligations are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement (Regulation 19).  Both Regulations provide that a creditor who contravenes these provisions commits an offence and the Central Bank's Administrative Sanctions powers are also available to enforce these provisions.</p><p>More generally, the Central Bank conducts themed inspections to monitor compliance with all of its codes of conduct (including the Consumer Protection Code) and breaches of regulatory requirements are dealt with using appropriate supervisory powers, including Administrative Sanctions powers, where appropriate.  Furthermore, Central Bank supervision of credit institutions includes an assessment of lending practices and the management of credit risk in the credit institutions' risk appetite and governance frameworks.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold   known as the "Group threshold" below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.  There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer:</p>  <p>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;280,000, increased from &euro;225,000 in Budget 2016, applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p>  <p>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p>  <p>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, applies in all other cases.</p>  <p>  I raised the Group A tax-free threshold applying to gifts and inheritance from parents to their children from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000 in Budget 2016.  This represented an increase of about 25%.  I did this in recognition of the improving state of the public finances and of the concerns expressed to me by people making and receiving gifts and inheritances, particularly in a context of rising property prices.</p>  <p>  I indicated at the time that I saw the change to the Group A tax- free threshold as the start of a process.  The extent to which increases in the various tax-free thresholds for CAT purposes can be accommodated in the future will depend, among other things, on the continuing economic recovery and the competing choices for limited resources.  The Deputy will be aware of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to work with the Oireachtas to raise the Group A CAT tax-free threshold (including all gifts and inheritances from parents to their children) to &euro;500,000.</p></reply>

Over the last five years Revenue has collected almost &euro;430m in interest on behalf of the Exchequer and its determination and effectiveness in this regard is a key component of the overall strategy for securing timely tax compliance and ensuring a level playing field for those that pay their taxes in full and on time.</p>  <p>  I am very satisfied that Revenues long standing approach to interest charging, including the manner in which statistics are captured, is balanced and effective.  The statistical output is designed to fully capture all interest charges that arise on foot of late payment of tax and to omit interest charges where the primary tax charge is written out.  To change the process would require expensive system developments that would be at the cost of other important enhancements and upgrades without providing an appropriate return on investment.</p>  <p>   For the Deputy's information, interest that is correctly charged is only written out in very limited circumstances.  The bulk of such write outs arise in either insolvency situations (Liquidation, Bankruptcy, Examinership and certain Receiverships) or where a taxpayer/business ceases to trade and there are no realisable assets.  To put it in context the amount of tax written out in 2015 was 0.3% of gross collection.</p></reply>

Accordingly, accounts in credit unions that have not been reclaimed by the owners for at least 15 years are not transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act, 1997 (as amended) does not make reference to Dormant Accounts. Dormant accounts in credit unions, and the practices surrounding them, are governed by Rule 22 of the Standard Rules for Credit Unions published by the Irish League of Credit Unions.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by DECLG that an analysis of the benefit of adding dormant credit union accounts to the Dormant Accounts Fund has not been carried out. In practical terms, increasing the amount available in the Fund does not necessarily allow for the introduction of new dormant accounts measures or programmes, which is the focus of DECLG in respect of the Fund. While applying the provisions of the dormant accounts legislation to credit union accounts could increase the size of the Fund, Government Departments must source monies for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocation in the same way as with any other funding programme.  When the monies expended on dormant accounts measures and programmes are reimbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund, the refund is to the Exchequer rather than to the spending Department.  For this reason, dormant accounts expenditure is subject to the same constraints within Departments as any other spending programme.  </p>  <p>  In addition, expenditure on new dormant accounts measures or programmes would serve to increase Government debt levels, as monies disbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund belong to the account holder, who can reclaim it at any time, and not to the State.  Consequently, every euro spent from the Fund is regarded in accounting terms as a potential Government liability.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-22a.285.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062200078#WRK01500"><p>As recognised by the Programme for Government, the Government attaches great importance to addressing the issue of mortgage arrears.  The Government wants to keep families in their homes and avoid repossessions insofar as possible. </p>  <p>  In this context, it is important to note that there are a number of protections already in place to protect borrowers in arrears.  In particular, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. </p>  <p>  The CCMA is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.  </p>  <p>  When it was introduced initially the CCMA contained a six month (later extended to 12 months) moratorium for co-operating borrowers whose mortgage was in arrears (or pre-arrears).  This was revised in 2013 and replaced with a requirement that a lender is required to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose, before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.  Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement or the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.  This gives co-operating borrowers time to consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement. </p>  <p>  The combined effect of these two protections (an eight month protection period and a requirement for three months' notice) is that, for a co-operating borrower, legal proceedings may not commence until three months from the date the letter (setting out one of the above positions) is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later. </p>  <p>  It is important to also note that the commencement of the court process is not a signal that a repossession will occur   it may often be the case that the process then prompts borrowers to re-engage with their bank and to find a solution.  Often these cases are adjourned to allow both parties time to find a sustainable solution.</p>  <p>  Last year the Supreme Court ruled on an issue that arose regarding the extent to which non-compliance with the CCMA could be adjudicated by the Courts in a repossession case between a lender plaintiff and a borrower defendant.  In that regard, the Supreme Court found that the CCMA prohibited lenders from seeking an order for possession where the moratorium was not complied with but that it did not prohibit the seeking of an order for possession in other circumstances. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.   The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory avenue to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.  If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.  Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to,  insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.  Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.</p>  <p>  The numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.  Data released by the Central Bank on 10 June shows that to end-Q1 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last eleven quarters.  Some 120,447 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.  It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that borrower will be able to remain in their family home.  Consequently, I would urge borrowers in this situation to contact the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) who are in a position to provide free and confidential support to borrowers.</p></reply>

My Department also provides July Provision for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.  Where a school chooses not to extend their services for July, eligible children in the school will be granted home based July Provision, on application.</p>  <p>  As the home based provision takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Based July Provision generally reflects that required in a school environment.  Home tutors should be fully qualified teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council of Ireland.</p>  <p>  When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then consideration will be given to the engagement of a tutor who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications) in a relevant area including e.g. psychology.</p>  <p>  The qualification standards for home tutors have not altered.  The requirement that all home tutors be registered with the Teaching Council was introduced in September 2013.</p>  <p>  Parents with any concerns relating to the scheme can contact my officials at 090 64 83858.</p></reply>

Details of the allocations which have been made to schools have now been published on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>Where a school wishes to make an application for SNA support in respect of a child who was not considered as part of this allocation process they may continue to make such applications to the NCSE.</p><p>Where a school wishes to appeal the SNA allocation which has been made to they may do so through the NCSE appeal process, details of which are set out at <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>It should also be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school.</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website.</p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to the allocation of SNA support by the NCSE to an individual child, I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

They provide a mechanism by which developers can contribute to the cost of providing public infrastructure and facilities that benefit development in the area and are expended on public infrastructure defined under the Planning Acts.  These include the provision of open spaces, recreational and community facilities, roads, sewers, waste-water and water treatment facilities, drains and water mains, public transport, schools, school sites, broadband and flood relief works.  The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine (i) the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply and (ii) the expenditure of contributions within the confines of their scheme-conditions.</p><p>Arising from the Government&rsquo;s effort to meet commitments in relation to the general government deficit limit, the local government sector&rsquo;s impact on the General Government Balance (GGB) is currently required to deliver a neutral position each year.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves.  However, within these overall limits, there is additional capacity for new non-mortgage borrowing and the expenditure of capital balances on hand by local authorities, which must be sanctioned by my Department.  In reviewing requests for sanction, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed; that contractual commitments and on-going projects can proceed; and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently.  </p><p>Local authorities are obliged to include data on current and long-term development contribution debtors in their Annual Financial Statements.  As the audited figures for 2015 are not yet available, figures from the audited Annual Financial Statements for 2014 are set out in the following table. </p><p>Current debtors are debts due within a year and are shown before any adjustment for bad debt provisions in the Annual Financial Statements.  Total bad debt provisions for all current debtors are reported within the notes to the Annual Financial Statements but do not separately identify the portion relating to current development contribution debtors.  Long term debtors are debts due in respect of periods greater than one year.  Long-term development contribution debtors are matched in the Annual Financial Statement by deferred income. This acknowledges that the debts of long term debtors are not income in the current period, and are thus deferred to future periods and may or may not become due depending on the progress of the development.</p><p>It should be noted that local authorities operate on an accrual accounting basis and therefore recognise income as earned/billed and not just as cash received.  Audited data in relation to 2015 should be available later this year.</p><p><b>Development Levy Debtors as at 31 December 2014</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Current Development Levy Debtors &euro;*</th><th>Long Term Development Levy Debtors &euro;**</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>2,635,050</td><td>1,764,674</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>547,616</td><td>4,431,773</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>4,910,305</td><td>3,082,563</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>4,453,666</td><td>1,110,023</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>13,328,868</td><td>42,313,089</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>680,346</td><td>5,693,772</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>17,966,035</td><td>15,161,373</td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown</td><td>37,243,585</td><td>36,639,299</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>53,678,246</td><td>5,455,117</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City</td><td>3,400,810</td><td>3,057,605</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County</td><td>2,026,372</td><td>14,104,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>3,403,503</td><td>348,005</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>4,386,298</td><td>9,834,620</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>7,557,569</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>1,162,454</td><td>2,398,644</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>465,252</td><td>1,864,624</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County</td><td>29,645,524</td><td>455,235</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>4,386,035</td><td>191,000</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>9,144,769</td><td>8,057,029</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>10,019,224</td><td>1,005,318</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>21,957,691</td><td>3,728,088</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>923,951</td><td>2,930,895</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>2,822,050</td><td>715,563</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>11,890,138</td><td>853,057</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>405,333</td><td>1,088,239</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td>5,279,763</td><td>12,445,038</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3,150,383</td><td>4,336,748</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County</td><td>1,147,179</td><td>1,208,424</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>3,264,575</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>12,931,180</td><td>5,985,090</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>8,411,476</td><td>2,018,267</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>283,225,246</td><td>192,277,171</td></tr></table></p><p>* Current Development Levy Debtors &ndash; Source: audited local authority Annual Financial Statements 2014, Note 5</p><p>** Long Term Development Levy Debtors - Source: audited local authority Annual Financial Statements 2014, Note 3.</p></reply>

While my Department oversees the contribution of the local government sector to the GGB, the precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.  However, within the overall limits, there is capacity for non-mortgage borrowing and the expenditure of capital balances on hand by local authorities, which must be sanctioned by my Department.  In reviewing requests for sanction, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment, contractual commitments and on-going projects can proceed, and that development contributions can be utilised efficiently.</p>  <p>  With regard to funding announced as part of the Local Infrastructure Fund, I expect that local authorities will continue to avail of loan finance available from the Housing Finance Agency.  However, budgetary matters are a devolved function of local authorities and it will be incumbent on individual authorities to ensure that any new borrowing is matched by appropriate repayment capacity.   </p></reply>

The requirements under Part B represent the national statutory minimum standards of fire safety provision applicable to the construction of new buildings, including dwellings.</p><p>My Department publishes technical guidance documents to assist those involved in the design and construction of buildings with regard to compliance with the Building Regulations.  In the case of fire safety, where works are carried out in accordance with the national guidance provided in Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety (2006), this will, <i>prima facie</i>, indicate compliance with the fire safety requirements set out in the Building Regulations.  It is also open to designers to use alternative approaches, premised on the use of fire safety engineering principles, to meet fire safety requirements provided compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations can be demonstrated. </p><p>Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.Implementation and enforcement of the building control system is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities.</p><p>The Building Regulations are subject to continuous review and improvement in the light of technical progress, changes in standards and construction practices as well as developments within the construction industry.  In this context, a review of Part B of the Building Regulations is now at an advanced stage within my Department; it is anticipated that a public consultation in the matter will be announced shortly.</p><p>In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p><p>Statutory certificates of compliance, where relevant, must be given at commencement (design only) and completion and must be signed by a registered construction professional (i.e. an Architect or a Building Surveyor or a chartered Engineer who is included on a statutory register maintained respectively by the Royal Institution of Architects of Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland or Engineers Ireland).  The statutory certificate of compliance on completion must also be signed by the builder.</p><p>In effect, the statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion certifies that a building is compliant with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations, including the fire safety requirements set out in Part B and the accompanying technical guidance.</p><p>The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 were reviewed following their first 12 months in operation.  It is clear from this review that the recent reforms have brought a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects.  I am confident that as the transition to the new arrangements for the control of building activity continues to progress, these reforms will in time prove capable of transforming the culture of the construction industry in Ireland to one of improved compliance and quality.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-22a.377.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062200081#WRN02800"><p> It should be noted that under the provisions of the Pensions Act persons in civil partnerships, in same sex marriages or in opposite sex marriages are treated equally.  The principle of equal pension treatment is that there shall be no discrimination on any of the discriminatory grounds in respect of any rule of a scheme compared to other members of prospective members of that scheme.  Broadly speaking, pension scheme rules may provide that -</p>  <p>  1. spousal pension benefits will be paid where the member is married at the point of retirement;</p>  <p>  2. spousal pension benefits will be paid where the member is married at the point of death;</p>  <p>  Under 1, where a same sex couple marry subsequent to the member's retirement, no pension would be payable. This also applies to an opposite sex couple, so there would not appear to be a breach of the principle of equal pensions treatment.</p>  <p>  Under 2, where a same sex couple marry subsequent to retirement, but before the member's death, a spousal pension would be payable. This would also be the case for a same sex couple.  Any changes to pension scheme rules would be required to apply equally to persons in civil partnerships, in same sex marriages or in opposite sex marriages.</p>  <p>  Section 81E of the Pensions Act 1990 refers to the forum for seeking redress in relation to equal pension treatment in occupational benefits schemes.  The change requested to the Pensions Act 1990 is intended to extend the period during which a claim for redress may be made to the Equality Tribunal &ndash; now the Workplace Relations Commission &ndash; in respect of certain pension claims.  As section 81E of the Pensions Act currently provides 6 months from the date of termination of employment for the submission of a claim for redress, and scope to extend this to 12 months where there is reasonable cause, I do not intend to bring forward any changes to the legislation at this time. </p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to around 624,000 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure in the order of over &euro;2 billion in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The current arrangements for paying Child Benefit are defined under the provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 with the detailed rules set out in article 159 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) Regulations, 2007. </p>  <p>  The day-to-day needs of the children are the priority consideration in the operation of the current child benefit payment arrangements.  Child Benefit is payable to the person with whom a qualified child normally resides.  The regulations governing normal residence for Child Benefit purposes, provides that a child who is resident with both parents shall be regarded as being normally resident with the mother.  Where the child is living full-time with the father only, then Child Benefit will be payable to the father. </p>  <p>  The scheme does not specifically provide for the payment to the father where the child is also resident with the mother although there are a small number of child benefit claims in payment to the father in situations where the parents live together.</p>  <p>  Legislation was first introduced in 1974 to provide for payment to the mother.  This was seen as a progressive step, the principle of payment to the mother being subordinate to the primary objective that payments had to be for the benefit of the child.  Provision is in place to transfer payment to another individual in certain circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Department regularly reviews all of its schemes, including Child Benefit, in order to ensure that they are still delivering on their original policy aims and objectives and it is my intention to examine this issue.</p></reply>

It was discussed most recently at the Council on Monday, which discussed in particular the current initiative by France to create the conditions for a return to talks.  This began with a conference of Foreign Ministers in Paris on 3 June, in which I participated, at the invitation of France&rsquo;s Foreign Minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault.  I expect the Middle East Peace Process to be discussed again at the July meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  However, no proposal of the nature suggested by the Deputy has been made or discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council.  Successive Ministers have made clear in the House that there is no possibility whatever of obtaining EU consensus in favour of such a move.</p></reply>

As an immediate response to the Gaza crisis, Ireland provided &euro;500,000 in July 2014 to the Emergency Appeal of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to help provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families many of whom had to flee their homes.  At the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference, I pledged a further &euro;2.5 million towards urgent immediate needs and long term recovery efforts.  &euro;2 million of this has been provided to UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeal. During my visit to the Middle East last week, I met with UNRWA&rsquo;s Deputy Commissioner General, Sandra Mitchell, who provided me with a detailed briefing on the very significant progress made in rebuilding UNRWA&rsquo;s educational and medical facilities.  I was pleased to announce, therefore, a further &euro;500,000 for UNRWA&rsquo;s response in Gaza.  This fulfils our pledge of &euro;2.5 million made at the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference in 2014 and brings our total support to the Gaza crisis to &euro;3 million.  </p>  <p>  The World Bank is taking the lead on monitoring pledges made at the Conference and its most recent report of 19 April 2016 indicates that USD1.409 billion has been disbursed, which represents 40% of the funding pledged at the Conference.  I am aware that the current rate of disbursement is less than expected, contributing to a pace of reconstruction much slower than needed.  According to the report, only 9% of totally damaged houses and 45% of partially damaged houses have so far been rebuilt, and 14,800 families continue to be displaced.  While recent indications are that residential reconstruction is picking up momentum, the amount of construction material imported into Gaza continues to be lower than needed. </p>  <p>  Ireland has met its pledge in full in the timeframe specified and I would urge all countries to fulfil their pledges.  It should be recalled, of course, that many of the pledges made, like Ireland&rsquo;s, were to be phased over a period of time.  Many States also made clear that their willingness to donate was linked to progress in discussions to ensure that this type of conflict did not happen again. Unfortunately there has been little progress in this regard.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to press, at EU level and elsewhere, to maintain focus on the humanitarian needs in Gaza and for an end to the blockade on the territory.</p></reply>

However, there are specific additional stresses on Palestinian people resulting from the Israeli control of their land and resources, and the discrimination in favour of Israeli settlers in relation to water as well as other issues. Ireland provides annual funding to a local NGO that provides clean-water services to off-grid communities in the West Bank using environmentally and socially sustainable methods.  To date, the NGO&rsquo;s rural electrification and clean-water services have reached nearly 2000 people in 20 communities in Area C of the West Bank.  In addition to Ireland&rsquo;s annual core support to UNOCHA, we also contribute to the UNOCHA Humanitarian Pooled Fund (HPF) for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, an emergency fund with the aim of supporting the delivery of strategic humanitarian assistance.  Examples of recent projects funded by the HPF are improvement of access and quality in relation to municipal water services in Gaza; improvement to basic sanitation and hygiene services in Gaza; improvement of access to safe, sufficient and affordable water and sanitation facilities for the vulnerable population in Area C. </p>  <p>  Ireland also provides annual support to UNRWA, which provides assistance and protection for Palestinian refugees, including in the West Bank and Gaza.  UNRWA&rsquo;s programmes include work to ensure access to safe drinking water through comprehensive water-supply networks.  It also provides sewerage systems and storm-water drainage to combat the spread of sanitation and hygiene related diseases.  In addition to providing funding to UNRWA&rsquo;s General Fund, Ireland also supports UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeal.</p>  <p>  The EU has provided humanitarian funding of EUR25 million to the Occupied Palestinian Territory in 2015 through ECHO.  In Gaza, ECHO funds humanitarian projects including those that deal with water and sanitation. </p>  <p>  Last week the EU agreed to provide &euro;10 million in funding to UNICEF for stage two of the Gaza small scale desalination plant, following &euro;10 million already provided for stage one. Stage two is to begin construction in the next few weeks, and will produce 12,000 cubic metres of safe drinking water each day.</p>  <p>  Other EU partners are also engaged in specific projects, for instance Germany has been engaged on building new sewage treatment works in Gaza.</p>  <p>  In addition to these efforts directly related to water issues, Ireland and our EU partners continue to work politically for an end to the occupation and the expansion of settlements which are the root cause of many of these problems.</p></reply>

I raised the issue of settlements last week with the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, who is also Israel&rsquo;s Foreign Minister.  Settlements also featured in my discussions with the Palestinian Foreign Minister, Riad Malki, and with the Secretary General of the Arab League, Mr. Nabil Al Araby.  Settlement expansion acts to make more difficult and, possibly, ultimately close off the possibility of a peace agreement, and contributes significantly to the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>The European Union continues to work to distinguish its relations with Israel itself from any with settlements.</p><p>The principal measure in place is that goods from settlements, both produce and manufactured goods, are not eligible for the reduced tariffs on entry to the EU which apply to goods from Israel and most other countries.

Through the Irish Aid programme, we currently provide some &euro;10 million annually in development and humanitarian assistance.  This involves support to the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees and civil society organisations working to promote human rights.  To date in 2016, I have approved funding totalling &euro;6 million for the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA.  Ireland, like other EU Members States, is committed to supporting the Palestinian Authority as part of our overall programme of support for the Palestinian people.  This support which enables the Palestinian Authority to build its institutions and provide essential public services to its people is critical to laying the foundations for a future Palestinian State. Ireland&rsquo;s funding to the Palestinian people has traditionally had a strong focus on the education sector which is crucial to Palestine&rsquo;s long-term economic viability.  I recently approved &euro;1.5 million in support to the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s Education Development Strategic Plan, which will be channelled through a joint donor fund in the education sector.<i></i>Ireland&rsquo;s contribution will help support the Palestinian Authority in delivering its education services and ensuring improved access to and quality of education for Palestinian children.While we work to ensure that Palestinian institutions are ready for statehood, we continue to have to address the immediate humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people.  The humanitarian situation continues to be precarious as the key drivers of vulnerability remain in place.  The protracted crisis is compounded by recurrent escalations in hostilities, such as the conflict in Gaza in 2014, which increase humanitarian needs. </p><p>Ireland has been a longstanding supporter of UNRWA&rsquo;s vital work in delivering humanitarian and development assistance to Palestine refugees.<i></i>During my visit to the Middle East last week, I announced funding of &euro;4.5 million for UNRWA; &euro;4 million for UNRWA&rsquo;s General Fund to support the Agency in delivering core services, especially in education and health to some 5 million Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and &euro;500,000 for UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeal to help meet urgent humanitarian needs.</p><p>Ireland will continue to actively support the search for a lasting and peaceful political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  In the meantime, we will continue to offer the humanitarian support which is essential in addressing the ongoing basic and emergency needs of the Palestinian people.</p><p>My Department also contributed &euro;58,000 this year supporting visits to Ireland by groups of Israelis and Palestinians who wish to share and draw from the experiences of participants in the Irish peace process.  This is a developing area of support I hope to continue.</p></reply>

It is open to the Council to undertake any appropriate and viable local flood mitigation works using its own resources.  The focus of the Office of Public Works' (OPW) funding support is for works related to fluvial (river) flooding.  Flooding caused by significant pluvial events i.e. intensive rainfall over a short period usually in a relatively small geographic area and where the surface water drainage systems cannot cope with the volume of water are the responsibility of the local authority.  Having regard to the foregoing, the local authority can submit an application for funding if appropriate under the Office of Public Works (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  Any application received will be assessed under the scheme's eligibility criteria which includes a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.

Against this background, the Government set out Departmental allocations for Oireachtas approval based on ensuring that fiscal targets were met while Departments continued to deliver key services at a time of increased demand.</p>  <p>  The backdrop to additional spending provided by way of Supplementary Estimate in 2015 was that, with tax revenues well over forecast, the deficit target for 2015 could be achieved while additional expenditure could be accommodated.  This represented a responsible approach towards funding of public services to meet social and economic objectives both in 2015 and in 2016.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, managing the delivery of public services within Budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department, and important measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets continue to be met.  My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.  There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  The end-May Exchequer returns show that most Departments continue to manage expenditure within profile.  However, certain pressures are evident, in particular in the Health sector.  As outlined in the April Stability Programme Update, there is now scope to accommodate additional expenditure increases in 2016 while continuing to deliver against the key fiscal targets.  In this context, the Government has decided to allow for targeted increases to support the delivery of key services in the Health Sector and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These increases are reflected in the 2016 Estimates currently being considered by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Estimates, therefore, fully reflect the Government's assessment at this time of the public expenditure resources to be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann required to provide the public services funded from each Vote.</p></reply>

This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more for health insurance than the young and healthy.  Lifetime Community Rating came into effect on 1 May 2015 and is designed to encourage people to join the private health insurance market at an earlier age and thus support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance.</p>  <p>  Late entry loadings of 2% per annum now apply for people who buy health insurance for the first time at the age of 35 and older.  Previous periods of health insurance cover are taken into account in calculating the loading that may apply to individuals, whereby the level of loading will be reduced by the relevant credited period(s).  These credited periods apply for periods of health insurance cover with registered health insurers in this country, taking account of our system of community-rated health insurance.</p>  <p>  Periods of cover on health insurance plans held outside the State (including Northern Ireland) will not be taken into account when calculating loadings, as such plans do not comply with private health insurance legislation in Ireland or conform with the key principles of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and minimum benefit on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based.  Insurance systems are not directly comparable or related.  For example in other health insurance systems the level of risk that an individual presents can directly affect the premium paid, so periods of cover or time served are not directly interchangeable between the different insurance markets that exist.</p></reply>

This is despite a background of increasing demands on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services overall.  There are a number of reasons why such admissions are made.  These include distance from a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services facility, timing of admissions, potential medical issues, potential substance misuse, family concerns and the overall safety of the young person, their family and other service users.  The HSE monitors this situation closely with a view to limiting inappropriate admissions as much as possible. </p>  <p>  It is the policy of the HSE to provide an age appropriate service, with a significant majority of young people now being treated by a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Teams.  There have been some difficulties in recruiting and retaining Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services staff, particularly Consultant Psychiatrists.  This deficit has caused some difficulty in delivering an age appropriate service in some parts of the country, but the Executive continues to address the issue in the context of expanding both community based, and age appropriate residential care, for those under age 18.</p></reply>

The operational services and procedures for Child and Adolescent Mental Health are applied to all referrals up to 18 years of age.  There have been some difficulties in recruiting and retaining Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services staff, particularly consultant psychiatrists.  Due to these operational, staff recruitment and retention challenges at local level, a number of referrals in the 16-18 year age group are dealt with by local Adult Teams under the appropriate CAMHS procedures.  The Executive is addressing this issue on an on-going basis.   </p>  <p>  There are 67 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Teams and extra services for special service needs have also been introduced in recent years.  The HSE is committed to addressing the service needs of the 16-18 age cohort by expanding the staffing and range of CAMHS team coverage on an ongoing basis, supported by prioritisation of funding from the additional mental health funding allocation in 2016 as outlined in the HSE Mental Health Operational Plan 2016.</p>  <p>  Along with expansion of CAMHS team services, the Plan provides for improved collaboration between the Mental Health and Primary Care Divisions in the development of Early Intervention and Counselling services specifically for young people under 18 years of age.  Additional funding has also been provided for expansion of Jigsaw Services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, to complement the existing services funded by the HSE. </p></reply>

This is reflected in the Programme for Government and the Energy White Paper. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to: </p>  <p>  - providing support for community-led projects in the initial stages of development, planning and construction; and </p>  <p>  - establishing a register of community benefit payments, and examining shared-ownership opportunities for renewable energy projects in local communities supporting, in particular, the emerging energy co-operative movement as one means of facilitating community participation. </p>  <p>  - These commitments reflect the extensive range of actions set out in the Energy White Paper published last December. I would in particular draw the Deputy's attention to Chapter 4 of the Energy White Paper and the enabling actions for widening the opportunity for community participation,  set out therein, which also include: </p>  <p>  - supporting community participation in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, via the SEAI, to share best practice, provide information and ensure that local strategies align with broader Government policy;</p>  <p>  - facilitating access to the national grid for designated renewable electricity projects, and developing mechanisms to allow communities to avail of payment for electricity, such as the ability to participate in power purchase agreements;</p>  <p>  - providing funding and supports for community-led projects in the initial stages of development, planning and construction. These will be defined using criteria such as scheme size and degree of community ownership; providing a new support scheme for renewable electricity which will be available from 2016; </p>  <p>  - developing a framework for how communities can share in the benefits of substantial new energy infrastructure which is located in their area; </p>  <p>  - exploring the scope to provide market support for micro generation. This will be informed by an SEAI analysis of the potential of technologies in the field of small-scale wind, solar, micro-CHP and small-scale hydro;</p>  <p>  - engage with local government on advising consumers on energy efficiency initiatives and clean energy options, integrating energy options, scoping the opportunities for demand and supply related local energy action through integrating energy issues into local area planning, and bringing stakeholders together to find locally appropriate solutions that bridge the gap between demand and supply (e.g. biomass fuel, district heating solutions).</p>  <p>  Several of the actions are already being implemented and the remaining actions will be taken forward as part of the process of implementing the White Paper and Programme for Government commitments. </p>  <p>  Many communities are interested in being involved in the energy transition as evidenced by the participation in SEAI&rsquo;s Better Energy Communities and Sustainable Energy Communities programmes. Already, more than 12,000 homes and hundreds of shared community facilities have been upgraded through this programme. I hope to make an announcement on the successful applicants to the 2016 programme shortly.</p>  <p>  National policy also sets out the need for project-based supports. The development of the Renewable Electricity Planning and Development Framework (due later this year) will include a framework for communities to share in the benefits of new energy infrastructure and examine shared-ownership opportunities for renewable energy projects in their local area. </p>  <p>  In terms of grid connection policy, I note that the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s recent consultation specifically requested responses to outline what issues should be taken into consideration regarding community based scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, which meet the defined eligibility criteria.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  The homes of the scheme beneficiaries are retrofitted free of charge, thus making those homes more energy efficient.  The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation.  Since the scheme commenced in 2000, 123,174 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;161.75m. &euro;16.5m has been allocated to the scheme for 2016. </p><p>Applications for the scheme are dealt with on a first come, first served basis.  Once an application is made, contractors operating on behalf of SEAI survey the home to determine what measures are most suitable for that home.  Once a survey has been completed, homes are issued to SEAI&rsquo;s panel of appointed contractors and works typically proceed within a matter of days.  The average waiting time from application to service delivery is 92 days, with the longest waiting period being six months.  Demand for the scheme remains strong, clearly demonstrating its potential to continue to deliver energy efficiency gains and related benefits, such as reduced energy costs and better health outcomes. </p><p>The following table illustrates the number of homes completed in the last five years of the scheme's operation, along with the number of homes completed in the previous ten years of the scheme and the number of homes completed so far in 2016. <table><tr><th>Better Energy Warmer Homes  </th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pre-2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016 ytd</td></tr><tr><td>Total Number of Homes Completed</td><td>61,412</td><td>20,388</td><td>12,175</td><td>9,803</td><td>9,056</td><td>6,867</td><td>3,473</td></tr><tr><td>Value of grants paid &euro;</td><td>56,700,000</td><td>21,400,000</td><td>20,500,000</td><td>17,553,156</td><td>20,655,606</td><td>18,136,198</td><td>6,800,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy will note that the average spend per home has increased considerably over the lifetime of the scheme.  This is attributable to significant improvements in the building regulations, particularly with regard to draught proofing, that SEAI appointed contractors must meet and an increase in the average depth of renovation per home.  Increasing the number of measures the typical home receives adds to the cost of the programme but delivers more energy savings and warmer, more comfortable homes to scheme beneficiaries. </p><p>SEAI has also been piloting a limited number of deeper interventions to homes that cannot be treated by some of the typical measures.  These cannot be applied for but rather are chosen by SEAI from the pool of existing applicants based on a needs based assessment of the home.  SEAI&rsquo;s surveyors have strict guidelines to follow and the clients identified are those who are at the extreme end of fuel poverty and deprivation.  Piloting deeper interventions through the Warmer Homes scheme is necessary to deliver learnings on the impact such interventions can have on those in energy poverty and also to ensure that the skills needed for such works are developed in the Irish construction sector.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law. Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case. </p>  <p>  The recent WRC decision regarding an individual working as an Au Pair does not constitute any change to existing employment law and any persons working under a contract of employment must continue to have the full protection of employment law.  I have no plans to review the status of au pairs with a view to deeming persons determined to be employees to be outside the scope of employment law.  My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area is primarily concerned with ensuring that those people found to be employees can enforce their rights, as provided for under employment rights legislation.     </p>  <p>  Finally, under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, certain reckonable components may be taken into account for all workers to determine an employee&rsquo;s average hourly rate.  In this context, if an employer provides an employee with full board and lodgings, or lodgings only or full board only, a monetary allowance can be included as reckonable pay (the term &lsquo;full board&rsquo; means an entitlement to meals during the day) as follows:</p>  <p>  - &euro;54.13 for board and lodgings per week, or &euro;7.73 per day;</p>  <p>  - &euro;32.14 for board only per week, or &euro;4.60 per day;</p>  <p>  - &euro;21.85 for lodgings only per week, or &euro;3.14 per day.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of this provision in the National Minimum Wage legislation was recommended by the Inter-Departmental Group on Implementation of a National Minimum Wage.  It was the view of the Inter-Departmental Group that the monetary value of the allowances for the purpose of the National Minimum Wage would not be set at market value but rather would be similar to the amount provided for in Employment Regulation Orders. </p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (National Minimum Hourly Rate of Pay) Order 2000 (SI No. 95/2000) provided for the amounts specified.  There are currently no plans to make changes to these provisions.  However, I am very conscious of the passage of time since these rates were set and I will keep this in mind in my consideration of this issue.</p></reply>

Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations. </p>  <p>  As it stands, where changes to pension schemes are negotiated at company level, whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise, the outcome of that engagement cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme.  Rather, any proposed changes to the scheme are effected through the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules/deeds of the scheme.  In my view, it is within this framework, rather than through the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery, that a collective approach would be most effective.</p>  <p>  In terms of changes to pension schemes generally, the trustees of a particular pension scheme are required by law to act in the best interests of all the members, be they active, deferred or pensioner members.  Until recently, this has been done on an individual basis.</p>  <p>  Section 50 of the Pensions Act was revised last year to provide for the recognition by trustees and the Pensions Authority of groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members of a particular pension scheme.  The required revised section 50 guidance has been published by the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  Trustees of a pension scheme are now required to notify the groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members where the trustees of a scheme propose to apply to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act.  This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such proposals. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Pensions Authority is now required to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members where the Pensions Authority proposes to either issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B of the Pensions Act.  This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make representations to the Pensions Authority in relation to such proposals.</p></reply>

On average, from September 2016, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the current provision of 38 weeks.</p>  <p>  With regard to payment for non-attendance of children availing of the ECCE Programme, the Programme contains provision for payment to continue in instances where the child is absent for periods of 4 consecutive weeks or less.  It is only in instances where a child is absent for a period of more than 4 consecutive weeks that the pre-school provider is obliged to cease claiming payment.  If the child subsequently returns to the service, payment will be re-instated.</p>  <p>  In a case where a child is absent for a week a service provider should make enquiries into the matter with the Parent or guardian.  If a child misses 4 weeks (20 consecutive days), a Leaver Form must be submitted by the service provider on the a Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP).  The service provider must complete the PIP Leaver Form up to a maximum of 4 payment weeks after the week the child last attended.  The child will be removed from the programme and ECCE funding for the child will not continue after this point.  The service will receive ECCE funding for the 4 week period between the child&rsquo;s last date of attendance and the submission of the PIP Leaver Form.</p>  <p>  If there is good reason for absence beyond 4 weeks a service provider must contact their local City and county Childcare Committee (CCC) in writing to seek authorisation not to submit a PIP Leaver Form.

These requirements will be fully introduced in 2016 following the publication of new Childcare Regulations. The level 5 requirement will come into effect as of 30 June 2016 for newly-registering services and for existing services on 31 December 2016.  As of 31 December 2016, staff members must hold a level 6 qualification to be permitted to work as ECCE room leaders.</p>  <p>  Following the introduction of these changes only those staff who hold the necessary qualification will be in position to meet the ratio requirements in early years settings.</p>  <p>  The Community Employment programme is administered by the Department of Social Protection.  This programme is a labour market activation measure designed to help people who are long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged people to get back to work by offering part-time and temporary placements in jobs based within local communities. </p>  <p>  The Community Employment Childcare Programme is a three year programme which also includes upskilling participants to qualify for a Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in Early Childhood Care and Education.  After placement, participants are encouraged to seek part-time and full-time jobs elsewhere based on the experience and new skills they have gained while in a Community Employment programme. </p>  <p>  CE workers potentially form part of the adult:child ratios in some community childcare facilities.  The new qualification requirement will mean that such workers will no longer be permitted to count towards the required adult:child ratio unless they hold the required minimum qualification.  </p>  <p>  At the request of this Department, the City and County Childcare Committees have established a project to examine the impact of these changes on the sustainability of community childcare services that are currently dependent on CE workers to meet the ratio requirements.  </p>  <p>  This Department has advised childcare providers who consider that the sustainability of their service is at risk as a result of this measure to contact their local City or County Childcare Committee immediately to discuss this matter.</p>  <p>  There is a possibility that Community Childcare Services may not wish to participate in the CE programme if they do not benefit from it.  DCYA have highlighted to DSP that they may wish to consider other incentives for engaging with the programme. </p>  <p>  To support staff to meet the new qualification requirements, my Department established the Learner Fund which has already allocated &euro;3.5 million to over 3,000 staff for the purpose of up-skilling.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;1.5 million was allocated for Learner Fund 4 in Budget 2016.  This will be allocated to 1,000 early years practitioners to undertake and complete the Level 6 qualification, which is a requirement for pre-school leaders.</p></reply>

The promotional instruments for the relevant personnel were signed on 16 June 2016 and Department officials are now processing same.  Within the available resources in the Defence Vote, there is no requirement to generate payroll savings so there is no basis to suggest there was an attempt to do so.  As already announced, targeted recruitment will continue in 2016 so as to maintain the level of 9,500 personnel.  It is my intention that promotions, along with targeted recruitment, will continue to be carried out within the resource envelope allocated to Defence.</p></reply>
