That change should ensure a joined up approach to the needs of children in care.</p><p>  It is also because of cases such as this one that I, in the draft Admissions to Schools Bill 2013 currently under consideration by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, am providing a power for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school place, and that schools must comply with that designation. This new power if enacted, can clearly provide a remedy for any child out of school, including children in care.</p></reply>

Accordingly, an independent review of this service is currently being conducted line with the NCSE recommendations.</p><p>  The review is being conducted by two independent reviewers who are tasked with reviewing the role and function of the Visiting Teacher Service in accordance with the Terms of Reference of the Review which are available on my Department's website, with a view to the making recommendations for consideration to my Department. </p><p>  I am not in a position to anticipate the outcome of this review which is still underway and which is expected to be concluded by the middle of March 2014.</p></reply>

These recommendations were drawn up following a public consultation process and widespread engagement with interested parties.</p><p>  As part of my Action Plan in response to the Report, I recently conducted a further consultation process to give parents, in particular, an opportunity to give their views on the Group's recommendations on how schools can become more inclusive.</p><p>  The process to date has given ample opportunity for the views of all interested parties to be taken on board.  In accordance with the Programme for Government commitment, the submissions received, together with the Forum Report findings and recommendations, are now being considered with a view to developing a White Paper outlining Government policy in this area.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS will cease making this payment to the Institutes of Technology and apprentices themselves will pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.</p><p>  The charge is &euro;833 for the vast majority of apprentices scheduled on an off the job phase in an Institute of Technology in the academic year 2013/14, but is more than this for a small number of apprentices attending phases that are longer than the typical 10-11 weeks.</p><p>  Apprentices will pay the same contribution as students, apportioned for the time they spend in the Institutes.  Unlike students, apprentices are paid a training allowances by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in Institutes of Technology. This allowance is equivalent to the wages they receive from their employers for on the job phases and is unaffected by the budgetary changes. Although apprentices are not eligible to receive student grants, the value of their training allowance would be greater than the maintenance available under the student grant scheme.</p><p>  This decision was taken against a difficult budgetary background and there is no scope to re-visit it.</p></reply>

In fact more than one third of schools provide more than that. However, I am aware that inspections have shown that a minority of schools are not meeting the minimum requirement.My Department is planning a detailed analysis of the instruction time at schools.  This will involve specific assessment of practice across schools of different types and sizes. The analysis will look at the needs of students and objectives that schools are trying to meet when they deviate from the standard 28 hours or identify the factors that give rise to deviation from the standard.  The research work will relate to the decisions schools make when deciding how to use the aggregate teaching hours available from the schools allocation.</p><p>  The outcome of this work will help determine future policy.</p></reply>

I intend to commence Part 5 later this year. Government approval was given on 10th December for drafting The Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill to provide for a wider range of sanctions such as advice, admonishment and censure, which may be applied by the Council following an inquiry.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that procedures were introduced in 2009 under the Education Act (Section 24) for schools and Education and Training Boards (then VECs), as employers, to address teacher competence issues.

Input from enterprise is also provided for through representation on boards and agencies across the education and training sector.  The development and delivery of targeted skills initiatives such as the ICT Skills Action Plan and Springboard involve close interaction with enterprise.  In addition, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which is funded by my Department, plays a pivotal role in advising on the skills needs of enterprise and its research and reports inform programme development by education and training providers.</p><p>  Meeting the requirements of industry is a high priority for the education system and a wide ranging programme of reform is currently being rolled out across all levels of the system to ensure the continued development of skills appropriate to enterprise, particularly through the implementation of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and the reform of the Junior Cycle.  One of the core objectives under the new Performance Framework for the higher education system is meeting Ireland's human capital needs across the spectrum of skills areas through both core funding and specifically targeted initiatives.  The creation of the new further education and training authority, SOLAS, will also ensure an increased focus on the evolving skills requirements of industry.</p></reply>

The Committee can consult with citizens with expertise in the area, civic society groups and other interested groups &ndash; crucially, this will take place before the Legislation is drafted.</p><p>  - Where there has been Pre-Legislative Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee will have an equal right to speak as the Minister and the Opposition spokespersons before the D&aacute;il to outline the Committee's work.</p><p><b>Post Legislative Review</b></p><p>  - A Minister will report to the relevant Oireachtas Select Committee within 12 months of enactment to review the functioning of the Act. This will allow for the Committee to consult with civil society groups and individuals with expertise in the relevant area.</p><p><b>Enhancing the role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget Process</b></p><p><i>April to September</i></p><p>  - In April each year the Stability Programme Update is presented by the Government to the EU. Committees can review this information and report before the Budget in October.</p><p><i>October to December</i></p><p>  -  The Budget and Spending Estimates will be published earlier than in the past.</p><p>  - The D&aacute;il and Committees will now scrutinise the Budget proposals and the Estimates earlier than in the past.</p><p>  In September 2013 the Government also outlined a new Committee structure to operate under a unicameral parliamentary system if the referendum to abolish the Seanad was passed. This Committee structure would consist of 14 D&aacute;il Committees including four strategic committees, seven sectoral committees and three thematic committees with Committee Chairs appointed under the d&rsquo;Hondt system.</p><p>  The referendum result maintains the bicameral system and the proposed changes to the Committee structure are now under review to identify those reforms that can operate under a bicameral system. </p><p>  Work is already underway on the next, and third, phase of Oireachtas Reform which will include further reform of the Oireachtas Committee structure. </p><p>  Changes to the Oireachtas Committee structure have already required amendments to the D&aacute;il Standing Orders and further reforms of these structures will also require amendments to the Standing Orders.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-21a.158.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012100059#WRD00500"><p>The tragic and unrelenting crisis in Syria has resulted in unprecedented levels of humanitarian need, requiring a sustained response from the international community. As the number of fatalities rises towards 130,000, there are now over 9.3 million people who are in need of immediate life-saving support. In addition to more than 6.5 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are currently 2.3 million Syrians who have fled to neighbouring countries. </p><p>  The Palestinian refugee population is of increasing concern to the international humanitarian community. Prior to the conflict, the 500,000 Palestinian refugees in Syria were already poorer and more vulnerable than the general population. While they were originally spared the excesses of the violence, their communities have been increasingly affected by the violence, and are often directly targeted. Increasing numbers of Palestinian refugees are fleeing to neighbouring countries to escape the violence but those that are left behind are at risk.</p><p>  I am deeply concerned about the plight of Palestinian refugees in Yarmouk refugee camp just outside of Damascus. UN agencies, including UNRWA, have been unable to access the camp due to fighting in this besieged part of Syria. I was alarmed to learn that UNRWA convoys carrying essential food and medical supplies had to withdraw from Yarmouk recently because of hostilities. Over the past year I have used every opportunity at the international level to call upon all sides of the conflict to ensure that relief organisations can deliver life-saving assistance to those under siege.</p><p>  Ireland will continue to call for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort, both within the EU and the United Nations. Our overarching priority remains achieving an end to this appalling conflict and the horrific loss of life and mass violations of human rights which are its principal result. I am working with my colleagues through the EU and at the UN to support the Geneva II framework, which remains the best option for a negotiated end to the conflict.</p><p>  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the ten most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. Last week I attended a Pledging Conference on Syria, kindly hosted by the Government of Kuwait, at which I announced a pledge of &euro;12 million towards the humanitarian response in Syria and neighbouring countries. With this pledge, Ireland will have committed more than &euro;26 million in assistance to respond to the crisis through a range of established UN partners, the Red Cross and Irish and international NGOs. This humanitarian aid has been targeted at both Syrians and Palestinian refugees affected by the crisis within the country and in neighbouring countries.</p><p>  Ireland is a longstanding supporter of UNRWA (the UN agency dedicated to responding to the needs of Palestinian refugees). As well as providing &euro;4 million in core funding to the agency on an annual basis, we have specifically provided &euro;1,200,000 to UNRWA for its humanitarian response to Palestinian refugees directly affected by the Syria crisis. We will continue our support to UNRWA in 2014.</p></reply>

When the case came to the attention of my Department, the Ambassador accredited to Pakistan at the time called upon the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad to convey our concern at the conviction and sentence.  He also expressed our disquiet at the nature of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy law.  Officials in my Department keep in regular contact with the Embassy of Pakistan on this and a number of other issues.</p><p>  At European level, freedom of religious belief and expression plays a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.  The High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, Catherine Ashton has expressed her concerns at the Bibi judgment, and others like it, numerous times and called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions.</p><p>  During a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in March 2013, Ireland together with our EU partners urged the authorities in Pakistan to take the necessary action to protect the rights of all citizens, including those belonging to religious minorities.</p><p>  Pakistan underwent a &lsquo;Universal Periodic Review&rsquo; of the human rights situation in the country at the United Nations in October 2012.  At this review, concern was expressed about the case of Mrs. Bibi and calls for Pakistan to consider adopting an official moratorium on the death penalty.  During the process, Ireland recommended that Pakistan take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against religious and other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.</p><p>  Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief.  We are well aware of the vulnerable situation of persons belonging to religious minorities in Pakistan and will continue to raise the case of Asia Bibi and others bilaterally with the Pakistan Government as well as through the framework and mechanisms of the European Union and the United Nations.</p></reply>

The role of the ETC is to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade, tourism and investment, and to oversee the progressive implementation of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. Other Members of the Council include Minister Bruton, Minister Varadkar, Minister Coveney and Minister of State Costello. Other relevant Departments are represented at senior official level, while the CEOs of Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, SFI and Tourism Ireland are also members. In addition, the private sector is represented on the Council through representatives of IBEC and the IEA, as well as through the participation of a number of individuals from the private sector with a track record in the relevant sectors.</p><p>  The ETC also oversees the work of Local Market Teams, which have been established in Ireland&rsquo;s 27 priority markets. These Teams are chaired by our Ambassadors on the ground and consist of representatives of the Embassy and the State agencies. Each Team is responsible for developing an annual Local Market Plan and the implementation of these plans is reviewed by the ETC.</p><p>  A key task for my Department in the last year has been to coordinate a review of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. The Review is designed to ensure that the State coordinates its efforts overseas in a manner which yields the best possible economic return and I look forward to presenting it in the coming weeks.</p><p>  Given the already high level of coordination facilitated by the ETC and Local Market Team structures, the appointment of a &ldquo;Trade Czar&rdquo; is not under consideration at this time.</p></reply>

This scheme came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015. The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.</p><p>  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (inclusive of VAT).  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out. Any unused credit will be carried forward to future years.</p><p>  It is worth noting that the minimum threshold does not have to be reached by each contractor where a homeowner engages a number of contractors to carry out different works.  So long as the aggregate payments reach the minimum threshold of &euro;5,000 inclusive of VAT, the homeowner will qualify for relief.</p><p>   The scheme will be administered through Revenue s online systems. Contractors will be required to inform Revenue in advance of details of works to be carried out and will also be required to notify Revenue in relation to any payments received in respect of the works. Homeowners will be able to view the information provided to Revenue by the contractor through the Revenue electronic systems and will also claim the relief through those systems.</p><p>  Full details of the scheme are available on the Revenue website at  along with a newly produced  Guide for Homeowners. Copies of the Guide are being distributed to all local Revenue Offices and Citizens Advice centres.</p></reply>

The group also considered that it was for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the time span for phasing-in deductibility and what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes.</p><p>  The Government accepted the recommendation of the Thornhill Group in principle, but has not yet considered the manner or the timing in which this will happen. Any such change would have to be provided for by primary legislation. Allowing LPT as a deductible expense will reduce the tax base. Therefore I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer, given the significant budgetary constraints.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under existing legislation income tax is charged under Schedule D of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of a number of sources of income, which are classified into five separate Cases. Under this provision, rent received by landlords (both individuals and companies) from property in the State is chargeable to tax under Case V, while income from trading activity in the State is chargeable under Case I.</p><p>  In the case of trading activity, the law provides that taxable income is closely aligned to the accounting profit (subject to certain explicit prohibitions). In the case of rental activity, however, taxable income is the gross rent as reduced by a limited number of specified deductions as set out in section 97 (2) TCA 1997. These are:</p><p>  - any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>  - the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>  - the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property</p><p>  - the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and </p><p>  - payment of local authority rates.</p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.</p></reply>

These are statutory codes with which lenders are required to comply.   In particular, the sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on a mortgage secured on a primary home and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their co-operating borrowers in mortgage difficulty.</p></reply>

The Central Bank of Ireland does not approve products offered by regulated entities and does not collect data on product availability in other Member States.  Regarding the issue of inter-generational mortgages, the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group Report, 2011, indicated that research showed that country specific factors are very important and that the product would likely encounter serious legal difficulties in Ireland.  However, regarding those existing mortgages in difficulty, the Report suggested that a split mortgage, which may contain a residual balance, at the end of the mortgage term, was one possible approach that a lender may take to address such a difficult situation.</p></reply>

It would appear the Deputy is proposing that, notwithstanding that expenditure met that test, a deduction would not be permitted unless an invoice carried either a VAT or a tax reference number.</p><p>  The Irish economy is one of the most open economies in the world and significant amounts of services and goods are both acquired and sold cross border. In many instances there can be no requirement that the foreign provider must register for tax in this State. The proposal would therefore require a further administrative burden be placed on Irish businesses over businesses carried on outside the State by requiring those businesses to amend their records to incorporate this proposal. In order to prevent abuse there may also be a need or requirement for the taxpayer to verify the PPS number. Again this would be a further administrative burden.  Therefore, while I appreciate the proposal is attempting to thwart non-compliance for the present I do not believe this is the correct approach.</p><p>  Revenue s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy. Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects. A variety of methodologies are used by Revenue to identify those who are operating in the shadow economy including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre-arranged aspect queries on specific items.</p></reply>

This enables property owners to select a payment option that suits their particular circumstances and the Deputy should note that there is no additional charge for paying by debit card.  Owners who wish to pay their LPT in instalments but who are precluded from paying the tax by deduction at source from their DSP payment on account of the &euro;186 threshold, can spread their payments over the course of the year using monthly direct debits through certain credit union accounts or their bank account or, by making regular weekly or monthly payments to one of the three payment service providers which are An Post, Payzone and Omnivend. Details of the costs payable to the three service providers are set out on the Revenue website at.</p><p>  I am advised by the Commissioners that where a property owner discovers that deduction of LPT from their DSP scheme is not possible, they should contact the LPT Branch helpline on 1890 200 255 to make alternative arrangements for paying the tax or to confirm whether they are eligible to defer the charge.</p></reply>

Although a single carer may relinquish the credit such that it can be claimed by a non-primary carer, in cases where the primary carer has no entitlement to the credit then it cannot be relinquished to the secondary carer.  </p><p>  However, a single father would be entitled to the credit in cases where the child resides with him for the whole or greater part of the year, as he would be the primary carer in such a scenario, regardless of the marital status of the mother. In such circumstance, the single father would also be entitled to the child benefit payment.</p></reply>

Two externally driven developments, which were not known at the time of publication of Budget 2013, contributed to this bigger-than-expected contribution. Specifically, these were the upward revisions to Ireland's Gross National Income (GNI) and a number of EU amending budgets, which necessitated additional payments. </p><p>  A number of factors are taken into account in calculating Ireland's overall EU budget contribution. The GNI element accounts for approximately two thirds of Ireland's overall payment. Accordingly, our contribution is sensitive to movements in this measure. The European Commission conducts an annual rebalancing exercise on the basis of revisions to national GNI levels. This can involve rebalancing payments each December, either to or from the EU budget, depending upon national GNI movements. This exercise takes into account new and updated GNI data published by the CSO in the annual National Income and Expenditure Bulletin. Last year this led to an increase in Ireland's contribution.  </p><p>  Separately, EU expenditure for 2013 was much higher than had been originally budgeted for and this required a number of amending budgets which were agreed during the year. These included a draft amending budget for an unprecedented additional &euro;11.2 billion, two thirds of which was paid last year, with the balance to be paid this year. As, by their nature, these amending budgets are generally prepared in response to unforeseen events, they cannot be anticipated in advance. </p></reply>

The BRRD proposal provides a common framework of rules and powers to help EU countries manage arrangements to deal with failing banks at national level as well as cross-border banks, whilst preserving essential bank operations and minimising taxpayers' exposure to losses. </p><p>  There are three pillars to the BRRD framework to facilitate a range of appropriate actions by authorities:</p><p><b><i>- Preparatory and preventative measures</i></b>   including reinforced supervision and robust recovery and resolution planning for major institutions;</p><p><b><i>- Early intervention</i></b><b><i>measures </i></b>  which would include supervisory powers and implementing recovery plans;</p><p><b><i>- Resolution tools</i></b>   including appointing a special manager, sale of business, bridge bank, asset separation tools and the use of bail-in mechanisms.</p><p>  Bail-in will enable resolution authorities to write down or convert into equity the claims of shareholders and creditors of institutions that are failing or likely to fail. This is an important means of ensuring that a bank s losses are absorbed by those who fund its activities and not taxpayers. </p><p>  I welcome the introduction of this important piece of legislation which is designed to safeguard financial stability and to protect taxpayers funds. The legal text of the agreement is now being finalised by lawyer-linguists and it is expected to be adopted by the co-legislators in April but in any event no later than the end of the European Parliament s current term. Once the final legal text is published in the Official Journal, the rules will be transposed into national law over the course of 2014 and Member States will apply the BRRD from 1 January 2015. It should be noted however, that Member States have until 1 January 2016 to apply the bail-in provisions, although, they are not prevented from applying bail-in before this date.</p><p>  In advance of this the ECB/EBA will complete a Comprehensive Assessment in 2014 in anticipation of the ECB taking over direct supervision of euro-area banks under the Single Supervisory Mechanism later this year. As you are aware the purpose of the Comprehensive Assessment is to ensure that banks are appropriately capitalised going forward. This is seen as an important exercise by the ECB, as they want a clean bill of health for the banking sector in advance of them taking control of supervision. </p><p>  Irish banks were significantly recapitalised between 2009 and 2011. This was done in advance of the EBA capital exercises of 2011/2012, and a considerable strengthening of the banking sector took place. Irish Banks remain well capitalised today.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has recently concluded a Balance Sheet Assessment (BSA) in advance of this years Comprehensive Assessment and the Governor has informed me that there is no additional regulatory capital requirement in the banks as a result of this exercise. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware the forthcoming ECB/EBA Comprehensive Assessment will use a minimum capital threshold of 8% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and while I have not yet received the financial statements of the banks as of 31 December 2013, considering the strong capital positions of the banks as of June 2013, I would expect each of the banks to exceed the 8% Common Equity Tier 1 threshold.</p><p>  However, in the unlikely event of a capital requirement arising from the Comprehensive Assessment private sources of capital could be accessed both internally as well as from the capital markets. As recent transactions have demonstrated the Banks now have access to both the debt and equity markets and coupled with the improved market conditions this is a realistic source of capital.</p></reply>

However, I will clarify the position as regards the new tax credit.</p><p>  The One-Parent Family Tax Credit (OPFTC) has been replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit from 1 January 2014.   The restructured credit will be of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and it will also carry the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases it to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to higher rate of income tax arises.  However, the credit will be more targeted, in that it will in the first instance, only be available to the principal carer of the child. It is only by being entitled to the credit that an individual can obtain access to the extended standard rate band.</p><p>  Ultimately, the number of single fathers affected by this measure will depend on the family circumstances in each case. The person who receives the child benefit payment is being used as the initial indicator by the Revenue Commissioners to identify the individuals who are most likely to qualify for the new credit.  However, eligibility for the credit will in the first place be determined by who cares for the child for most of the year. Agreement as to who will be the principal carer of a child is a matter for parents or guardians. </p><p>  As a result of the Amendment which I brought forward at the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, a primary carer may relinquish the credit such that it can be claimed by a non-primary carer.</p><p>  To allow retention of the extended standard rate band by those who no longer qualify for the new tax credit, would ultimately only benefit such individuals with higher incomes, i.e. greater than &euro;32,800 per annum.</p><p>  It was always intended that the new credit would come into effect for the 2014 tax year and this was provided for in Finance Act (No. 2) 2013. Estimates of the expected yield from this measure in the initial year and in a full year were published in Budget 2014. These estimates were &euro;18 million and &euro;25 million respectively. The differences in the yields are generally as a result of the timing of tax returns.</p></reply>

The data relating to the public sector includes individuals in receipt of various forms of income from public sources that would not normally be regarded as constituting employment within the public service, e.g. those receiving fees, those on State Boards etc. On the basis of the available tax-based data it is not possible to identify and exclude income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as employed within the public service or to distinguish the earnings of employees associated with atypical work patterns. </p><p>  On this basis, the total numbers of public sector income earners and private sector income earners, including self-employed earners, who had earnings of less than &euro;30,000 in the tax year 2011 is 176,800 and 935,600 respectively. A married couple which has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</p></reply>

An amount of &euro;204k has been allocated for the first six months of 2014.</p><p>  I would like to inform the Deputy that Gaelscoileanna has been selected as the lead organisation to promote Irish medium/ immersion education and Irish -medium preschool education on an all-island basis from this July. </p><p>  My Department is aware of the excellent resources produced in Northern Ireland and COGG is in regular communication with colleagues from Northern Ireland with a view to sharing expertise.</p><p>  Provision is made within our services to ensure that there are sufficient resources to meet the demand for Continuous Professional Development (CPD) for Irish medium education. The Professional Development Service for Teachers have a clear mandate to respond to teachers needs for CPD and resources as appropriate and the Education Centre Network responds as required to local needs. </p><p>  The PDST work with their Northern Ireland counterparts (CESI) in the sharing of resources, knowledge and expertise for Irish medium education.</p><p>  It is also important to note that in the last few years patronage has been awarded to An Foras P&aacute;trunachta Na Scoileanna L&aacute;n Ghaeilge in respect of six schools.

This contribution has been levied by Institutes of Technology in respect of apprentices since 2004, with F&Aacute;S/SOLAS paying 70% of the contribution and apprentices themselves paying the remainder. As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS will cease making this payment to the Institutes of Technology and apprentices themselves will pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.</p><p>  The charge is &euro;833 for the vast majority of apprentices scheduled on an off the job phase in an Institute of Technology in the academic year 2013/14, but is more than this for a small number of apprentices attending phases that are longer than the typical 10-11 weeks.</p><p>  Apprentices will pay the same contribution as students, apportioned for the time they spend in the Institutes. Unlike students, apprentices are paid a training allowances by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in Institutes of Technology. This allowance is equivalent to the wages they receive from their employers for on the job phases and is unaffected by the budgetary changes. Although apprentices are not eligible to receive student grants, the value of their training allowance would be greater than the maintenance available under the student grant scheme.</p><p>  This decision was taken against a difficult budgetary background and there is no scope to re-visit it.  I am confident that apprentices, who are in receipt of allowances and have invested time and effort to reach phase 4 and 6 of their apprenticeships, will see the value of the programme they are on and remain to completion.</p></reply>

These new procedures have been developed following consultation with the relevant education partners and replace guidelines that were issued to schools in 1993.</p><p>  The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p><p>  The procedures however include important new oversight arrangements that involve the school Principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the parents association and published on the school website.</p><p>  All schools are now required to immediately commence the necessary arrangements for developing and formally adopting an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the new procedures. This is expected to be completed by each school as early as possible in the 2013/14 school year but in any event by no later than the end of the second term of the 2013/14 school year.</p></reply>

These are available on my Department's website. The aim of these proposals is to ensure that the way schools decide on applications for enrolment is structured, fair and transparent.</p><p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. Such a school can also refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion, provided it can prove that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.   The draft General Scheme does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation.</p><p>  I have referred the draft General Scheme and draft regulations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, to allow a full public discussion of the proposed legislative framework, including inputs from parents and the education partners.  The draft General Scheme and draft regulations are currently under consideration by the Joint Committee. When it has completed its consideration, I will reflect carefully on the Committee's report before progressing to the next stage of legislation.</p></reply>

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.</p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.</p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.</p><p>  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.</p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support. With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.</p></reply>

This operates at local school level. The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level schools in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools).</p><p>  My Department recently published new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools. These new procedures have been developed following consultation with the relevant education partners and replace guidelines that were issued to schools in 1993. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.</p><p>  In addition, my Department published Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention, which I launched jointly with Minister Kathleen Lynch last January. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p></reply>

The level of resources devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained and increased for this school year. </p><p>  The provision now includes 10,745 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), over 10,700 Learning Support and Resource Teachers, provision for over 740 Special Classes attached to mainstream schools at reduced pupil teacher ratios, enhanced capitation for special schools and special classes and provision for special transport arrangements and assistive technology support. </p><p>  The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs to be enrolled to. Supports will continue to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs. </p><p>  In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available. 740 Special Classes are being provided for mainstream schools for the current school year. This includes 118 new special classes which have been opened this year. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the previous Government capped the number of SNA posts at 10,575 in December 2010. In December 2013, this Government agreed to increase the cap on SNAs by 390, increasing by 170 posts to 10,745 at the end of 2013, and by a further 220 posts to 10,965 at the end of 2014. These additional posts provided will enable the National Council for Special Education to continue to allocate support to children who need it in order that they may fully participate in and benefit from their education. </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my decision last June to authorise the NCSE to maintain the level of resource teaching allocations to be provided for students with special educational needs for the current school year to the 2012/13 levels. This decision resulted in the subsequent allocation of an additional 455 posts in October to maintain resource teaching provision at the same levels as last year.  The level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs, enrolled in all schools, to ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.</p></reply>

In its principles the framework highlights the role of &quot;creativity and innovation&quot;.  There are 24 statements of learning which specify what students should know, understand, value and be able to do at the end of junior cycle. A number of the statements are relevant to enterprise but one in particular emphasises that the students &quot;should take initiative, be innovative and develop entrepreneurial skills&quot;. </p><p>  In senior cycle, there are opportunities to develop entrepreneurial skills through, for example, the Leaving Certificate Business Studies course or through participation in the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme Links modules and in the Leaving Certificate Applied.  For Transition Year students there is the opportunity to participate in the Sean Lemass Awards that include the Transition Year Mini Company and its &quot;Get up and Go&quot; competition and the County/ City Enterprise Board &quot;Student Enterprise &quot; Competition. In 2013, almost 16,000 students participated in the Student Enterprise competitions. </p><p>  Literacy and numeracy are among the most important life skills that our schools teach.  No child should leave school without having mastered these skills to the best of their abilities. Literacy and numeracy skills are crucial to a person's ability to develop fully as an individual, to live a satisfying and rewarding life and to participate fully in our society.  The Programme for Government makes clear that the Government is determined that all young people will leave school able to read, communicate orally, in writing and in digital media, and able to understand and use mathematics in their everyday lives and in further learning. Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life sets out how we will work to achieve these crucially important goals over the period to 2020. It sets ambitious targets and describes the actions that we must take to improve the teaching and learning of literacy and numeracy.  I am committed to our young people developing entrepreneurial skills and a number of initiatives, as noted above, are in place to make this a reality.</p></reply>

Pupil Teacher Ratio in respect of all schools is only available at national level and not disaggregated by county or any other variable. The most recent statistics are for the 2012/13 school year. The national average class size is 24.7 pupils. However, with over 20,800 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. The Government has protected frontline services in schools in the recent budget and there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2014/15 school year as a result of the budget. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. </p><p>  Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Staffing arrangements at primary and post primary level for the 2014/15 school year will be published on the Department website shortly.</p><p>  The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The Appeal Boards operate independently of the Department and their decisions are final.</p><p>The final staffing position for all schools at primary and post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the five year construction plan, that I announced on 9 March 2012, outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the plan.  The primary aim at the core of the five year plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.  Given the need to meet demographic growth, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects, to meet future demand will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years. In this context, it is not possible to indicate at this point when individual building projects will be progressed.  My Department will however consider applications by schools for funding for additional classrooms where an immediate enrolment need is arising.</p><p>  I wish to also advise the Deputy that commensurate with the level of funding available for the Summer Works Scheme, applications are currently being assessed on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the governing circular letter for the scheme.  This circular letter (59/2013) is available on my Department's website www.education.ie. It is my intention to publish a list of successful applicants in early 2014.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be well aware of my reasons for this from our meetings on this matter and from my response to his recent parliamentary question.   </p><p>  I am aware of the desire locally to avoid issues of duplication or intra-community rivalry in the establishment of a second school and this has resulted in a new proposal from the parents' group to amalgamate the two schools, either temporarily or permanently.

My Department will now be engaging with the Kildare and Wicklow ETB to consider this and I expect that the ETB will, in turn, be engaging further with the school leadership and parents in this regard.</p></reply>

It is open to the Councils to apply for funding to deal with coastal protection under the Office of Public Works' (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.    </p><p>  The Office of Public Works wrote on 10th January, 2014 to City and County Managers in coastal areas indicating that it will accept applications under its Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms.  This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre storm condition.  The specific application form for this entitled Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014 is available on OPW's website <i>www.opw.ie</i> under Flood Risk Management.  Any work for which funding is sought will be carried out by the Local Authorities.  It is also open to local authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using their own resources.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations is his sole prerogative.  The statute does not accord me as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform any function in this regard.</p><p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose including constructions affixed thereto are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Such exempt buildings would ordinarily include domestic dwellings, farm buildings, those used for public worship, education and health-care provided on a not-for-profit basis, buildings occupied and used for charitable purposes and buildings occupied by certain societies established for the advancement of science, literature and the fine arts which are used exclusively for that purpose and otherwise than for private profit.  The statute maintains the long-standing position that all other buildings occupied for whatever enterprise, including those used as recording and rehearsing facilities, are liable for rates unless used for an activity which has specific exemption under Schedule 4 of the Act.  </p><p>  My Department has no plans to provide for special treatment of recording and rehearsing facilities, under the Valuation Act as to do so would breach the legislation and, I believe, would give rise to demands for similar treatment from other sectors of the community involved in the provision of useful services, which in equity would be difficult to resist.  The process could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which if it were not to entail an increase in Exchequer funding of local authorities, would have to be made good by imposing a corresponding increase on the remaining ratepayers.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, in November 2011, the Government set out 2 commitments in relation to agency rationalisation:</p><p>- to implement 48 measures.  All of these (involving over 100 bodies) either have been fully delivered or will be delivered this year, apart from the small number where the Government decided on reflection not to proceed (viz. the rationalisation concerning the National Cancer Registry, and the proposed merger of the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Irish Aviation Authority); and</p><p>- to critically review proposals for a further 46 rationalisation measures.  In late 2012, following detailed consideration of these critical reviews, the Government decided to implement 25 agency rationalisation measures (involving more than a further 100 State bodies).  Work on these is well advanced;  some are already completed and  as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 which I launched last week the remainder will be delivered during 2014. </p><p>  My Department monitors the implementation of the measures on a quarterly basis and publishes these updates.  The latest information, which details the progress to end Quarter 4 2013, can be found on my Department's website at </p><p>  The Deputy asks about a number of specific measures that are in progress.</p><p>  The proposed merger of the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland was one of the proposals to be critically reviewed.  That review was completed in 2012 and, on foot of the review, the Government decided to proceed with the measure.  Work on the implementation is well underway.  It will require legislation, and the General Scheme of a Bill is expected to be brought to Government by mid-year.  In the meantime, the merger is being progressed on an administrative basis and, to facilitate this, ministerial responsibility for the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland will be transferred to the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  The Deputy has also asked about the State Laboratory and the Forensic Science Laboratory, which also were part of the critical review process.  Again, that critical review was completed in 2012, following which the Government decided to implement a rationalisation measure which involves placing the Forensic Science Laboratory within the ambit of the State Laboratory for professional leadership purposes, while allowing that the Forensic Science Laboratory will remain within the criminal justice system for operational purposes.  Work on this measure is progressing.</p></reply>

This is to be achieved through the better management of sick leave as well as a substantial reduction in the period of time for which paid sick leave will be available. </p><p>  Effective management of sick leave is a key element of the overall approach to reduce absenteeism in the public service.  In this context new policies and procedures on attendance management have been introduced across the public service.   These policies promote best practice in the management of sick leave and include: monitoring patterns of sick leave; maintaining supportive contact with officers on sick leave; referral to the Occupational Health Specialist; and conducting sick leave reviews and return to work interviews. </p><p>  In addition to the better management of sick leave, and in order to realise significant savings, the access to paid sick leave must also be reduced in accordance with the Labour Court Recommendation.</p><p>  In respect of the implementation date for the new sick leave scheme the public service employers, in their submission to the Labour Court, sought an implementation date of 2012 while the public service committee of ICTU sought an implementation date of 2016.  The Court recommended 1 January 2014, subject to the necessary legislative provisions.  This date has been deferred to allow for the regulations, to be made under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) (Amendment) Act 2013, to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for a period of 21 sitting days.</p><p>  There is no requirement to defer the introduction of the new sick leave scheme any further given the lapse of time since the initial Labour Court Recommendation as well as the finalisation of arrangements for the introduction of a Critical Illness Protocol which will faciliate access to extended sick leave for public service employees in the case of illnesses or medical conditions of specified severity following a further Labour Court Recommendation issued in December 2013.</p></reply>

Winning public sector contracts with innovative solutions also serves as an important reference point for companies who wish to sell those products or services in overseas markets.</p><p>  In the context of the overall reform of the public procurement structures in Ireland, the Government's priorities in relation to procurement are to:- review and update the Government's Procurement guidelines and procedures to address any obstacles to SMEs participating as fully as possible in the public procurement process;- improve the capacity of SMEs to tender for public sector contracts.</p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement will address these priorities by:- simplifying tender documentation which will help both businesses and buyers to reduce administrative costs;- subdividing larger contracts into smaller &quot;lots&quot;;- encouraging SME's to create consortia to compete with larger businesses;- engaging with Business Representative Groups to identify and resolve issues;- educating buyers and suppliers regarding public procurement practices;- ensuring engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost, with proportional financial and other qualification criteria, and proportional contract terms and conditions; and,- operating and updating a single procurement web portal for supplier to receive information, register and to receive alerts.</p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend.  We are also committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.</p></reply>

There are restrictions and there are targets to reduce, in overall terms, the numbers employed in the public service, but there has also been and will continue to be recruitment into key positions across the system - in health, in education, in some areas of the Civil Service and most recently in An Garda.   Recruitment into these positions is open to all suitable candidates, including those who are availing of JobBridge.</p><p>  The JobBridge initiative, which is run by the Department of Social Protection, provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period.  The key goal of JobBridge is to assist jobseekers in gaining valuable work experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers seeking to learn new skills.  The purpose of the scheme is to give people an opportunity to gain experience and skills that will help them find permanent employment, and it has proven very effective in that regard.

This natural and ongoing process needs to be considered in a holistic way as its impact can vary greatly in different locations and over time.  It only becomes a problem when it threatens human life, infrastructure and properties.  It differs significantly from coastal flooding, as assets are permanently lost.  Dealing with problems of coastal erosion also requires a somewhat different approach to problems of flooding and must be addressed in a sensitive manner.  Engineered interventions to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; an erosion problem must be considered carefully having regard to the natural processes in operation in any particular location and the economic viability of any measures that would be required to address the problem. </p><p>  The Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) is a major examination to assess and identify the most significant areas of erosion risk for the entire national coastline.  This major study is effectively complete and it will provide essential information required to inform policy in this area going forward particularly in relation to guiding decisions by planners on local coastal planning issues.</p><p>  The management of problems of coastal protection in any particular area is first and foremost a matter for the relevant Local Authority.  Local Authorities must assess the problem in the first instance and, if it is considered that specific measures and works are required, it is open to them to apply for funding to deal with coastal protection under the Office of Public Works' (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works wrote on 10th January, 2014 to City and County Managers in coastal areas indicating that it will accept applications under its Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms.  This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre storm condition.  The specific application form for this entitled Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014 is available on OPW's website <i>www.opw.ie</i> under Flood Risk Management.  Any work for which funding is sought will be carried out by the Local Authorities.</p><p>  It is also be open to Local Authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using their own resources.</p></reply>

The Commission&rsquo;s preliminary version of the proposed Scoreboard was subsequently presented as a component of the draft Joint Employment Report, which was presented to the Council on the 28<sup>th</sup> November 2013 as an annexe to the 2014 Annual Growth Survey.</p><p>  Ireland has supported the development of a scoreboard of employment and social indicators as an instrument that can underpin the contribution of the EPSCO Council of Employment and Social Policy Ministers to the agenda set by the European Council regarding the reinforcement of the social dimension of the EMU within the current institutional framework.  The Scoreboard, which was adopted by the EPSCO Council at its meeting on 9<sup>th</sup> December 2013, is a welcome development on the deliberations that took place within the EPSCO Council under the Irish Presidency, including the informal breakfast meeting that Employment and Social Policy Ministers had with Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council on 28<sup>th</sup> February, an historic first meeting.</p><p>  Ireland welcomes the new Scoreboard of employment and social indicators which will complement and build upon existing tools<b></b>(the <i>Employment and Social Protection Performance Monitors</i>) within the European Semester.  The Scoreboard will not have any automatic consequences or trigger any binding sanctions.  Ireland has consistently supported the development of such a scoreboard as an analytical tool to detect emerging divergences and negative developments that are relevant to EMU and that require urgent <i>collective</i> attention and action.</p><p>  The December European Council re-affirmed the importance of employment and social developments within the European Semester.  Its conclusions build on the commitment made by the European Council in June to strengthen the social dimension of the EMU.</p></reply>

In particular, the draft Regulation is designed to build on those provisions relating to the statutory audits of public interest entities set out in Directive 2006/43/EC.  These draft audit measures are the product of long and intensive negotiations and impose less onerous obligations than those originally proposed by the EU Commission. </p><p>  The audit measures are expected to be adopted in the first half of 2014 and the Regulation will take effect two years after its adoption date, with an equivalent period provided for the transposition by Member States of the draft Directive.</p><p>  My Department established a contact group of interested parties during the negotiation period of these draft Audit package.  It is the intention of the Department to consult with stakeholders on the adoption of these Audit measures as regards their implementation in Irish company law.</p><p>  Based on figures supplied to the Department by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), which are currently being updated, there are in the region of 1,200 public interest entities in Ireland.  It is not envisaged that there will be increased direct costs to the Exchequer in relation to the implementation of these measures, either as regards the audits of public interest entities or of companies other than public interest entities.  The costs of implementing the EU Audit measures to Public Interest Entities to which they apply cannot be quantified, but it is expected that there will some increased costs.</p></reply>

The Forum met six times over the summer and autumn of 2013, and was chaired by entrepreneur and investor Sean O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p><p>  The Report was presented to Government today and it will be launched later this week.</p><p>  The rationale for establishing the Forum was to take suggestions and advice from people who have actually taken the entrepreneurial route, have direct experience of the challenges facing entrepreneurs and can provide a relevant insight into the responses needed in the current economic environment. The set of recommendations put forward by the Forum are a valuable contribution to work currently being undertaken in my Department to develop a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement.</p></reply>

The allocation of funding to individual CEBs is conducted each year by the Central Coordination Unit (CCU) within Enterprise Ireland. </p><p>  The Current funding allocations are made in respect of the estimated cost of salaries and administration for the year. The bulk of this non-capital allocation to each CEB pays the salaries of the Business Advisors and other staff who provide direct advice and mentoring to client companies. This represents a strong investment in the micro-enterprise sector, notwithstanding the additional level of demand on CEB services generated in the current difficult economic climate.</p><p>  The Capital allocations are used to provide so-called &ldquo;Measure 1&rdquo; (direct grant assistance) and &ldquo;Measure 2&rdquo; (training and development) supports for micro-enterprises employing up to 10 staff. In determining the Capital allocations, a systematic approach is adopted by the CCU to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  This approach involves the provision of funding on the basis of a standard allocation to each CEB, as well as an extra allocation that is determined mainly by population but which also takes account of issues such as local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread. </p><p>  As part of the CCU&rsquo;s on-going management of available funding during the year, the Unit monitors CEB spending on a regular basis. Should any surplus funding become available, this surplus will be reallocated by the CCU to any Boards that are in a position to spend additional funds, subject to thorough assessment of the rationale and the justification for the level of funding being requested.</p><p>  The Capital allocations include additional funding which was allocated to the CEBs in the final quarter of each of these years. The funding was secured from unused funding elsewhere within the Department.</p><p><b>Table 1: 2011</b><table><tr><th>CEB</th><th>Exchequer Pay Allocation</th><th>Exchequer Non Pay

A range of categories of employment, such as Meat Deboners, which would fall under the category of &ldquo;General Operative&rdquo; are classified as ineligible for new employment permits.</p><p>  The statistics for the number of employment permits issued to meat plants over the past 3 years bear this out and are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Total Permits Issued</b></th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>25</td></tr></table></p><p>  Of these, 28% were Spousal/Dependant employment permits, which are available for spouses/dependants of Green Card holders and Researchers and are open to all employments.</p><p>  The remaining 72% of employment permits issued in this area would be renewals &ndash; i.e.  in respect of non-EEA nationals already in the State in this employment who are renewing their employment permits or applying for a new employment permit for a new employer.</p><p>  I am strongly of the view that this sector offers vital opportunities to create sustainable employment in Ireland. The statistics speak for themselves. There are currently over 10,000 people directly employed in meat processing and in many Irish towns the meat processing sector is still the biggest employer.  In addition, approximately 75,000 farmers are supplying the meat processing sector.  My Department and the Department of Social Protection are working closely together to ensure that the employment permits system works in tandem with, and in support of, the Cross-Government initiatives in place to reduce unemployment in the State, in particular in the area of assessing labour market demands in the context of the Live Register.  </p><p>  I understand that a potential skills gap in this area is currently being considered by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  In this context, Skillnets, the enterprise-led body funded through the National Training Fund (NTF) under the aegis of the Minister for Education and Skills, has been involved with two of its training networks in the development and provision of a range of knife skills courses for the beef, pork and poultry sectors. I understand that a boning and knife skills traineeship is under development for roll-out in 2014, following consultation with the meat industry and other stakeholders. Consultation with, and participation by, the meat industry in the development of such courses is vital in order to identify and address any skills gaps.</p></reply>

The CEBs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level. They are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start a business. Contact details for the CEBs are available on . </p><p>  The CEBs generally only grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. Retail enterprises are ineligible for direct financial support from the CEBs due to concerns over displacement (where grant-assisted projects simply displace business from other players in the local market). </p><p>  However, any start-up can use the CEBs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal. Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB.</p><p>  In addition, locally trading businesses, including start-ups can avail of non-financial assistance from their CEB in the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc. Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business, taxation for beginners, internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills.</p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs also included a number of measures designed to help the retail sector.  These include a project to streamline the application process for business licences in the retail sector, and an initiative to encourage more businesses to trade on-line.  Developments on these initiatives will be reported on a quarterly basis on my Department&rsquo;s website,   , as part of the Action Plan for Jobs Progress Reports.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the system for delivery of State supports to micro and small enterprises is being reformed and that the 35 existing County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will be dissolved and new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will be created. This reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and economic recovery and growth. The target date for the legal dissolution of the CEBs and the formal launch of the LEOs is mid-April, 2014.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the recent severe weather conditions under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA).</p><p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. This is to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. There is no automatic entitlement to a payment. Examples of the main types of needs that may be met under this provision in respect of severe weather conditions includes assistance towards the purchase of household appliances, bedding, clothing and household repair and maintenance.</p><p>  In addition to the payment of ENPs, SWA legislation also provides for assistance in the form of an urgent needs payment (UNP) which can be made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA.  The person may be required to pay the money back in respect of a UNP at a later date, for example, if the person had significant capital or income or was later compensated by an insurance company.</p><p>  In response to the recent weather events the humanitarian assistance scheme has been activated. The humanitarian assistance scheme, which is means-tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and, in some instances, structural repairs as a result of the flooding damage.  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted. Humanitarian assistance does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses. </p><p>  Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the recent weather events should contact the Department&rsquo;s local representative administering SWA who may be able to offer assistance.</p></reply>

It also extended the options available to trustees in any consideration of a restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act.</p><p>  The change to the wind up rules provided for the application of different wind up rules depending on whether the employer is solvent or insolvent. This change enhanced the priority of deferred scheme member&rsquo;s benefits in the event of the wind up of a pension scheme. </p><p>  Prior to the recent change to the Pensions Act, the trustees of a pensions scheme could restructure active and deferred scheme member&rsquo;s benefits and post retirement increases in pension benefits. The change to section 50 of the Pensions Act extends the categories of benefits which can be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits to include a portion of pensioner benefits. This change essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members.   </p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board.  This guidance makes provision for the notification of all scheme members in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits.  In such circumstances, scheme members will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits.</p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries.</p></reply>

It is not possible to provide a breakdown of Jobbridge participants by each of the Local Authority areas in the Dublin region. </p><p>  JobBridge is giving opportunities to jobseekers across the spectrum of qualifications.  In the independent evaluation of JobBridge, it was found that 35.9% of interns hold qualifications below primary degree level, with 22.4% of interns having a post-graduate qualification. Given those high numbers of interns holding graduate and post-graduate qualifications, it is obviously necessary that JobBridge is in a position to offer them an internship that meets their needs.</p><p>  It is worthy of note that many professions and occupations offered internships to graduates prior to the commencement of Jobbridge. One of the advantages of Jobbridge is that it allows unemployed people including unemployed graduates access to these internships while retaining their social welfare payment.</p><p><b>Table 1.

Secondly, her mortgage arrears were of such magnitude that it was not deemed reasonable to award a supplement; social welfare legislation provides that where payment of a supplement is unlikely to prevent repossession due to high arrears, payment of a mortgage interest supplement is to be avoided. Thirdly, it is required that an applicant for mortgage interest supplement must first show that he/she had entered into an alternative payment arrangement with their lender, and had complied with that arrangement for twelve months or longer.

Community Employment (CE) is not generally intended for persons under 25 years of age as there are other more appropriate and suitable interventions for that cohort, for example, training programmes provided under the Local Education and Training Boards (ETBs). However, the Department is prepared to consider in certain circumstances, supporting on a limited basis innovatory proposals that are tailored to meet the needs of persons between 20- 25 years.  This would involve the provision of a FETAC Major Award as part of the Employment Programme as well as work-based learning with a target of gaining employment as the main outcome.

This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. T&uacute;s is designed to break the cycle of unemployment, and maintain work readiness thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities in returning to the labour market. </p><p>  The duration of the T&uacute;s contract was set to reflect a number of inter-related elements. These include the need to ensure that limited numbers of placements available are opened to those on the live register, that weaknesses identified in other work programmes resulting from longer duration placements are not replicated in T&uacute;s, optimisation of the resources available, and how T&uacute;s fits with the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s activation policies in Pathways to Work. </p><p>  It also ensures that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the initiative. As of the week ending 10 January 2014, 7,123 participants were working and in receipt of a payment on T&uacute;s. An additional 369 full-time supervisory/team leader personnel had been engaged by the implementing bodies for T&uacute;s. Since its inception in July 2011, some 14,642 participants have completed 12 months on T&uacute;s. </p><p>  There are no circumstances under which a person&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s will be extended beyond 12 months and I consider the existing 12-month period on T&uacute;s to be adequate to meet the programme&rsquo;s objectives.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  The implementation of revised maximum rent limits under the rent supplement scheme was approved by Government on 5 June 2013, following an extensive review of the private rental market undertaken by the Department.  The revised rent limits came into effect on 17 June 2013 and will remain in place until 31 December 2014.  The emphasis of the review was to ensure that value for money was achieved whilst, at the same time, ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. </p><p>  During the rent limit review, the Department used information from rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to analyse actual rental costs in each county across the country. The Department also used publicly available data sources including the Central Statistics Office rental indices, the Daft.ie Rental Report and websites, advertising rental properties to ascertain both the market trends and the current asking prices for one, two and three bedroom properties.  Rent limits were set to ensure that approximately 35% of available supply of housing is available to rent supplement tenancies. </p><p>  The Department also sought the views of a number of stakeholders to inform the review process, including Departmental staff with responsibility for the administration of the rent supplement scheme. </p><p>  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and Galway while there have been some reductions across a number of rural counties reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties. Separate to the county limits, higher rent limits have been provided for in North Kildare and Bray areas. </p><p>  Officials in the Department will continue to monitor the impact of the revised rates ensuring that the accommodation needs of rent supplement recipients are met. </p></reply>

Under the provisions of carer&rsquo;s benefit and carer&rsquo;s leave legislation, a person claiming carer&rsquo;s benefit may take up limited employment outside the home for up to 15 hours per week. Earnings from this limited employment cannot exceed &euro;332.50 per week.</p><p>  The employer confirmed that the person in question was working within the limited hours and earnings per week and carer&rsquo;s benefit was awarded from 10 January 2013 to 7 January 2015.  Following a control check, involving an investigation by a social welfare inspector (SWI) it was established that the person concerned works less than 15 hours per week apart from one week per month when the person in question works 4 consecutive nights. Both the hourly limit and earnings limit for these particular weeks are exceeded.</p><p>  Carer&rsquo;s benefit legislation states that a person who, having been in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit for less than 6 weeks, ceases to be entitled to that benefit they shall be disqualified for receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit for 6 weeks from the last day for which he or she was entitled to the benefit.   Therefore, where a person does not satisfy the conditions for receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit for 1 week out of every 4, they are also deemed not to satisfy the conditions for the other 3 weeks.</p><p>  On 11 December 2013 a letter was issued to the person concerned outlining the circumstances as the Department sees them and the consequences of those circumstances and giving them the opportunity to present their own case in response.</p><p>  On 17 January 2014 a formal decision was issued to the person concerned stating that her carer&rsquo;s benefit claim has been suspended.  A copy of this letter including correspondence received from the person concerned was forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office for an appeal to be opened.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office will be in direct contact with the person concerned in due course.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal.  Currently a person's date of entry into insurance is taken as the date used for averaging purposes.  To qualify for a state pension a person must:</p><p>- have entered insurance before the age of 66;</p><p>- have at least 520 paid contributions; and</p><p>- satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 is required for a full rate pension).</p><p>  An increase for a qualified adult, which is a means tested payment may be made to an individual who does not qualify for a pension in their own right or qualifies for a lower rate of pension due to gaps in insurance or the means tested non-contributory pension may be available to an individual who meets the qualifying criteria.</p><p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The scheme was designed to with a view to ensuring that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited.  Under the pension reform programme, there is a plan to adopt a total contributions approach where the number of contributions paid over a work life will closely reflect the rate of payment received.  For example, 30 years of contributions (1560) could qualify a person for maximum State pension (contributory).  A person wold accumulate 1/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum of 30/30ths inclusive of a certain number of credits.  The introduction of new rate bands in September 2012 moves somewhat closer to this process.  It had been planned to introduce this change in 2020 but in the context of changing demographics and longer working, this date may be brought forward. </p><p>  In relation to the person concerned, she entered social insurance on 6 November 1967.  In this case, when determining entitlement to State pension contributory (SPC) the yearly average is calculated from her date of entry into insurance to the last complete tax year before reaching their 66 birthday.  This person has a yearly average of 14 which equates to the current rate payable to her.  Under the current legislative provision, there is no other way in which to calculate the rate of pension payment.</p></reply>

The making of an addition to, or a deletion from, the Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the relevant planning authority, in these cases Cork County Council and Dublin City Council respectively.  </p><p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) is a State initiative under the administration of my Department.  Its purpose is to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 architectural heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid in the protection and conservation of the built heritage.  I recommend structures rated as being of regional importance or above to the planning authorities for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.</p><p>  Neither the school at The Pike, Lisavaird, County Cork nor the old British Legion Hall in Killester is recorded on the NIAH or on the Record of Protected Structures for Cork or Dublin respectively.  Under the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act 2000, as amended, the local authority is the planning authority and the decision-making body in the first instance in relation to planning applications.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the appeals authority for planning applications.  My role in relation to planning applications is limited to that of statutory consultee in cases where a proposed development may have an effect on natural, archaeological or architectural heritage.</p><p>  My Department has not made any interventions in relation to either building and, in this regard, I would refer the Deputies to Cork County Council and Dublin City Council respectively as the relevant planning authorities.</p></reply>

In that context, a number of issues are currently being addressed, including legal title to the site, planning requirements and overall funding for the project.  I should say that all the stakeholders have indicated their full support for ensuring that the project is brought to fruition.</p><p>  I consider it very fitting that this project is being advanced as part of the 1916 Commemorations Programme since the development of Pearse's Cottage will bring together the legacy of Pearse's contribution to Irish history and education and, in particular, his involvement with the Irish language and the Gaeltacht community.  I am satisfied that this development will also create excellent opportunities, not only for the community of Ros Muc, but also for the wider region.  It will undoubtedly benefit the area in terms of increased tourism, particularly in terms of cultural tourism and the creation of employment in the area.  Indeed, I am advised that Pearse's Cottage is afforded special recognition in F&aacute;ilte Ireland's Connemara Destination Plan, Wild Atlantic Way and Connemara Driving Tour and is a key component of the strategy to develop the tourism sector in Connemara.</p></reply>

The aim of the project is to build a centre that will provide additional services in high quality facilities for the benefit of both the local Irish speaking community and Irish language course participants and which will also increase the employment opportunities in the Gaeltacht.  Accordingly, the main objectives of the project are:</p><p>  - To strengthen the Irish language as the household language in the area in line with the objectives of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language</i> by providing childcare facilities and family resource services and to create a language haven for Irish language speakers; and</p><p>  - To sustain and develop language-based employment in the area by providing modern offices, enterprise and training space.</p><p>  I am pleased that my Department was in a position to provide funding of &euro;1,746,765 towards the cost of the project over a three-year period. During the construction phase, it is envisaged that the development will create employment in the area as well as having direct and indirect economic impacts. Based on analysis by the Construction Federation of Ireland on the impact of capital projects, it is expected that this project will create up to 40 jobs in the construction industry during the building phase and 80 jobs in other sectors in the local economy.</p><p>  I understand from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that the local co-operative pays, on average, salaries to 220 people in a full year, or 47 full-time equivalents. It is envisaged that the new facilities being developed will enable the continuation of this employment. In addition, the project will create new opportunities to build upon existing language-based employment in the local Gaeltacht area in the enterprise, cultural tourism, training, education and childcare services sectors. It is estimated that these new facilities will provide an opportunity to create up to 20 new full-time job equivalents in the long-term.</p></reply>

Section 11 of the Gaeltacht Act 2012 provides for the designation of such language communities as Irish Language Networks, i.e. areas that have achieved a basic critical mass of community and State support for the Irish language. The Act provides Foras na Gaeilge with a statutory role in assisting organisations with the preparation and implementation of language plans in Irish Language Networks. My Department recently published Language Planning Guidelines which detail the process for obtaining recognition as an Irish Language Network. These guidelines can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at: .</p><p>  In line with its statutory remit, Foras na Gaeilge provides a range of supports for the promotion of the Irish language in the community on an all-island basis. These supports include:</p><p>  - An Sc&eacute;im Phobal Gaeilge under which officers are employed by local communities to implement language development plans in their areas;</p><p>  - A funding scheme for the establishment of language networks within communities;</p><p>  - Sc&eacute;im na gCampa&iacute; Samhraidh which assists local groups outside of the Gaeltacht to organise youth summer camps through Irish;</p><p>  - Sc&eacute;im na nImeachta&iacute; &Oacute;ige which enables communities to organise youth clubs/activities outside of school hours;</p><p>  - Sc&eacute;im na bhF&eacute;ilte which facilitates the organisation of Irish language events as part of festivals;</p><p>  - Sc&eacute;im na gComplachta&iacute; Dr&aacute;ma&iacute;ochta which assists Irish language drama groups; and</p><p>  - An Sc&eacute;im Taca&iacute;ochta Gn&oacute; which assists SMEs in using Irish within the commercial business sector.</p><p>  In addition, Foras na Gaeilge recently announced the selection of six lead organisations to operate in the following key areas of Irish language promotion and development on an all-island basis:</p><p>  (i) Irish-medium/immersion education and Irish-medium pre-school education;</p><p>  (ii) Awareness raising, language protection and representation;</p><p>  (iii) Education in the English-language sector and for adults, and opportunities for school pupils to use the language;</p><p>  (iv) Opportunities which support the use of Irish and the establishment of networks;</p><p>  (v) Community and economic development; and,</p><p>  (vi) Development of opportunities for the use of Irish and of networks for young people.</p><p>The organisations selected are Gaelscoileanna, Conradh na Gaeilge, Gael Linn, Oireachtas na Gaeilge, Gl&oacute;r na nGael and Cumann na bhFiann.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in the Irish market can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in Counties Leitrim and Sligo. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in Kinlough in County Leitrim and in Strandhill in County Sligo before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy.</p><p>  The Plan recognises the importance of efficient and cost effective approval systems to facilitate the rollout of telecommunciations infrastructure. Since its publication, changes to the planning and permitting regimes have taken place or are underway. These changes include new guidelines to Local Authorities from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to mast infrastructure, the development of a software platform to accept single electronic applications to Local Authorities for road openings and for installation of street furniture, as well as guidance from the National Roads Authority in relation to hosting telecommunications infrastructure along all major routes. </p><p>  In tandem with commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

The Directive also requires that all biofuels used to meet the 10% target must comply with certain sustainability criteria. That is, they must not be made from feedstocks sourced from certain categories of land, and must achieve certain greenhouse gas emissions reductions.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 by the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 as the primary means through which Ireland would meet the transport target.  The scheme, administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), is certificate based and, since January 2013, an obligated road transport fuel supplier, at the end of each obligation period (calendar year), must hold six biofuel obligation certificates for every 94 litres of petroleum based fuel it has placed on the market. Certificates are only issued for biofuels that have been demonstrated to have complied with the sustainability criteria of the Directive. </p><p>  The Renewable Energy Directive requires that the contribution made by biofuels produced from wastes, residues, non-food cellulosic material, and ligno-cellulosic material be considered to be twice that made by other biofuels. Section 44G of the Act gives effect to this provision and requires NORA to issue two certificates for each litre of sustainable biofuel that the agency has determined has been made from such materials.  I understand that in the last week NORA determined that biofuels from Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) would be eligible for double certificates. POME is a harmful waste product generated from palm oil production and requires effective treatment before it can be safely discharged into watercourses and biofuel can be a by-product of this treatment. NORA has previously determined that biofuels produced from used cooking oil and biofuels produced from category 1 tallow qualify for double certificates. Details of its determinations are available on its website .</p><p>  The legislation requires NORA to consult with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the Environmental Protection Agency and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government before finalising determinations. I also understand that it received submissions from An Taisce and the Laois Environmental Action Forum on the matter.</p></reply>

Accommodation and staffing are among the most significant cost components of public sector organisations and it is incumbent on all agencies to achieve economy and efficiency.  In this context, the Board of IFI has commenced a strategic rationalisation of its Dublin based accommodation.  On its establishment, IFI had accommodation at three locations in Swords, including leasing a headquarters building, and premises in Glasnevin and Blackrock.  As part of this rationalisation, and in keeping with Government policy to exit from expensive leases wherever possible, IFI exercised the break clause on the Swords Headquarters when it arose and has already disposed of the Glasnevin premises.</p><p>  A key part of the accommodation strategy is the rationalisation and amalgamation of all Dublin property, including the Blackrock Office.  This rationalisation strategy will generate efficiencies and savings over time in relation to lease rents.  In addition, the significantly better energy efficiency of the new Headquarters facility in City West, which will also be consistent with Government commitments as regards reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption, will also generate efficiencies.  The rationalisation will also assist in financing the fitting out of the new headquarters and other property rationalisations outside Dublin.</p><p>  I am advised that the current proposal is to transfer Blackrock staff to the new IFI Headquarters Office in Citywest when it is complete.  I am further informed that this rationalisation is being undertaken in conformity with Public Financial Procedures, including capital appraisal, and that IFI has consistently engaged with all staff on these matters and are continuing to do so through the normal Industrial Relations channels.</p></reply>

In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240m in equity from the Minister for Finance and &euro;490m from the Local Government Fund but no other funding from the Department&rsquo;s Vote for establishment or other costs.  Irish Water is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2016 that will provide for the transition of projects previously included in my Department&rsquo;s 2010 - 2013 Water Services Investment Programme.</p><p>  My Departmental costs and Local Authority costs relating to the Water Sector Reform Programme have been met from the Departmental Vote.  These costs amount to &euro;15.7m in the period 2012 - 2013.  The majority of this expenditure related to funding provided to local authorities to meet the costs of the pre-installation survey required as part of the domestic metering programme and the staffing costs of the Water Services Transition Office which was put in place to ensure appropriate arrangements for engagement with the local authority sector during the reform process.</p><p>  The delivery of water services under a public utility model is expected to bring benefits in terms of access to new sources of revenue to fund greater investment in water services infrastructure and provide more efficient and better quality of service for customers.  To date the majority of the costs of water services provision have been met by the Exchequer and local authorities from their own resources and general purpose grants , with some income from the commercial sector.  The Irish Water funding model is expected to yield a potential saving of the order of &euro;2 billion to the State.  This is based on a comparison between the projected funding under such traditional arrangements to 2021 and the Irish Water funding model and reflects projections in relation to potential customer revenue, likely levels of State support, access to funding on capital markets, and efficiency gains.  The Government has not yet decided on the budgetary provision for Irish Water for 2015 and beyond.</p></reply>

The role of my Department is to drive the overall water sector reform process which includes developing the policy and legislation and ensuring delivery of the implementation strategy which was published in December 2012.  The role of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) was key to bringing the necessary skills and competencies to the project, allowing the utility to be established within an ambitious timeline at least cost and least risk, by leveraging from their knowledge, systems and skills and matching this with skills within the water sector.  It was recognised that in addition external service providers would be required as part of this process.</p><p>  BGE had responsibility for most of the deliverables under the Government water sector reform implementation strategy.  BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012.  They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m plus &euro;30m contingency and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources.  The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives.  It was understood from the engagement with BGE that the majority of the funding under the heading of brand management and customer engagement would be used for customer engagement.</p><p>  These establishment costs were initially funded by BGE and subsequently financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF).  No Exchequer funds or voted Department expenditure has been provided to BGE or to Irish Water for establishment costs.  As these costs were to be included in the overall funding model for Irish Water, they would also be examined by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.  Against this background, and in advance of the establishment of Irish Water, my Department provided confirmation to BGE that spending being properly incurred on the water services activities would be recoverable in the event that the project was not proceeded with or, subject to meeting certain conditions, be recoverable as part of the funding model to be reviewed by the Commission.  This initial commitment was provided by my Department in December 2012 and updated on a number of occasions in advance of the incorporation of Irish Water and the consent to the NPRF lending.  My consent, given with consent of the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, for Irish Water to enter into the loan arrangement with the NPRF for metering and establishment costs was provided in July 2013, with an understanding of the overall estimated budget involved.  My Department was notified of some &euro;62m in spending over the course of the months immediately prior to the incorporation of Irish Water in July 2013. In compliance with the conditions attached by my Department to the recovery of establishment costs, BGE confirmed that public procurement rules were being observed and provided a report on the outcome of the process in March 2013.</p><p>  The procurement by Irish Water of external resources was a matter for the company and I had no role in approving individual contracts.  However, the company has indicated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last week that the following major companies were used by the Irish Water Programme to help deliver the required systems and processes in the establishment of Irish Water - IBM, Accenture, Ernst &amp;amp; Young and KPMG.  The company also indicated that to date some &euro;50m has been spent on external service providers in establishing Irish Water.  Further details of the contracts relating to the establishment of Irish Water are set out in the submission made by the company to the Joint Oireachtas Committee last week and this submission has been published on the company&rsquo;s website at www.water.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-21a.841.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012100071#WRQ04100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 423, 427, 442, 469, 481 and 483 to 488, inclusive, together.</p><p>  The Programme for Government sets out a commitment to the introduction of water charges based on usage above a free allowance.  The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.</p><p>  The current water meter installation programme commenced in August 2013 and the approved budget for the programme is &euro;539 million (excluding VAT) which includes the supply of materials and the installation work by contractors operating in eight regions.  The total spend on the programme at the end of 2013 amounted to approximately &euro;35 million.  It is estimated that 1.05 million meters will be installed under the programme; with about 400,000 by the end of this year, over 800,000 by the end of 2015 and the balance in 2016.  The current rate of installation is some 27,000 meters a month and approximately 94,000 meters have been installed to date.  A breakdown of the installations by region is set out in the following table.</p><p><i>Meter installations by region</i><table><tr><th>Region </th><th>All </th><th>North West </th><th>West </th><th>South West </th><th>North East </th><th>Dublin City </th><th>Midlands </th><th>County Dublin </th><th>South East </th></tr><tr><td>Meter </td><td>93,640 </td><td>7,012 </td><td>6,520 </td><td>7,790 </td><td>12,445 </td><td>13,613 </td><td>22,064 </td><td>15,646 </td><td>8,550 </td></tr></table></p><p>  A study by Irish Water on the approach to metering further categories of households, including apartments and properties with shared service connections, has been finalised and recently submitted to my Department.  The approach in relation to such households will be developed when the study has been considered in more detail.  The nature of the works may restrict access to driveways temporarily and will cause some disruption to the public road or footpath outside people's homes and area, which may last for a few days.  Irish Water advises that this is unavoidable, but it is endeavouring to keep this disruption to a minimum and to ensure that safe pedestrian access to properties is retained while the work is carried out.  There may be instances where access to driveways is blocked overnight to ensure that reinstatement is carried out to the highest level and this is done in accordance with all relevant health and safety requirements, including facilitating access by emergency vehicles.  A strong focus has been placed on customer communications during this process and any additional support or advice can be arranged for householders with any disability, mobility or medical concerns by ringing the Irish Water call centre (1890 278 278) in advance of the meter installation.  The meter will be installed, where possible, at the stop valve on the public footpath or verge outside a property.  The water meters are the property of Irish Water and it is illegal to tamper with a meter. However, it will be possible for a customer to access the meter to verify readings.</p><p>  Irish Water will aim to reuse existing water meters that are owned by the local authority, where possible.  If the meter has the potential to be reused it will be removed and examined to make sure that this is possible.  If it is suitable it will be reused within the programme.  Where it is not deemed possible to reuse the meter, it will be disposed of in the most sustainable manner possible by the contractor in accordance with the requirements of the contract.</p><p>  The contractors for the 8 meter regions received, as part of their contract, details of the panel of subcontractors formed by my Department.  The contractors may employ from that list, but are under no obligation to do so.  The employment of subcontractors is a matter for each regional contractor. Irish Water carries out compliance checks on the contractors.  All contractors have also provided information on employees to ensure compliance with the social Inclusion obligations.  Data supplied to the Department by Irish Water indicates the following levels of employment created by the metering programme to date.   </p><p>Employment created by metering programme   <table><tr><th>No of employees on contract </th><th>No of employees from SMES </th><th>No of employees from unemployment register </th><th>No of apprentices/graduates <br /><br />&amp;amp; school leavers </th></tr><tr><td>871 </td><td>475 </td><td>156 </td><td>57 </td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>54.5% </td><td>17.9% </td><td>6.5% </td></tr></table></p><p>As the metering programme will still be underway when charges are introduced, an appropriate approach to charging customers who are not metered at that stage will be put in place.  This will be structured in such a way as to ensure that it represents a reasonable proxy for usage and is fair.  The approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties will be included in a public consultation which will be undertaken by the Commission for Energy Regulation as part of the regulatory process.</p></reply>

The agreements signed between Irish Water and individual local authorities were based on a generic template.  A copy of the generic Service Level Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The agreements signed by each authority and Irish Water were tailored to the individual authority circumstances, reflecting numbers of local authority staff covered and the operational budgets appropriate to the cost of providing water services within each authority area.</p><p>  The Service Level Agreements are based on achieving efficiencies without the need for incentive payments.  They are set in the context of a Framework Agreement for Service Level Agreements agreed at the Irish Water Consultative Group.  This agreement outlines that the Service Level Agreement will include a programme to improve the efficiencies in water services operations, including investment in infrastructure and new technologies, training and up-skilling, and reflecting best practice in standard operating procedures and processes.  Each Service Level Agreement in place with a Local Authority is supported by an Annual Service Plan which reflects the required programme of transformation for that authority.  Funding under each Annual Service Plan is designed to reimburse the local authority for the costs incurred on water services and staffing levels will be reviewed each year as part of the Annual Service Plan.</p><p>  The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2014 provides an amount of &euro;490m for Irish Water from the Local Government Fund in 2014; the final outturn figure for 2014 is likely to be slightly less than this amount.  This amount provided will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities; these expenditures were previously met by local authorities from their own resources and general purpose grants.  Within this overall framework, the agreement of budgets with local authorities and the payments for services provided are matters for Irish Water.  The Annual Financial Statement of each local authority for 2014 onwards will explicitly detail the cost of services provided to Irish Water and the related payments received in each financial year.</p></reply>

I expect to bring the General Scheme of the Bill to Government for consideration in 2014.  However, as indicated in the Government Legislation Programme published on 15 January 2014, it is not possible at this time to indicate when the Bill will be published, having regard to the broad range of legislative priorities to be progressed across my Department&rsquo;s remit.  Currently, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet, <i>A Guide to the Noise Regulations</i>, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website .</p></reply>

Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each City and County Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements in each Council.  It is a matter for City and County Managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the moratorium is implemented while the appropriate service levels are maintained.  Where a local authority identifies a critical post that it cannot fill by way of re-organisation or re-assignment it may revert to my Department seeking sanction to fill the post. My Department examines all staffing sanction requests on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. In considering sanction requests public safety, maintaining key front line services and economic considerations are given precedence.</p><p>  Dublin City Council recently carried out an assessment of staffing needs for the fire service, and the proposed recruitment procedures were discussed and agreed with trade unions.  Some existing fire-fighter vacancies were filled on a cost neutral basis from within the existing staff cohort of the Dublin local authorities.

In addition to the very strong winds, there were periods of extremely heavy rain and a lot of thunderstorm activity.  These storms coincided with high spring tides and created severe and damaging conditions in a number of coastal areas.</p><p>  On 14 January I brought an Interim Report to Government on the storms, compiled by my Department in its capacity as Lead Government Department for the response to severe weather.  At the request of Government, my Department is seeking more detailed reports from local authorities, to be provided over the coming 2 weeks, on the anticipated repair and recovery works, including related costings.  This will enable Government, through the specific areas of responsibility of relevant Departments and Agencies, to support the local authorities on recovery measures.  In the meantime, Government is exploring all possible sources of funding to meet the costs which have arisen from the storm damage, including contact with the EU about a possible application under the Solidarity Funds programme.  Any Government decision on an application to the Fund will be made once the full cost of damage has been assessed.</p></reply>

On foot of this provision, Part 11 of the prescribed social housing application form seeks information on property ownership in the State and abroad and a household is required, under Regulation 11 of the 2011 Regulations, to provide to the housing authority such additional information, including documents and other particulars, as is sought by the authority for the purpose of verifying information relating to its application for social housing support.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine what is required in individual cases.  My Department would expect that any information sought by a local authority in this regard would be appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of the household concerned.</p></reply>

Details regarding the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website .   </p><p>  The period for public submissions has closed and submissions from a variety of interested parties are now under consideration.  I expect to be in a position to formulate future policy approaches and actions, taking account of the consultation process, in the near future.   </p><p>  In 2013, I asked the Housing Agency to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures.  While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures.  This additional work is underway and I expect to make further recommendations to bring the review process to a conclusion in the near future. </p><p>  Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department recently issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress.  These include clarification on renting of rooms and the announcement of the nationwide extension of the Local Authority Mortgage-to-Rent (LAMTR) scheme following the successful completion of a pilot scheme in two local authority areas.  To support the national rollout of LAMTR, with the support of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Housing Finance Agency, I will be allocating an additional &euro;20m to the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) fund in 2014 to significantly expand the capacity of that resource to assist shared ownership households in mortgage distress.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and equipment. </p><p>  My Department, through the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, engages on an on-going basis with fire authorities to assist them in meeting their statutory responsibilities while also complying with the requirements of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. </p><p>  There are a number of initiatives to ensure that persons working in fire services are properly equipped and trained, have appropriate procedures and are supervised so that, in so far as is reasonably practicable, their safety at work is ensured and local authorities comply with the relevant legislative requirements. My Department has published National Guidance to assist fire authorities to provide consistent and safe training in the use of breathing apparatus.

Although replacement equipment is not generally funded through the capital programme, there are no outstanding requests currently with my Department from the City Council for additional fire appliances or fire fighting equipment.</p></reply>

The <i>Programme for Government</i> sets out a commitment to the introduction of domestic water charges based on usage above a free allowance and to establish Irish Water, a new state company to take responsibility for water services provision. The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.   </p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the delivery of water services from the 34 water services authorities to Irish Water and provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of these water services. The Act also provides for the establishment of an economic regulator for water services within the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  Under the Act, the CER will have the power to set charges for both domestic and non-domestic customers.  The primary role of the CER will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them. </p><p>  Irish Water will be required to have a range of options in place to assist householders who have difficulties in paying their bills. In addition, an inter-Departmental working group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing water poverty and water affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges. The group is to prepare a report for consideration by the Government to enable decisions on the proposed approach to be taken, in advance of proposed public consultation by the CER on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs during 2014.</p></reply>

In 2012, I published, in tandem with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Green Tenders<i>, </i>the national action plan on green public procurement. Green Tenders notifies public authorities both of their existing statutory obligations in terms of the environmental impacts of their procurement activities, and of how they can continually improve on their performance.</p><p>  Green Tenders<i></i>is available to download on my Department&rsquo;s website, . The following extracts are particularly relevant:   </p><p>&ldquo;The Building Energy Rating (BER) methodology should be used to assess new buildings. A BER, which is effectively an energy label, is required at the point of sale or rental of a building. In addition, for public buildings, a further energy rating is documented in an annual Display Energy Certificate (DEC) which shows the actual energy consumed in the building compared to a benchmark on a scale from A1 to G. The DEC is intended to encourage public authorities to adopt environmentally responsible and efficient use of energy in buildings. They will be used to monitor on-going energy use and assess the effect of renovation works and energy management initiatives.</p><p>Since January 2009, public bodies occupying buildings over 1,000m<sup>2</sup> are obliged to exhibit a DEC, in a prominent place, clearly visible to the public. Regulation 15(1) of the European Communities (Energy End-use Efficiency and Energy Services) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 542/2009) requires public bodies to only purchase or lease buildings with a BER of B3 or higher (from 1 January 2012) and A3 or higher (from 1 January 2015), unless specified exemptions are invoked. In addition, the European Communities (Renewable Energy) Regulations 2011 require public bodies to fulfil an exemplary role (in the context of Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources) when constructing or renovating public buildings after December 31st, 2011.&rdquo;   </p><p>  In terms of mitigating carbon emissions arising from buildings in State ownership, it is expected that energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy will play a key role. Policy development and implementation in relation to energy efficiency and renewable energy are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The Office of Public Works also has relevant functions in relation to ownership, management and efficiency of State buildings. </p></reply>

It was agreed by the Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform programme that, to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in asset management, capital delivery and operations would be restricted to staff in the partner organisations i.e. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, local authorities and my Department in the first instance. Open competitions are held for all other positions and details of these are available on Irish Water&rsquo;s website . </p><p>  Data supplied by Irish Water indicates that at present 310 staff appointments have been made in Irish Water. The breakdown of these staff in terms of their employment immediately before recruitment is as follows: 59 were recruited from Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann; 107 from Local Authorities; 5 from my Department and the balance, 139, were externally recruited.   </p><p>  In addition to the staff employed directly in Irish Water, one hundred people are directly employed on the National domestic water metering programme and 871 people have been employed through Regional Contractors on that programme. The Irish Water Call Centre employs 44 people.   </p><p>  Neither Irish Water nor the Metering Programme have employed anyone under the JobBridge programme. However, a social inclusion commitment formed part of the regional management contractors&rsquo; contracts with Irish Water and included requirements for a defined percentage of people working on the domestic water metering programme to be drawn from SMEs, the unemployment register, apprentices, graduates or school leavers. </p><p>  The employment terms and conditions for Irish Water staff are a matter for the company and I understand that these are in line the arrangements applying with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann. I also understand that no bonuses have been paid to Irish Water staff, but I have asked the company set out the basis and content of the model as applied to Irish Water contracts of employment, including the criteria against which high performance will be evaluated and the kinds of targets (at company and division or grade levels) against which such performance may be bench-marked. The management of facilities including Headquarter and regional offices is an operational matter for the company and one in which I have no role.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.     </p><p>  Under the 2008 fire service capital programme, a proposal by Kilkenny County Council to build a new two bay fire station in Grauigenamanagh was approved in principle.  The Council was subsequently approved to prepare detailed design and tender documents in relation to the project. These have been received in my Department for consideration.  Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as one of the key national priorities for the fire services capital programme. In that context and in order to deliver cost efficiencies, a programme involving fire authorities aggregating demand and jointly procuring 17 fire appliances is now nearing completion, under which Kilkenny Fire and Rescue Service has received an allocation for a new appliance which is under construction.   </p><p>  Given the constraints on public finances, further support from my Department&rsquo;s fire services capital programme to replace Grauigenamanagh fire station will have regard to national priorities, the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide, Kilkenny County Council&rsquo;s priorities, the extent of previous investment in Kilkenny fire service, the value for money offered by proposals and the status of existing facilities having regard to risk categorisation.</p><p>  In 2013, I published a policy document titled: <i>Keeping Communities Safe</i> (KCS), which sets the future direction of fire services in Ireland.  This is intended to ensure that Ireland continues to manage its fire risk effectively and that the downward trend in the level of fire loss recorded annually continues. KCS includes, inter alia, the re-alignment of structures to deliver effective fire services.  This provides for fire services to remain as a local authority function, but service delivery is to be reshaped from the current 30 fire services to 21, with 14 single fire authorities and 7 &lsquo;shared services&rsquo;.  Carlow / Kilkenny is included among the &lsquo;shared services&rsquo;.  </p><p>  There is significant experience among fire authorities of delivering aspects of their services on a &lsquo;shared service&rsquo; basis. This experience, coupled with the work already underway to integrate fire services in Tipperary, Limerick and Waterford, will provide a solid basis for developing an appropriate model of shared services for fire authorities, based on populations in the range of 120,000 to 200,000.  </p></reply>

Any person who applied for a grant prior to January 2014 will have their application processed in accordance with the guidelines in place at that time. These applicants will not be affected by the changes to the terms of the schemes. </p><p>  The changes were made on foot of the report of a review group, established last year by my Department, to examine the terms and conditions governing the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability. Membership of the group included members of both the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA), the Housing Practitioner Network, Local Authority housing personnel and officials from my Department. Consultations were held with organisations working with older people and people with a disability, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, ALONE, HSE, Ataxia Ireland, the Irish Society for Autism and the National Disability Authority. The aim of the review was to spread the benefits of the schemes as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in their operation.   </p><p>  There has been no change to the maximum grant available under the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability which remains at &euro;30,000 or the Mobility Aids Grant which remains at &euro;6,000. In the case of the Housing Aid for Older People, the maximum grant has been reduced from &euro;10,500 to &euro;8,000. The average grant paid under this scheme in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was &euro;4,162, &euro;4,106 and &euro;3,995 respectively, well below the maximum available. The age limit for eligibility has been increased from 60 to 66 years. However, a lower age limit may apply at the discretion of the local authority in certain cases.   </p><p>  Changes have also been made with regard to the assessment of means of applicants. To bring it into line with the means assessment for applicants for social housing, all household members&rsquo; income, with certain exceptions, will be included in the assessment of means.  The level of income beyond which no grant is payable has been reduced from &euro;65,000 to &euro;60,000. In the case of an applicant where a household member is aged under 65, there is no impact on grant eligibility.  However, where appropriate their income will be taken into account in accessing household income. </p><p>  I have increased the level of funding available for the grant schemes by 12% in 2014 to &euro;38.4 million. Every local authority has increased funding for grants compared to the initial allocation in 2013. The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment, approval and payment of grants to applicants under the various grant measures, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. The terms and conditions of the schemes must be applied uniformly and consistently across all local authority areas.</p></reply>

The Government also decided that the question of whether the role of Irish Water should be assigned to an existing State Agency merited further analysis with a view to ensuring that existing resources and capabilities in the State sector were used to best effect.</p><p>  This further analysis was undertaken by a team comprising my Department and NewERA, in consultation with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The process involved an assessment of the capacity and capabilities of a number of State agencies from amongst those identified in the independent assessment as having the potential to incorporate a new water utility. The process involved the making of detailed submissions and presentations by Bord na M&oacute;na and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann based on identified capabilities required for the establishment and operation of Irish Water.</p><p>  The outcome of the analysis was that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord G&aacute;is Group as they had key capabilities which could be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water. This included experience in operating as a utility in a regulated environment and a track record in raising finance, and specific skills from its own experience of transformation, customer relations, network management, metering and utility operation that could be quickly deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water. The decision reflected an understanding that specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise in local government and the Department would also be brought to bear in building the new organisation.</p></reply>

My Department continues to fund this work and will provide support for the ongoing remediation of the site again in 2014. The EPA signed a contract on 27 February 2013 for the provision of site management services and for the development of an options report for the future remediation of the site. This Kerdiffstown Landfill Remediation Project Remedial Options Report, which is vital to ensuring that the best technical, environmental and most cost-effective solution for the site is chosen, was finalised in July. The EPA then carried out a consultation process on the report with the local community and elected representatives. Following examination of the report options and feedback from the consultation process, the EPA has very recently written to my Department with advice on its recommended course of action.   Taking cognisance of this advice, I will shortly bring a recommended course of action to Government for approval.</p></reply>

On foot of this commitment I asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to commission research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations in that regard. The subsequent report assessed a number of different options for delivery of a deposit protection scheme ranging from one where all elements are delivered by the PRTB to one where all elements are outsourced to a private operator. Each option was considered in terms of both insurance and custodial type schemes. </p><p>  I have considered all of the options presented in the report in order to determine how to offer the greatest protection to tenants at least cost to the Exchequer. I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly on the establishment of a tenancy deposit scheme with a view to introducing provisions for such a scheme in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 at Committee stage.

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing this year, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund, as General Purpose Grants. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector has a considerable impact on local authority financing.</p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014. Service provision responsibilities are moving from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure is being transferred, financing arrangements have altered and local authorities are operating on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements. These changes must be managed.</p><p>  In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allowed maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with a priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. In allocating general purpose funding for 2014 I have sought to ensure, in combination with the funding being made available through Irish Water, that these elements of support for local authorities would be maintained around 2013 levels. It will be a matter for each local authority to determine how best to use General Purpose Grant revenue in line with local priorities and circumstances.</p><p>  The <i>Revised Estimates</i><i>Volume</i><i>for Public Services 2014</i>   provides   an amount of &euro;490m for   Irish Water from the Local Government Fund in 2014 ; the final outturn figure for 2014 is likely to be slightly less than this amount. This amount provided will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities ; these expenditures were previously met by local authorities from their own resources and   general purpose grants.</p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p></reply>

There is a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat through a suite of schemes. A community organisation may qualify for inclusion under one or more of these schemes, should it meet the terms and conditions of a particular scheme managed by my Department.</p><p>  Pobal, a not-for-profit organisation , manages a significant proportion of th is funding on behalf of my Department under both the Local Community and Development Programme (LCDP) and Dormant Accounts Measures.</p><p>  In addition , my Department also provides funding directly to a number of other organisations under the Local and Community Development Programme and the Seniors Alert Scheme and recoups to local authorities costs associated with the provision of accommodation and related services by voluntary housing bodies.     Summary details of the main Community and Voluntary Schemes follow.</p><p>  The LCDP is one of my Department&rsquo;s main social inclusion programmes, aimed at tacklling poverty and social exclusion in disadvantaged communities. It is a key tool of Government in providing employment supports, training, personal development/capacity building and other supports for the harder to reach in the most disadvantaged areas in society. There are 50 Local Development Companies (LDCs) contracted through Pobal on my Department&rsquo;s behalf to deliver the LCDP, with 35 of those also delivering the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) throughout the country.</p><p>  The funding Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary sector provides multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services. Priority is given under the Scheme to supporting national organisations which provide coalface services to disadvantaged target groups. My Department also provides annual funding to members of the Community and Voluntary Pillar, to support costs, not funded from any other sources, directly related to the organisations&rsquo; contribution to policy-making in a social partnerships context.</p><p>  My Department funds a network of twenty one Volunteer Centres, who act as &lsquo;brokers&rsquo; between potential volunteers and organisations seeking volunteers. They also work with organisations to develop their volunteer management capacity and carry out Garda vetting for smaller organisations. The Department also provides funding to Volunteer Ireland, the national volunteer development agency and a number of other organisations that promote volunteering. The focus of Volunteer Ireland is to create an enabling environment for volunteering, to develop an ethos of volunteerism across all sectors of society and to be an independent and legitimate voice for volunteering.</p><p>  The Seniors Alert Scheme is a community-based initiative that promotes independent living for older people in their own homes.

A variety of routes to registration are provided for in the Act, including specific provision (under section 22) for the registration of persons who had been performing duties commensurate with those of an architect for a period of 10 or more years in the State prior to the commencement of the Act of 2007.</p><p>  In 2013, in response in particular to the concerns of those who felt that fewer applications have been made to date by persons who may be eligible to seek inclusion on the register in accordance with Section 22, I asked Mr Garret Fennell , Solicitor, who is currently serving as the Chairperson of the Admissions Board relevant to the register of Architects, to carry out an independent review of the experience to date in relation to the operation of the register with a view to identifying any further improvements that can be made at this point.   </p><p>  Following the publication of Mr Fennell&rsquo;s report on the matter last year, I understand that the RIAI, the designated registration body under Part 3 of the Act of 2007, has already made a number of modifications to the technical assessment process. My Department, in conjunction with the RIAI as registration body, will be happy to liaise with interested parties such as the Architects Alliance of Ireland in relation to the on-going development of registration arrangements in line with the recommendations made by Mr Fennell or as otherwise reasonable and appropriate.</p></reply>

I have also recently received sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to appoint an interim CEO and a number of other staff from within existing resources. I intend to have these staff in place by the end of February to enable the new Authority to carry out the necessary preparatory work before coming formally into operation later this year.</p><p>  An early priority for the new Authority will be the preparation and publication of a statutory register of charities. All registered charities will be required to provide reports to the Authority each year on their activities and these reports will be made available to the public. This will provide a much needed increase in transparency and accountability in the charitable sector, and will support the good practice in charity governance and management that is critical to a vibrant charity sector that commands the trust and confidence of donors and beneficiaries alike.</p></reply>

As its title indicates, the aim of the new Bill is to establish a system within which gambling can take place openly, fairly and in accordance with terms and conditions, in other words, within a controlled environment. The Bill will operate on the basis that all gambling is illegal unless it is of a type permitted by law and, even if permitted, it may be carried on only if licensed and in compliance with any terms and conditions attached to the licence. </p><p>  This approach ensures that all operators wishing to provide services to the public must make themselves known to the authorities. The authorities can then ensure the operators are suitable and are operating within the law. As a result, the risk of gambling being used for criminal activity will be greatly reduced and consumers will be afforded a high degree of protection. </p><p>  The new controls will operate in several ways and at different stages. For example, to begin with, all applicants for licences must supply detailed information about themselves, their past records (whether in Ireland or abroad), and about their businesses. The information must include details of all convictions (in Ireland or elsewhere). </p><p>  Where licences are granted, a dedicated inspectorate will ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licence and with the new legislation generally.  The legislation will provide that the inspectorate must include persons qualified in all the disciplines required for the inspection of gambling operations and venues. The inspectorate will be able to bring prosecutions or may impose administrative sanctions in appropriate cases. </p><p>  There will be controls directed particularly at unlicensed operators, and in particular, at remote operators, many of whom will be based outside the State. The regulator will be able to apply for Court Orders to prevent, disrupt or obstruct receipt of the unlicensed service; these Orders will result in what is commonly referred to as &quot;blocking&quot; of the website.  The Orders may also restrict publicity, including advertising that refers in any way to the service, as well as prohibiting banks from executing financial transactions with the unlicensed operator.  </p><p>  The Bill will facilitate enhanced cooperation arrangements at international level between regulators. These arrangements will enable exchanges of information between our authorities and their counterparts abroad. This will give the Irish authorities access to very wide and  rich information on operators and it can be used to verify statements or claims made to the Irish authorities. </p><p>  As can be seen, the Bill will provide a varied and comprehensive set of measures to address illegal gambling. </p><p>  The Bill is being prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is expected to be published in early 2015. Meanwhile, the general scheme of the Bill is available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The granting of aid is a matter for the court.</p><p>  A new computer system was introduced in the Financial Shared Services of the Department in 2006 and it is only possible to provide figures in the format sought from 2006 onwards.

However, in 2013 I managed to secure additional funding for the Scheme from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by way of supplementary estimate which permitted the Tribunal to pay the overwhelming majority of awards, both outstanding and current, in full.

I understand that no court venue was singled out for or indeed exempted from the review process.  There are significant costs in operating and maintaining an extensive estate of properties around the country, both in terms of the staff who must attend these locations, and the cost of maintaining the buildings themselves and providing appropriate facilities in them. In allocating resources the Courts Service has indicated that it must prioritise venues that are regularly used and that have the highest workload.</p><p>  During the course of 2012, the Courts Service completed a comprehensive review of all venues throughout the country. The purpose of the review was to establish a framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking account of a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc. The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue. The Courts Service has indicated that the identification of venues as part of the review process will not necessarily mean that the identified venues will close.</p><p>  I am informed that following the aforementioned review courthouses located at Killorglin, Caherciveen, Kenmare and Dingle were identified as venues which should be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case. The Courts Service has indicated that it undertook substantive consultation processes with local interests, including the Kerry Law Society, and that submissions and views received will be fully considered as part of the ongoing decision making process. I am informed that if closure of a venue is to be recommended to the Board following the ongoing detailed assessment then all those previously consulted will be afforded another opportunity to make further submissions to the Board. However, the final decision in relation to the closure of any venue is a matter for the Board of the Courts Service and I have no role in that regard. </p></reply>

I will, therefore, reiterate my views on this occasion.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 does not make any provision in relation to the role or status of &quot;legal executives&quot; nor is any such provision envisaged. Any extension of the scope of the Bill beyond that of &quot;legal practitioners&quot; as so defined in terms of practising solicitors or barristers would have to be considered separately at some future time if it were ever to become an agreed policy or legislative objective. Moreover, it must be acknowledged that while legal executives have a range of recognised functions they are not a homogenous group and tend to provide support in discrete areas of legal practise such as those of conveyancing, probate, commercial or family proceedings and to have a range of personal qualifications appropriate to performing the respective legal tasks concerned.  As set out on the web-site of the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd. in regard to such legal executives, &quot;he/she is often entrusted with the practicalities of progressing a given legal transaction initiated by the practitioner&quot;. In very many instances, therefore, it is those Solicitors or other legal practitioners who are the principals of the legal practices or firms concerned who ultimately carry responsibility for the actions of their employee legal executives, including under the relevant legislative provisions and professional codes.</p><p>  It is clear from the correspondence I have received from the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd. that the scope of their proposals to confer legal status and a whole range of functions on such a category of persons is extensive and goes way beyond their current functions and those measures to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  They relate <i>inter alia</i>  to &quot;a right of audience in the District and Circuit Courts, before tribunals and, subject to review, subsequently in all courts&quot;, and to the eligibility of members for quasi-judicial and judicial appointments (e.g as District Court judges or members of Tribunals). These proposals also draw heavily from the  regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which have separate and very distinct histories and do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. As such, they are premature in a number of key respects and give rise to a  range of substantive issues that cannot be addressed, in legislative terms, by merely adding a handful of provisions to this Bill.</p><p>  While recognising that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for &quot;legal executives&quot; in the future, the very far-reaching proposals being made on their behalf at this time lie beyond the scope of the Legal Services Regulation Bill impinging, as they do, on aspects of the courts and the judiciary.  Such proposals, including their constitutional and other substantive aspects, will need to be considered carefully and separately on their own merits at some future time if they are ever to become matters of determined Government policy for implementation. Others, including that of the profession of conveyancer, will come to be considered in due course by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. As recognised by the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd, based on the experience of its own members, it nonetheless remains open to legal executives, who are so minded, to pursue other careers such as those of Commissioner for Oaths or solicitor or barrister by way of capitalising on their acquired legal knowledge, qualifications and experience.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is implementing a range of initiatives to tackle metal theft, in line with the framework set out in the plan, and have my full support in this regard.  Garda enforcement measures include activity under the aegis of Operation Fiacla and, as the Deputy will be aware, since the introduction of that operation there have been substantial reductions in burglary nationwide.  </p><p>  In so far as the question of the regulations which apply in this area, and the possible sale of stolen metal is concerned, my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government has published draft regulations under the Waste Management Act which aim to enhance the traceability of scrap metal purchases, and I am advised that this proposal remains under consideration. </p></reply>

Ireland contributes to CSDP civil and military missions, and participates in co-operative arrangements within the EU for the development and delivery of military capabilities, including through active engagement in the European Defence Agency.  We have been a strong supporter of the role taken by the European Defence Agency in relation to the development and delivery of capabilities for CSDP operations and its role in supporting the development of a more competitive and efficient defence industry, which could reduce the cost of equipment procurement to the Defence Forces.  To this end, Ireland has participated in a range of EDA programmes, including on Force Protection, Maritime Surveillance and Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear protection.  </p><p>  In 2010, the EDA embarked on a new initiative in the area of co-operative military capability development called &quot;Pooling and Sharing&quot;.  The concept involves groups of Member States coming together and pooling resources so as to retain, maintain and/or enhance their military capabilities which they can make available for Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations.  Ireland is currently participating in a pooling and sharing initiative, taking the lead role in a study on Naval Training which is examining the potential for pooling and sharing training across the 11 participating member States.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in co-operative military capability development initiatives is designed to develop and enhance the capabilities of the Defence Forces on crisis management operations and to deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness in this regard.  None of these initiatives impose any obligations on Ireland and we retain the right to determine when and where we will co-operate on such initiatives.  </p><p>  In relation to the issue of a European Union Common Defence, the position of the Government is clear.  Article 29.4.9 of the Constitution specifically prohibits participation by the State in a European common defence.  There is also a significant legal underpinning for Ireland&rsquo;s view on the defence aspects of the EU, which is reflected in Title III of the Protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon.  Any decision by Ireland to participate in an EU Common Defence would be a matter for the people to decide.    </p></reply>

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995.      </p><p>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service;</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years;</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks.  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p><p>  It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association as soon as possible in 2014.</p></reply>

I have been actively assessing the damage to the many small Local Authority piers and harbours right around the coast. I am aware of the critical importance of this local pier and harbour infrastructure to the 1900 odd inshore fishing vessels that provide a backbone to our inshore fishing fleet.</p><p>  The Government in considering the totality of the impact of the storms decided that the Local Authorities need to do a full assessment of the damage and the costs involved and should revert to Government in the coming weeks. That comprehensive assessment will then enable Government to decide on a fully informed response to the damage that was wreaked on our coastal communities as a result of these exceptionally bad storms.</p><p>  On the specific issue of Government support for inshore fishermen for losses of equipment or boats, it is useful to recall that there are a range of grant aid schemes already available to inshore fishermen, which are administered by BIM. </p><p>  There have been some reports in the media about the loss, by some inshore fishermen, of their pots. It is not unusual for inshore fishermen to experience some pot losses through the winter. It is too early to fully determine the scale of the losses and if these were widespread.  I will in the coming days be endeavouring to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.</p><p>  In deciding on an appropriate response to the situation that emerges I will have to take account of the fact that EU Law limits the options. The EU requires that any financial assistance provided by Government to the seafood sector must always be considered in terms of what is permissible under EU State Aid rules.  It is clear that under State Aid rules no aid may be given for the replacement of any lost or damaged fishing boats.  </p><p>  In relation to pots, the European Fisheries Fund Regulation does allow for financial assistance for purchase of pots but only where the replacement pots provide for more selectivity in relation to by-catch and under size fish.  Any such assistance to purchase fishing gear may not increase the ability of a vessel to catch fish and would be difficult to implement without the risk of breaching State Aid rules.  </p><p>  However, while all of these constraints and considerations exist, I am still endeavouring to get a full picture of the situation and when that is to hand I will be in a better position to inform Government and determine what responses are practical and appropriate.</p></reply>

The scheme provides for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers, and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging environmental actions. The proposed minimum contract is five years.  The outline of the GLAS Scheme, details of which have been published in the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014 -2020 Draft Consultation Programme, is now subject to further consultation with various stakeholders.  Following that process, formal proposals will be drafted for submission to the European Commission.

REPS 4 is a measure under the current 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue.  In order to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme, each participant is required to have all their lands farmed declared on the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) and include all IACS/Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) numbers and land areas in the REPS Agri-environmental Plan.  The person named failed to make an IACS declaration in relation to 2011 and 2012 which rendered their participation in REPS ineligible for the years in question and was informed of this situation.  The person named sought a review of this decision and this appeal was unsuccessful.  He was afforded the opportunity to appeal the case to the Agriculture Appeal&rsquo;s Office.  To-date no appeal has been received.  In the absence of a valid IACS application for the specified years my Department is not in a position to make a payment under REPS.</p></reply>

An unannounced inspection of a high support unit (HSU) in the Health Service Executive, Dublin North East (HSE DNE) was carried out on 1 - 2 October 2013.  Of the eight recommendations made in the previous inspection, inspectors found that seven had either been completed or were ongoing and one recommendation, in relation to the development of a programme of works to ensure the structural and decorative order of the centre, had been partly completed.   The inspection stated that there continued to be a good standard of care provided to children and that there was a committed management team and motivated staff group who were ensuring the delivery of a child centred service.</p><p>  The report noted that the external door of the unit was locked from 8pm to 8am in an attempt to stop children leaving the unit at night.  Inspectors found that children were at risk when in the community at night.  The report also noted that the unit should not lock its external door as it was not a secure unit.  Inspectors also had some concerns regarding fire drills and safety.   The Report notes that the HSU staff team were providing a service to some children who required a different resource to meet their needs in terms of their high risk behaviours.  Such children were found to be not suitably placed in an open residential setting at this time.  The Child and Family Agency will continue to engage with other statutory services to address the needs of these children.  This HIQA Inspection Report highlights the need to provide additional Special Care placements.  There is a capital development programme already underway which will double our capacity to 34 beds in 2016.  The HSU has outlined an Action Plan which is published within the Inspection Report.  This plan reflects the ongoing monitoring of areas where practice and systems need further development and where actions are required to enhance compliance with all standards.  The CFA has advised that these improvements have already commenced or are ongoing with key actions to implement a robust risk management system.</p></reply>

Standards of Care provision are constantly under review by a designated Monitoring Officer specifically assigned to this role.  Children are place in Special Care under the jurisdiction of the High Court and all cases are reviewed on a monthly basis by the High Court.  These Units are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) with the level of care being provided in the three Special Care Units having been endorsed by the most recent 2012 HIQA reports.</p><p>  The Agency has informed me it is currently implementing a capital development programme for Special Care services in order to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet the needs of children requiring this specialised type of Care.  The first phase of the programme is underway with improvements to facilities in Dublin completed and the extensive refurbishment of the Unit in Limerick also complete.  Planning is well underway for phase 2 of the programme which will double the capacity of the service to 34 beds in early 2016.</p><p>  The need to provide Special Care placements outside the jurisdiction into the future cannot be avoided in a very small number of cases in order to ensure the best interests of some children with specialised additional needs.  The referral of children abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system and decisions in each case are made in the best interests of the individual.</p><p>  The Units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and the Agency is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised Units.  The level of requirement of these services for children is closely monitored by the Agency.  Currently there are 17 children in placement in Special Care in HSE Units and 10 children are placed abroad on the basis of High Court Detention Orders. </p><p>  ACTS (Assessment, Consultation, Therapeutic Services)  is a new national specialised clinical service which is being developed by the Agency to provide multidisciplinary consultation, assessment and focused interventions to young people who have high risk behaviours associated with complex clinical needs.  These therapeutic inputs are provided in a flexible, timely and responsive manner with a focus on improving outcomes for young people and their families.</p><p>  ACTS also supports other professionals in their ongoing work with young people and their families.  This includes on-site therapeutic services to the national high support, special care units and the children detention schools.  It also provides assessment, consultation and focused intervention services in the community for children at risk of placement in high support, special care or detention.</p><p>  ACTS is a multidisciplinary service which includes psychology, social work, speech and language therapy, counselling and social care.  It is supported by contractual sessions from child and forensic psychiatry.  ACTS is led by a management team consisting of the national manager and three heads of discipline whose central responsibility is the implementation of systems of clinical governance.  This is done through effective planning, implementation and evaluation of treatment programmes and protocol driven interventions.  It also involves the provision of high quality clinical supervision and monitoring of professional development needs of staff.  ACTS is based in Dublin with regional clinics in Cork and Limerick.</p></reply>

The nearest available resources, a rapid response vehicle with an advanced paramedic and an emergency ambulance, both in Letterkenny, were dispatched.  As is standard procedure, the NAS also contacted the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, but no emergency resources were available. The response vehicle and ambulance arrived in 40 and 43 minutes respectively.  A second ambulance from Letterkenny arrived in 50 minutes.  The NAS also requested North West Doc and a local GP to provide treatment to the patient, and they were on scene when the NAS crews arrived.  The patient was transported to Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry, arriving at 19.15. </p><p>  The NAS has reviewed this call and is satisfied that the call was triaged correctly and that the nearest available resources were dispatched.  At the time the call was received there was a high level of utilisation of emergency resources.  In an effort to deal with such situations going forward, the NAS has established an escalation process with Letterkenny General Hospital to ensure that Ambulance Control at Ballyshannon is informed at the earliest opportunity of any capacity, activity or other challenges that may affect NAS service delivery.  </p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority as part of its Business Plan for 2014, and in line with its programme for the monitoring of the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare, will review the governance and management arrangements of pre-hospital emergency care services to include the timely call-handling, response, assessment, diagnosis, care and transportation of the acutely ill patient to the appropriate healthcare facility.  This review had been due to commence in the 2nd quarter of 2014.  However, in light of a number of recent incidents, the Authority has agreed to my request to commence the review in quarter 1.  I understand that the review will focus initially on the governance arrangements for the service and how those arrangements translate into the safety, quality and effectiveness of services for patients. </p><p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that the NAS will undertake its own capacity review to determine current and future service delivery needs.  This process will examine a number of areas, including staff numbers and skill mix, as well as resource distribution.</p></reply>

Each agency has been asked to confirm by 31 January that they will sign up to the Compliance Statement process.  This statement will have to be approved by the Board of each Agency on an annual basis, signed by the Chairman and another Director on behalf of the Board and submitted to the HSE together with the organisation&rsquo;s Annual Audited Accounts.  This Annual Compliance Statement will be required in addition to the annual Service Agreement between the Agency and the HSE.  </p><p>  Senior HSE managers have met and will have further meetings with all of the disability organisations and hospitals concerned to ensure that they develop a clear plan to achieve full compliance with health sector pay policy and it is important that due process is followed.</p><p>I welcome Minister Shatter&rsquo;s announcement that the Charities Regulatory Authority will be established by Easter.  The new Authority will establish a statutory register of charities and registered charities will be required to provide reports of their activities to the Authority on an annual basis.  These reports will be made available to the public.  The establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority will provide a much needed increase in transparency and accountability in the charity sector which is absolutely necessary to help rebuild trust and confidence in the sector.    </p></reply>

The Act is being reviewed at present in line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government to review the Act "informed by human rights standards and in consultation with service users, carers and other stakeholders".</p><p>  The review is a two phased approach, the first phase of which saw a Steering Group produce an Interim Report in June of 2012.  The recommendations of the Interim Review have been well received by key stakeholders and fully endorsed the rights based approach to mental health law in addition to supporting the objectives of 'A Vision for Change' especially in relation to the promotion of community based mental health services.  Changes to limit the number of people detained and to improve procedures and safeguards regarding their detention were also recommended and the need to strengthen provisions relating to children was also emphasised.</p><p>  An Expert Group was subsequently set up in August 2012 to carry out the second and substantive phase of the review and to look at the recommendations of the Interim Report in more detail.  The main issues being addressed by the Expert Group include the need to move away from the paternalistic nature of the Act and the need for greater protections for individuals who are involuntarily detained which also include capacity, consent, criteria for detention and the promotion of a recovery based approach.  The Expert Group have also been guided by the need to ensure the Act is fully compliant with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and have also taken into consideration the publication of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill.  The Expert Group has met on a total of ten occasions.  I look forward to receiving the Expert Group's report in the coming months and, on receipt, I will be considering its recommendations.</p></reply>

There are no plans to alter these arrangements.</p><p>  The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure.  These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels.  A major new deal on the cost of originator drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including, significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states and these are the maximum prices paid by the HSE for originator drugs supplied through the community drug schemes.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.</p><p>  A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the maximum price at which the HSE reimburses generic products is 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;148 million in 2014.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides that from June 2013 the maximum price of all new medicinal products reimbursed under the community drug schemes will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act.  The Act also provides that the HSE must review all items currently reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes (including prices) within three years to determine if they should remain on the reimbursement list and, if so, what price should apply.  In addition, the Act introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.  It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.</p><p>  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines.  Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State.  The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August 2013.  The List has been updated since then by the addition of 10 more groups of medicines.  The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of the top 20 priority medicines by end Quarter 1 2014.  A second list of 20 priority products will then be identified and it is expected the IMB will have completed assessment of these products in Quarter 4 2014.  The process will then continue until all relevant medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.</p><p>  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products is published by the IMB a two stage price reduction process gets underway.  First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1 September 2013.  Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts.  Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013 and the second reference price for esomeprazole 20mg products was implemented on 1 January 2014.  The HSE also expect to implement reference prices for esomeprazole 40mg and rosuvastatin products with effect from 1st February 2014.</p><p>  In addition, the consultation process is also underway in relation to three more groups of medicines which have been designated as interchangeable by the IMB &ndash; Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, and Pravastatin.  It is expected that reference prices will be implemented for these groups of medicines with effect from 1 March 2014.  The HSE will continue the process of setting reference prices for the remaining groups of interchangeable medicinal products published by the IMB in accordance with the processes and timelines set down in the legislation.  It is expected that 80% by value of the off-patent market for prescribed medicines will be subject to reference pricing by end 2014.  Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p></reply>

As such the harms caused by smoking are well established and my Department has not commissioned any research in this area in the years referred to by the Deputy.  In relation to the heath expenditure on campaigns to encourage and assist people to stop smoking, I understand from the HSE that in respect of their QUIT social marketing campaign that &euro;850,000 was spent in 2012 and &euro;1.07m in 2013.  The costs associated with the campaign in 2014 have not yet been finalised.</p><p>  In addition to this there are other existing measures aimed at warning people about the harms of tobacco and encouraging smokers to quit the habit.  In 2012 I developed regulations for the introduction of graphic warnings on cigarette packs which came into effect in 2013.  Research and experience in other countries has shown that health warnings combined with coloured photographs can be an effective means of discouraging smoking and informing people about the health risks related to smoking.  In relation to educating children and young people about the harms of smoking, the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum incorporates a smoking component.  For those who seek support, smoking cessation services are provided nationally by the HSE, the National Smokers' QUIT-line provides telephone support together with the QUIT website and QUIT Facebook page and nicotine replacement therapies are available free of charge on GMS prescriptions.</p></reply>

There has been a general price freeze in operation in Ireland for medicines supplied under the community drug schemes since the mid 1990's. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels.</p><p>  Price increases have only been allowed under the national pricing agreements in exceptional circumstances.  Approximately 60 products have been granted price increases since 2006. Included in this are essential medicines such as epilepsy medicines and corticosteroids. Price increases are only allowed in extremis  to maintain supplies of required medicines in the Irish market and require the provision of detailed supporting evidence including international pricing.  </p><p>  In relation to hydrocortisone, it is appreciated that for an individual patient, the increase in its price is substantial. However, if an increase had not been agreed, the manufacturer was insistent that it would remove the product from the Irish market. If that had occurred, patients would have had to pay for an even more expensive unlicensed product. There is still only a single supplier of hydrocortisone in the Irish market, which suggests that the HSE made the right decision in allowing the price increase in order to maintain supply.</p><p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p><p>  The Government is committed to reducing both the State&rsquo;s drugs bill and the cost to individuals of their medicines. The Programme for Government therefore gave a commitment to the introduction of reference pricing and the increased use of generics.  </p><p>  A number of steps have been taken on foot of this commitment, including: a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including, significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future. The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states.</p><p>The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.</p><p>  A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the HSE only  reimburses generic products which are priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;148 million in 2014.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides that from June 2013 the price of all new medicinal products reimbursed under the community drug schemes will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act. The Act also provides that the HSE must review all items currently reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes (including prices) within three years to determine if they should remain on the reimbursement list and, if so, what price should apply. In addition, the Act introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients. It is estimated that this system will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013 and the second reference price for esomeprazole 20mg products was implemented on 1 January 2014 resulting in price reductions of 70% and 56% respectively compared to May 2013 price.</p><p>  The HSE expect to implement reference prices for esomeprazole 40mg and rosuvastatin products with effect from 1 February 2014. In addition, the consultation process is also underway in relation to three more groups of medicines which have been designated as interchangeable by the IMB &ndash; Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, and Pravastatin. It is expected that reference prices will be implemented for these groups of medicines with effect from 1 March 2014. The HSE will continue the process of setting reference prices for the remaining groups of interchangeable medicinal products published by the IMB in accordance with the processes and timelines set down in the legislation. It is expected that 80% by value of the off-patent market for prescribed medicines will be subject to reference pricing by end 2014. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p></reply>

Minimum benefit is one of the key principles on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. </p><p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women.  By way of example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women). Importantly, under Community Rating everybody is charged the same premium for any specific health insurance plan available on the market, irrespective of their age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health, and the plan purchased will include this minimum suite of benefits.  </p><p>  Therefore, the broad base line of procedures provided by minimum benefit should not be looked at in gender specific or age-related terms, but rather as a cohort of benefits and procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.</p></reply>

Clinical Status 1 ECHO calls involve life-threatening emergencies of cardiac or respiratory origin.  Clinical Status 1 DELTA calls involve life-threatening emergencies of other than cardiac or respiratory origin. </p><p>  Since they were introduced in 2011, the HSE has been implementing the HIQA response time standards on a phased basis, in tandem with planned service improvements.  In 2013, NAS exceeded the National Service Plan response time target for ECHO calls of 70% of patient-carrying vehicles on scene within 18 minutes 59 seconds.  The DELTA response time performance was however 4% below the national target of 68%.  In 2014, the targets have increased to 80% for both call types.</p><p>  It is acknowledged that sole reliance on response times to measure performance is restrictive and a poor reflection of ambulance service work.  Therefore, in line with many other jurisdictions, we are working to develop clinical outcome indicators for pre-hospital emergency responses.  The first outcome indicator, for the return of spontaneous circulation in the Emergency Department in 40% of certain out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, has been introduced in the 2014 Service Plan. </p><p>  HIQA, as part of its Business Plan for 2014, and in line with its programme for the monitoring of the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare, will review the governance and management arrangements of pre-hospital emergency care services to include the timely call-handling, response, assessment, diagnosis, care and transportation of the acutely ill patient to the appropriate healthcare facility.  This review had been due to commence in the 2nd quarter of 2014; however, in light of a number of recent incidents, the Authority has agreed to my request to commence the review in quarter 1.  I understand that the review will focus initially on the governance arrangements for the service and how those arrangements translate into the safety, quality and effectiveness of services for patients. </p><p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that the National Ambulance Service will undertake its own capacity review to determine current and future service delivery needs.  This process will examine a number of areas, including staff numbers and skill mix, as well as resource distribution.</p><p>  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the specific information requested.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees.  This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure. </p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation which is being drafted.  The Department and the HSE are currently considering the changes that need to be made to the GMS contract to facilitate the roll-out of GP services free to all children aged 5 and under.</p><p>  Under the existing medical card and GP visit card contracts, it is always open to GPs to choose to participate or not and similar arrangements will apply under the new legislation.

Line Units within the Department with governance responsibility for individual agencies meet regularly throughout the year with the agencies to monitor compliance.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) funds a range of service providers under section 38 or section 39 of the Health Act 2004. The staff in bodies funded under Section 38 of the Health Act, 2004 are classified as public servants and are subject to the standard salary scales for the health sector as well as having public service pension schemes and being counted in public service employment numbers. Employees of organisations that receive grants from the HSE under Section 39 - the organisations referred to by the Deputy - are not public servants and are not specifically subject to the salary scales approved for public servants.</p><p>  However, at my request, the HSE wrote to the CEOs of the 353 Section 39 funded agencies in receipt of HSE funding of more than &euro;250,000 on the 10th December, 2013 asking them to have due regard for overall Government pay policy in respect of the remuneration of their senior managers. The HSE as part of the Service Agreement process for 2014 will require all funded agencies to disclose senior management remuneration and will have systems and processes in place to oversee compliance with this aspect of each funded agency&rsquo;s service agreement.</p><p>  The HSE is committed to the development of effective working relationships in line with the provisions of the Health Act 2004 and significant progress has been made in improving the governance and management framework between the HSE and voluntary service providers. A Register of Non-Statutory Agencies covering Service Arrangements and Grant Aid Agreements is in operation.  This provides information on Agencies and facilitates the maintenance of key information on funding arrangements including compliance with requirements under the HSE's formalised national governance framework to manage the funding provided to voluntary organisations.  This governance documentation was developed in 2009, with the agreement of all major service providers, and came into operation across all sectors in 2010. These Governance Documents ensure a national standard consistent application of good governance and is subject to regular review. </p><p>  In 2013 an additional information return was also added to all Service Arrangements, both Section 38 and 39, requiring agencies to separately report on all individual staff paid at Grade 8 level equivalent or above, detailing their salary including allowances and any other benefits paid. The HSE&rsquo;s internal audit service also provides audit reviews of Agencies either on an individual Agency basis, a sample basis, or across a range of agencies on a specific topic such as the recent Section 38 Agencies Remuneration Audit.  The results of these audits have influenced the documentation reviews and recommendations relating to the management structures, and corporate processes.</p></reply>

I designated the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) as the Competent Authority for those functions related to the protection of animals used in scientific procedures, including the application of the 3Rs (i.e. principles of replacement, reduction and refinement). The IMB has the relevant expertise in relation to both human and veterinary medicine to undertake this regulatory work. Given that many of the additional requirements under the above Directive are of a highly specialised nature, the IMB has put in place a small but expert cadre of officials well versed and experienced in this area.</p><p>  In transferring the functions involved to the IMB in 2013, my Department agreed to provide the IMB with the necessary funding for the setting up and provision of the service involved in 2012 &amp;amp; 2013; the provision of further exchequer funding for 2014, 2015 and 2016 being scaled back in a step wise fashion such that the IMB would be required to advance a sustainable funding stream for the regulation of the sector within this timeframe.  Accordingly, the IMB consulted with the sector on the application of an appropriate funding model during 2013; based on the feedback from the consultation the IMB proposed a fee regimen and my Department sanctioned certain fees for the provision of IMB services earlier this year. The fees are included in the Irish Medicines Board (Fees) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No 501 of 2013).</p><p>  The Department meets the  IMB on a regular basis to review implementation of the legislation in this area and consider matters arising. It is not the case that the IMB is in any way seeking to disadvantage the research industry in Ireland. In this regard, the IMB is obliged to verify compliance with the requirements of the Directive in as practical a manner as possible and by so doing assist the industry in its development. </p></reply>

The new Strategy sets a specific target for 2020 to reduce the number of road deaths to 124 a year (from 162 in 2012) and serious injuries to 330 per year (from 485 in 2012).  While the Road Safety Authority has overall responsibility for delivery of the Strategy, my Department is fully committed to delivering the specific targets assigned to it.</p><p>  The Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill 2013 which is now in the Seanad, contains a provision to allow for the introduction of roadside impairment testing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This testing consists of simple, physical, cognitive tests to assist the Garda&iacute; in determining the presence of intoxicants in drivers and whether a driver is capable of having proper control of a vehicle.</p><p>  In addition, my officials are currently drafting legislation to deal specifically with drug driving and the introduction of suitable equipment to detect a range of certain commonly used drugs at road side checkpoints.  This work is being carried out in collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety (MBRS) and the Road Safety Authority .  I understand that the MBRS intends to issue an invitation to tender shortly for the procurement of the roadside devices and it will then enter a period of testing of the devices.  It is my intention to introduce the enabling legislation this year as part of the next Road Traffic Bill.</p></reply>

For the Deputies' information,  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has incurred accumulated losses of &euro;130m in the past five years, a position which is unsustainable. </p><p>  My Department and the NTA are working with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to increase the efficiency and attractiveness of existing rail services.  The Government continues to provide substantial Exchequer investment in the rail network, in addition to subvention payments for Public Service Obligation (PSO) services.  There have been reductions in subvention in recent years due to pressure on the public finances but I will be proposing that there be no further cuts to the PSO subvention from 2015.</p><p>  Through the NTA, my Department is also funding the use of smart technology to make public transport easier to access and more reliable for the user.  Significant progress has been made with the Leap card, Real Time Passenger Information, and the National Journey Planner which maps all public transport services across the country.  It is important to point out that significant savings can be made by passengers who choose to avail of the integrated ticket, the Leap card.  In many cases, passengers will be paying fares that are below 2011 cash fares when using the Leap card.</p><p>  The use of Wi-Fi on trains and buses has also improved the transport experience.  The NTA will continue to progress these consumer-friendly initiatives which make using public transport more attractive.  The public transport experience has improved significantly and that is where we must target our efforts in future.  I hope that no further reductions in subvention, a stabilisation of passenger numbers as the economy improves and cost-saving measures in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will mean that future fare increases can be minimised.</p><p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated that it is in the process of implementing new energy saving fleet utilisation initiatives on its DART and Intercity services to generate fuel savings, which will reduce fuel and maintenance costs by &euro;3.2m per annum. Concerns about overcrowding have been raised with the Chief Executive of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I understand that the company has already responded and re-introduced larger carriages to accommodate passengers where this has been considered necessary.  The Chief Executive has agreed to continuous monitoring of carriage levels on both DART and Intercity services to ensure they match passenger demand.</p><p>  I am advised that carriages were only reduced at off-peak times.  Overcrowding on DART services which has occurred at peak times was caused by other issues including technical faults, industrial relations and leaf falls.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has stated that full loading (involving standing by passengers) is the norm internationally on urban rail systems similar to DART and Commuter services and can be safely accommodated.  The Railway Safety Commission (RSC) also met with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann regarding DART services and is satisfied that corrective measures have and are being taken with regard to crowding on DART.</p></reply>

An increasing number of vehicles have DRL fitted as standard, and it became mandatory on all new cars entering the national fleet from 2011 onwards in accordance with EC Directive 2008/89/EC.  New trucks and buses are required to have DRL since August 2012.  It is estimated that through the gradual renewal of the national fleet almost all vehicles will be equipped with DRL by 2024, with significant numbers being compliant in advance of that date.</p><p>  DRL is not mandatory in Ireland. In recent years the RSA undertook a review of the policy options available for the mandatory introduction of DRL and concluded that DRL should not be made obligatory at present.  Experience in other countries especially Sweden where DRL has been mandatory since 1977, shows that mandatory DRL works best where all vehicles are fitted with dedicated DRL and where there has been intensive promotion and awareness campaigns prior to DRL being made mandatory.  In Ireland most vehicles do not yet have dedicated DRL and the RSA analysis has shown that the costs of retrofitting DRL at the current time outweighs the benefits.  The RSA has recommended that the position be reviewed again in about 4 years.  In the meantime, the RSA will intensify the promotion of DRL with a view to significantly increasing the use of DRL on a voluntary basis, in particular during the period September to March and in wet or poor conditions.</p></reply>

Vehicles which are temporarily not in use can deteriorate during the period while they are off the road and I have no proposals to introduce an "off the road" derogation system similar to that recently introduced for motor taxation.  The new certificate of roadworthiness (CRW) issuing system is aligned to the long-standing obligation to have commercial vehicles tested annually.  The period of validity of a CRW is calculated by reference to the last test due date.  A delay in completing the test has the effect of reducing the validity period of the CRW. The longer the delay in completing the test, the shorter the validity period of a CRW.</p><p>  In cases where a vehicle is overdue its test by more than one year and is presented for testing, the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Testing Regulations 2013 provide that the period of validity for the CRW shall be either 6 months falling after the testing date or a period of validity determined by reference to the date of the anniversary of the test due date whichever is earlier.  This change was introduced so as to ensure that an operator who does not test the vehicle by the due date does not gain any economic advantage over an operator who tested their vehicle annually in accordance with the legal requirements and I have no proposals to amend the current testing requirements.</p></reply>

The foundation of exchange relationships on driving licences with other jurisdictions is mutual examination of the driver licensing regimes to make sure that they are compatible.  On the Irish side, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).  In Canada, driver licensing operates at provincial rather than national level.  This means that agreements have to be reached with the individual provinces.</p><p>  The RSA has been engaging for some time with a number of provinces in Canada, with the assistance of the Irish embassy in Ottawa, with a view to reaching agreements on mutual exchange.  Some provinces in Canada were identified as places where there was the best opportunity for progress, and Ontario was treated as a priority due to the large number of Irish people now living there.  The RSA has indicated to me that it is satisfied following discussions with Manitoba, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador that agreement can be reached with those provinces on the exchange of driver licences.  The RSA will be officially advising those provinces of this during the next number of days.  The next step will be to conclude a formal agreement with those provinces (a type of Memorandum of Understanding).  When this is done, I expect to sign the necessary regulations to give effect to the arrangements.</p></reply>

The World Tourism Organisation was established in 1975 to replace the International Union of Official Travel Organisations, whose membership comprised the national tourism organisations of more than 80 countries.  The WTO became a specialised agency of the UN in 2003.  Ireland has never been a member of the UNWTO.  I understand that USA and the UK are not current members either. Other EU countries which are not on the current list of members include Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden.  The question of Irish membership of the WTO has been considered on a number of occasions since 1975.  The consistent opinion has been that the potential benefits to Irish tourism were limited and would not justify the costs involved.</p><p>  For most tourism administrations, the most useful aspect of WTO activity has been its role in compiling international tourism statistics.  Both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have access to WTO reports and have indicated that Irish membership of the WTO would not result in any significant improvement in information access.  Neither do they view funding for membership of the WTO as a priority. It should also be noted that non-membership does not preclude attendance at various seminars/conferences organised by UNWTO.  Outside of the UNWTO, Ireland is involved in other tourism committees at international level.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-21a.1577.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012100085#WREE03700"><p>No grants were paid by my Department to Shannon airport in 2013 nor were there any debts owing by the airport to my Department. Credit arrangements or loan agreements between SAA and third parties, including agencies under the aegis of my Department, are a commercial matter for those bodies.  That said I understand from SAA that, other than normal trade creditors, the company had no debts in 2013.  The Deputy will of course be aware that in the previous year, Shannon airport secured its independence from DAA. On 31 December 2012, the assets and business of Shannon airport were transferred by DAA to the Shannon Airport Authority while DAA retained all then existing group debt following this restructuring.</p><p>  Under the proposed restructuring of SAA and Shannon Development, there will be no transfer of assets from the latter to the airport. It is proposed that a new commercial State company, Shannon Group plc, will be established and that both SAA and Shannon Development will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of that new company.  Both subsidiaries will maintain their separate legal identities, and their assets. While Shannon Development&rsquo;s annual accounts for last year are not yet available, I understand that the company&rsquo;s total income was approximately &euro;12m, of which approximately &euro;8.4m  was rental income. Total expenditure by Shannon Development last year was approximately &euro;12.5m.</p><p>  One of the priorities arising from the Shannon Task Force report of 2012 was the urgent need to stem the constant fall in passenger numbers at the airport over the previous five years.  As the Deputy will be aware from the results announced recently by the airport, the SAA achieved this crucial objective last year and the decline of the airport has been halted.  Passenger numbers last year were 1.4m, a marginal increase on 2012&rsquo;s figure of 1.39m.  This is a major achievement for Shannon in its first year as an independent airport and now that traffic has been stabilised, the airport authority is looking forward to renewed growth this year.</p><p>  The next major step in implementing the Task Force recommendations will be the publication of the Bill to provide for the establishment of Shannon Group on a statutory basis.  This Bill is currently being finalised by my Department in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I expect to publish it next month.  In tandem with the preparation of the Shannon Group Bill, work on developing the vision for an aviation services centre in Shannon has also been progressed and that work will continue.  I am confident that this work will result in the establishment of new business activities and the creation of new job opportunities in the medium term.</p></reply>
