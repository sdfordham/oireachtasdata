    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-08a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110800045#WRA00500"><p><font color="#002041">I would like to thank Deputy Martin for raising this issue.</font></p><p><font color="#002041">  Hospital-acquired patient infections continue to be an issue in hospitals worldwide.  Many of these infections are difficult to treat as they involve antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where the infectious agent is resistant to a treatment to which it was previously sensitive.   </font><font color="#002041">Current evidence shows that while antimicrobial resistance in MRSA has continued to decline. Over the last five years MRSA infection among people with the infected agent has declined from 40% to 23.5%. However, resistance in other organisms, such as E Coli, is rising. In relation to the incidence of infection, there has been a decrease in central IV line infection and a decrease in C. difficile infection.  There has been a minimal increase in peripheral line infection.</font></p><p><font color="#002041">A national clinical programme, under the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (RCPI) and the HSE, is in place to address this issue.  This will be run through a multidisciplinary clinical advisory group under RCPI governance, with joint working groups on prevention of surgical site infection and critical care and hospital-acquired infection.  An HSE implementation group will be chaired by the National Director for Patient Safety, Dr Philip Crowley, and the programme operated under the Regional Directors of Operations. The issue is also being addressed outside the acute system, through initiatives in primary and long term care.</font><font color="#002041">The programme aims to ensure that healthcare workers focus on three areas every time they care for patients.  These are:</font></p><p> -  <font color="#002041">Hand hygiene compliance </font></p><p>-  <font color="#002041">Appropriate use of antimicrobials </font></p><p>-  <font color="#002041">Prevention of medical infections associated with medical devices such as intravenous lines and urinary catheters.</font></p><p><font color="#002041">Because treatment of these infections is complicated by antibiotic resistance, emphasis is being placed on better antimicrobial use and on hygiene-related measures in hospitals, with compliance in this area audited on a regular basis. </font><font color="#424282"> </font>The most recent data shows that compliance with certain measures are at appropriate levels, and that increased effort is needed in other areas.  For instance,<font color="#002041">hand hygiene compliance has improved, with the most recent hand hygiene compliance audit (June/July 2012) indicating an increase to 81.6% (below the 2012 target of 85%). Nursing/midwives scored the highest (86%) with medical staff the lowest (69%).  I recognise that there is a need for further improvement in this area and in particular in relation to aseptic tasks, such as inserting an intravenous (IV) line, where compliance is at a sub-optimal rate of 80%.  </font></p><p><font color="#002041"> I am very much aware of this issue, and will continue, as will my department, to monitor measures being taken by the HSE and the compliance audits of these measures. While this issue requires ongoing clinical vigilance, I am satisfied that current measures are having a positive effect, as is evident from a decrease in incidence of infection and decline in AMR in relation to MRSA.</font></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-08a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110800045#WRA00700"><p>A review of the Rowan Ward HIV respite service found that when the Rowan Ward was set up in 1990 its purpose was to provide end stage palliative care to AIDS patients.  In more recent times, the ward had come to provide respite and stabilisation for a limited number of HIV patients who were also clients of the HSE addiction services.  Given these changes in the Rowan Ward service model the review outlined alternative care pathways for the Rowan Ward client base within the homeless/addiction sector.</p><p>  Following the review, the HSE proposed to close the Rowan Ward and to locate the service in an existing service in the homeless/addiction sector.  This was accomplished by the creation of eight dedicated beds for the Rowan Ward patient group within an addiction/homeless service currently provided by Dublin Simon in Ushers Island.  The transfer of Rowan Ward clients to the Ushers Island facility commenced on 1st September 2012, overseen by a steering group consisting of statutory and voluntary service providers.  The new service provides a more amenable care pathway for the Rowan Ward HIV patients and the staff in the Ushers Island complex will be better positioned to manage clients with addiction associated issues.  This approach will see Dublin Simon taking responsibility for the service, thereby delivering improved clinical governance as part of a Service Level Agreement.</p><p>  The Rowan Ward clients have been temporarily located within the existing Ushers Island campus.  However, a new unit is nearing completion in a separate building which is currently being refurbished, and this will serve as a permanent home for the Rowan Ward clients.  No planning application was required for this refurbishment work as it only involves internal structural development. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-08a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110800045#WRA00900"><p>The recent NESC report: 'Quality and Standards in Human Services in Ireland: Disability Services' was very timely in that it followed the recent publication of the Value for Money and Policy Review (VFMPR) of Disability Services by my Department and was in advance of the current consultation being carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority ( HIQA) on the revised draft standards, for residential services for both adults and children's disability services, which will allow for a robust registration and inspection system to be put in place by way of regulation by mid 2013.</p><p>  One of the main challenges facing the disability sector identified by the report is that there has been little formal regulation in the sector, with no inspections or compulsory standards.  As I have indicated previously, it is a priority for this Government  to put the draft  HIQA standards for the disability sector on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are registered and inspected by HIQA. These draft standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.    </p><p>  The draft standards document is currently the subject of a 5 week consultation process prior to being finalised and brought before the Board of HIQA. e final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with a likely publication date in January 2013. It is expected that the new regulatory system should be up and running by mid 2013.  Work is also ongoing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law. These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  </p><p>  In broader terms, the report echoes many of the findings of the VFMPR report and my Department in conjunction with the HSE, is currently developing an implementation framework for the recommendations in the VFMPR report which will be informed by the NESC report as appropriate. It is the intention that adherence to quality standards and a focus on personal outcomes, as underpinned by personal needs assessments, will be built into service provision as the recommendations in the review are implemented, so as to align disability service provision with Government policy, over time and within available resources.  </p></reply>

This will speed up access and egress from acute care (reducing ED times, length of stay, and delayed discharges). In 2012, this initiative will see 190 transitional care beds being put in place along with 150 rehabilitation beds, with the initial focus being on the Dublin North East and Dublin Mid-Leinster regions. There will also be investment in home supports and funding provided for rehabilitation packages (rehabilitation at home) and home adaptations. &euro;12m has been made available to year end.</p><p>  This initiative is about improving the patient experience and outcomes for our frail older people. The initiative will also underpin significant savings in bed days through moving from acute beds to transitional and rehabilitation beds and through reduction in the average length of stay for patients in acute beds.</p><p>  In relation to the specific information sought by the Deputy I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

I understand that approximately 35 women who suffered an unnecessary bilateral oophorectomy were excluded from the Redress Scheme on the basis of age alone. The Scheme of Redress approved by Government in 2007 was a non-statutory, <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme.  Awards were determined by an independent Redress Board in 2007 and 2008.  </p><p>My Department has been engaged in a review to identify the most appropriate mechanism to compensate these women. This review has included taking instructions and legal advice, including advice from the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to bringing proposals to Government for a decision.  This process is ongoing, and it is my intention that it will be brought to a satisfactory, legally sound conclusion as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work.</p><p>The work of the Special Delivery Unit, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals, allowing us to treat as many patients as possible within budget. I believe that pursuing efficiencies through these means will be a far more productive approach than debating the number of beds open or closed at any one time.</p><p>In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. The emphasis in 2012 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter lengths of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery. For example, the implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s Acute Medicine Clinical Care Programme has saved 121,000 bed days to date this year. In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it provides safe, effective and efficient care to the maximum number of patients.</p><p>Throughout 2012 hospitals will open and close beds on various wards in order to deliver the planned level of activity. These beds may be closed for a number of reasons, including cost containment, infection control and refurbishment. It is not possible at this time to determine what beds in which wards will be closed and what length of time they will be closed for. The decision to open and close beds is made at hospital management level and approved by the Regional Director of Operations.</p><p>Please find attached the latest data in relation to bed closures for the week ending 28th October 2012.  There are 759 inpatient beds closed and an additional 11 day case beds.

It is currently estimated that 3,600 people still reside in these settings.   The Report defined a congregated setting as a residential setting of ten or more people. The Report found that, not withstanding the commitment and initiative of dedicated staff and management, there were a significant number of people still experiencing institutional living conditions where they lacked basic privacy and dignity, living their lives apart from the community and families.</p><p>  The HSE has established a National Implementation Group on Congregated Settings under its National Consultative Forum on Disabilities comprised of representatives from the HSE, disability umbrella groups and service user representative organisations. The Group is currently developing the high level implementation plan to be rolled out at  regional and local level, in full consultation with the appropriate stakeholders. Implementation of the Report will pose significant challenges for many stakeholders, including clients, families, disability service providers, the HSE, various Government Departments and statutory bodies, and representative organisations.   In the context of the Joint Housing Strategy for People with Disabilities; launched in October 2011, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community &amp; Local Government have worked closely to identify sustainable funding resources to maintain progress on the transition programme. While the overall implementation of decongregation is expected to be cost neutral, and not withstanding the significant progress on funding overall, the Department of Health has agreed to transfer funding of &euro;1 million to the Department of the Environment, Community &amp; Local Government  in 2013, to support the commencement of the programme. This funding will be ring fenced to meet the social housing needs of people leaving institutions in 2013,  enabling housing authorities to provide up to 150 new homes in the community. These units will be additional to the overall social housing supports which are expected to be delivered through all supply mechanisms in 2013.</p><p>  It must also be acknowledged that the Report recognises a seven year time-frame for the implementation of its recommendations.  The HSE has advised that this time frame should be treated with caution as there are a number of complexities involved due to multi dimensional elements of implementation including, individual choice of accommodation, living arrangements and location, funding, and the future role of staff, training and skill mix.</p></reply>

In identifying the new site, the Government has carefully considered the report of the Dolphin Group along with detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise. The report was published on Tuesday on the website of my Department.</p><p>  This decision has been made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations being of paramount importance. It is essential that the new children&rsquo;s hospital can deliver best clinical outcomes for our children. Co-location with an adult hospital has been deemed essential by the Dolphin report, and by all previous reports on this issue, while tri-location with a maternity hospital is optimal.

Under UHI, every citizen will be insured and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premia for those who qualify for a subsidy.  I want to assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to the introduction of a universal health insurance model and is of the view that this model of healthcare will deliver the necessary reform of our healthcare system.  </p><p>  In designing the precise model of care on which universal health insurance will be based, I want to ensure that it meets the needs of the Irish system and achieves the best outcomes for patients.  This requires that we carefully plan and sequence the reform programme and that we give detailed consideration to the most appropriate structures for delivery of different services.  We also need to look at the relationships between services, and at best practice in healthcare reform.</p><p>  To help us in this work, I established an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance in February of this year.  The Group is tasked with assisting the Department of Health in developing detailed and costed implementation proposals for universal health insurance and in driving the implementation of various elements of the reform programme. The Group consists of a mix of those with executive responsibilities within the health service and external expertise, including international experts. </p><p>  The Implementation Group has already met on five occasions and has advised the Department in relation to its work on some of the core building blocks for UHI, including the introduction of a Money Follows the Patient funding system and the creation of Hospital Groups. </p><p>   The Group will also assist my Department in preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.  The White Paper will outline details of the UHI model in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance.  </p><p>  Preparation of a White Paper is a complex and technical process. It will require significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise.  Officials in my Department, in consultation with the Implementation Group on UHI, are putting in place a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into the Department&rsquo;s preparation of the White Paper.  This work is ongoing at present with a view to ensuring that the White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&rsquo;s term of office.  </p><p>  To complement the work of the Implementation Group on UHI, I also established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum in February of this year.  The Forum comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.  </p><p>  This Forum has been established with a view to generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. Its core focus is on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.</p><p>  Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  </p></reply>

These Safeguard Clauses cover exceptional circumstances in which Member States may, on scientifically justifiable grounds, provisionally authorise applications for derogations relating to a number of restrictions set out in the Directive  including authorisation of procedures involving severe pain, suffering or distress that is likely to be long lasting and cannot be ameliorated. </p><p>  Under Article 55(3), such exceptional provisional measures could, for example, be required to deal with an unexpected outbreak of a life threatening or debilitating clinical condition in humans or an outbreak of an highly infectious pathogenic disease. The Safeguard Clauses would also allow for emergency measures in the event of a natural disaster that resulted in, for example, the contamination of land and livestock.</p><p>  It will only be possible to introduce any such provisional measure by way of Ministerial Order after consultation with the Irish Medicines Board (the Competent Authority for the purposes of the Directive) and any such measure will be subject to EU Member State and Commission scrutiny and approval. The European Commission, assisted by an Advisory Committee (composed of Member State representatives and chaired by the Commission) must, subsequently, authorise or disallow any such provisional authorisation. </p><p>  It is clear from the Directive that the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing is at the core of this legislation and I strongly endorse this objective. Nevertheless, and even if difficult to foresee, it is my considered view that it is both reasonable and correct to make provision for exceptional emergency situations that might arise, if only to ensure that the necessary legislative tools are available to deal with such an eventuality. The Directive provides Member States with the legislative tools needed to respond in an effective way to such situations. Not to incorporate such tools in our transposition of the Directive might prove to be most regrettable if fate were to take a hand.</p></reply>

A special allocation of &euro;35 million was provided in Budget 2012 for mental health, in line with commitments in the Programme for Government.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children&rsquo;s mental health services by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.  Of the 414 posts approved to implement the &euro;35 million package, 150 will be allocated to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams. The National Recruitment Service of the HSE is currently working to recruit the necessary personnel and the posts are at various stages in the recruitment process.  It is hoped that the bulk of the appointments will be made by the end of the year.  </p><p>  It is envisaged that the completion of the multi-disciplinary profile of current teams will facilitate further progress on the reduction in the waiting lists for CAMHS services.  It is worth noting that despite an increase in demand for such services, the number of children waiting for an appointment reduced by 12% in the 12 month period to June 2012.</p><p>  In terms of in-patient facilities, psychiatric bed capacity for children and adolescents has increased from 12 beds in 2007 to 44 at present - 12 in Dublin, 12 in Cork and 20 in Galway.  Work on the second phase of the Child and Adolescent Unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview has recently been completed and this will increase capacity from 12 to 18 beds in Dublin by the end of 2012.  The increase in bed capacity in recent years is reflected in an almost 50% decrease in admissions of children to adult units since 2008.  </p><p>  The Linn Dara Child and Adolescent Mental Health Facility at Cherry Orchard, Dublin has recently opened and a number of Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams have moved in to the new premises.  It is expected that the Day Hospital will be in operation by the end of the year. Thj HSE is also seeking tenders from contractors as part of the process to develop a 22 bed Child and Adolescent in-patient facility on the Cherry Orchard site. The closing date for receipt of tenders is 22nd November.</p><p>  Finally, a 10 bed Child and Adolescent Forensic Mental Health Unit will be provided as part of the National Forensic Mental Health Project. The Unit will be based in Portrane, co-terminus with the new Central Mental Hospital which is expected to be operational by 2016.</p></reply>

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. Reform across the three domains of access, quality and resources is not achievable unless there is real clinical and managerial accountability at hospital level.</p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals. It is about the bringing together groups of hospitals to form single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery. With specific regard to the South East there remains full commitment to the retention of Waterford as one of the 8 existing national cancer services with all the associated services required in the hospital. The Trauma Centre at Waterford will also be retained. The provision of other services at any hospital site will, of course, primarily be determined by the appropriate clinical programme for that service, taking account of the population which the hospital serves and services provided by other hospitals which are within a reasonable commute.</p><p>  Last June I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. The Strategic Board has representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions. A Project Team was established to make recommendations to the Strategic Board on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions. </p><p>In order to form these recommendations, the project team has carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other health service agencies.  The consultation process included 2 days of meetings with the hospitals in the South East, on 9th July and again on 4th   October. Submissions, including a significant number of submissions from representatives of the South East hospitals and citizens from that Region have also been received by the group. </p><p>  Work is continuing on finalising a Draft Report on the recommendations outlined above for submission to the Strategic Board.  This report will be considered by the Board when they meet on 14th November. When the Board have signed off on this Report it will be submitted to me and I will then bring it to Cabinet. The composition of Hospital groups will be a Government decision, taking into account the recommendations of that Report.</p><p>  Hospital groups will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2014. Before those trusts are established the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. </p></reply>

Where this is not an option, for whatever reason, we support access to short-term or long-term residential care.</p><p>  In relation to the figure of approximately 600 acute hospital patients referred to in the Deputy's question, the majority of these patients are awaiting discharge to either nursing homes or other care options. Figures provided to the Department show that, of the figure quoted by the Deputy,  less than 10% over the period January-October 2012 have been delayed discharges due to awaiting provision of  HSE Home Support services. </p><p>  The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve its approach to all relevant aspects of its Home Supports services. These include various new guidelines for Home Care, and a new Procurement Framework for approved agencies providing services on its behalf. While on-going developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other relevant aspects of service for both providers and care recipients alike.   This has been a challenging year for the health services overall, including maintaining services in line with evolving resource pressures. The overall provision of home support services is therefore regularly reviewed at national and local levels, in the context of client need and resource availability.    </p><p>  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE Home Support provision for the remainder of 2012, investment in these services remains significant with provision in the region of &euro;320m expected for Home Help and Home Care Packages this year.  Decisions in relation to the provision of home help hours will continue to be based on a review of individual needs.</p></reply>

Information needs to be collected, analysed and intelligently interpreted in order to allow the health system and population it serves to monitor what it is doing, recognise where improvements are occurring and identify potential problems, so that actions can be taken to rectify them.  </p><p>It makes sense to use available data and information to support important issues such as patient safety and quality of the care.  The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry Scheme (HIPE) system is the largest system providing information on hospital care in this country.  </p><p>With this in mind, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department has been working on a report entitled <b><i>&#8216;Health Care Quality Indicators in the Irish Health System: Examining the Potential of Hospital Discharge Data&#8217;</i></b>.  This includes the measure of recorded 30 day in-hospital mortality rates following heart attack.  </p><p>The work to date demonstrates the value of using HIPE as a tool to derive knowledge and understanding of health care quality.  However, this work has also uncovered variation in the accuracy of data as reported through the HIPE system.  Some individual hospitals have looked into the origin of this variation and attributed it to inaccuracies in both the medical chart and the subsequent coding of information that is then inputted by individual hospitals in the HIPE system.  </p><p>I am concerned about this finding in relation to data quality given its potential patient safety implications. I believe that, arising from this, there is a duty on all hospitals to address measures that can ensure that the information which they record and report is accurate.  </p><p>Concerns have been raised by certain hospitals and clinicians that the report, which seeks only to examine quality of data, could be either inadvertently or deliberately misinterpreted as making inferences on quality of care. I understand this concern.  However, I do not accept that the solution is to disregard these data.  Where that source of information is found to be flawed the solution is to improve it.  These data have been collected by hospitals and the hospitals themselves must be accountable for the quality of them.  </p><p>Therefore, the CMO in conjunction with the HSE and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), wrote to every public hospital in the country in 2012 requesting that they ensure that the information they recorded and reported for 2011 and 2012 was accurate.  </p><p>It is expected that the report will be finalised and published in the near future.</p></reply>

The HSE National Service Plan 2012 provides for a 3.7% reduction in budgets but makes it clear that there is scope for achieving efficiencies of 2%, thereby limiting as much as possible the impact on front line services. Despite this reduction, which is similar to that applied across all care areas in the Health sector, the HSE has undertaken to maximise the provision of services within available resources by providing for the following in 2012:<blockquote>  - 9,100 people in residential places<br /><br />  - 18,600 day service places<br /><br />  - 6,300 people receiving respite residential support<br /><br />  - 1.64 million hours of Personal Assistant / Home Support Hours</blockquote>  As you know, I recently published the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services which identifies fundamental issues that need to be addressed in the way in which HSE-funded disability services are managed and operated, and lays the groundwork for the introduction of a significant restructuring of the Disability Services Programme through: </p><p>  (i) migration from an approach which is predominantly organised around group-based service delivery towards a model of person-centred, individually chose, supports; and </p><p>  (ii) implementation of a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use. </p><p>  I must also stress that the nature of the core underlying deficit within the HSE, taken together with the requirements nationally to bring our public spending deficit down by 2015, will make 2013 and 2014 extremely challenging for all sectors, not just Health. I will be doing all possible to ensure that as much protection as possible is afforded to the disability sector, and the Social Care area as a whole.</p></reply>

The main provisions of the new Agreement are as follows:</p><p>With effect from 1st November 2012, the ex factory price of all patent protected medicines reimbursed in Ireland prior to September 2006 will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and UK).</p><p>With effect from 1st November 2012, the ex factory price of all patent expired medicines which do <i>not</i>   have a generic equivalent on the Irish market will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries.</p><p>With effect from 1st November 2012, the ex factory price of all patent expired medicines which <i>have </i>a generic equivalent on the Irish market will be reduced to 60% of the original price.  With effect from 1st November 2013, the price will be reduced to 50% of the original price.</p><p>In the case of medicines which go off patent after 1<sup>st</sup> November 2012, the ex factory price will drop to 70% of the original price as soon as a generic equivalent comes on the Irish market. After 12 months, the price will be reduced to 50% of the original price. </p><p>  With effect from 1st January 2013, the ex factory price of medicines introduced to Ireland after<i></i>September 1<sup>st</sup> 2006, will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries.</p><p>  The deal will deliver a number of important benefits, including</p><p>significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,</p><p>a lowering of the drugs bill to the State,</p><p>timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions,</p><p>reducing the cost base of the health system into the future,</p><p>  This deal, combined with an interim agreement reached with IPHA in the Summer, means that &#8364;16 million in drug savings will be made this year. It is estimated that the deal will generate savings of up to &#8364;116m in 2013, &#8364;136m in 2014 and &#8364;150m on 2015.  A breakdown of savings by scheme is not currently available.  The cost of new drugs over the next three years is estimated to be &#8364;210 million.</p><p>  This landmark deal with IPHA comes as legislation aimed at reducing the cost of generic drugs makes its way through the Oireachtas. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution, is a priority for this Government.

It is essential that all hospitals provide care in the right way, at the right location, and in a manner that ensures a safe, high quality service for all.</p><p>  The Government is committed to securing and further developing the role of our smaller hospitals which will see them provide more, not fewer services.  The challenge is to make sure that they provide services, which can safely be delivered in these settings, in order to maximise the benefit to patients.  All hospitals, irrespective of size, as well as associated GP and community services, must work together in an integrated way. There have already been very significant developments recently in health care delivery, particularly in the context of shifts to day surgery and ambulatory care, and the centralisation of low volume high complexity care into larger centres. In this context, it is necessary that we redefine the role of the smaller hospitals so that they continue to play a central part of the Irish Health care system.</p><p>  The Framework for Smaller Hospitals defines the role of the smaller hospitals. It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together. The Framework outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within the smaller hospital.  It defines the need for the smaller hospital to be supported within a group of hospitals in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff and the safe management of patients who present with varying levels of complexity. It also sets out to address the categories of services that should transfer from the larger to the smaller hospitals and <i>vice versa</i> within a Hospital Group so that services are delivered in the most appropriate hospital.</p><p>  Work is in progress on developing a detailed plan for service enhancements in each of the nine smaller hospitals that are covered by the Smaller Hospitals Framework.  These plans are based on detailed local analysis of the services in place and what can be provided in the future.</p><p>  I am determined to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely and appropriately in smaller, local hospitals. On this basis, the organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the ongoing development of the HSE Clinical Programmes.  With this in mind the Framework will set out what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospitals in the interest of better outcomes for patients.</p><p>  The Smaller Hospitals Framework is currently being examined in the context of the overall reorganisation of the health services.   The HSE is in the final stages of a consultation process to help inform the details of the service changes.  This consultation process has sought feedback from all stakeholders, including local communities and health professionals in each hospital who deliver the service, and their feedback will be captured as input to the change process. Until this process has been fully completed I do not think that it is appropriate to comment on individual hospitals at this time.</p><p>  It is my intention to publish the Framework when this process has been completed. </p></reply>

On foot of this commitment the Government will introduce a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI).</p><p>  A key stepping stone to the new system will be to develop independent not-for-profit hospital trusts in which all hospitals will function as part of integrated groups.  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.</p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals. It is about the bringing together groups of hospitals to form single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery.</p><p>  The provision of services at any hospital site will primarily be determined by the appropriate clinical programme for that service, taking account of the population which the hospital serves and services provided by other hospitals which are within reasonable a reasonable commute.</p><p>  Each Hospital Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes.  It is intended that non-executive Boards, consisting of representative experts, will oversee each Hospital Group management team and will have responsibility for decisions in relation to services in all hospitals in the Group.</p><p>  Earlier this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. A Project Team was tasked with developing criteria which will assist my Department in the development of policy in relation to the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions. The Team carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other health service agencies as well as reviewing a significant number of written submissions. </p><p>  Work is continuing on finalising a Draft Report on the recommendations for submission to the Strategic Board for consideration when they meet on 14th November. The Report will be submitted to me when the Board have signed off on it and in turn, I will then bring it to Cabinet.</p><p>  The Government will then decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2014. Before those trusts are established the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.</p></reply>

Co-location of maternity hospitals with adult acute services is the optimal solution for the provision of hospital-based maternity services, as it can provide access to the full range of medical and surgical specialties and clinical support services in sufficient volume and complexity to provide added value.  This is particularly important for high-risk mothers and babies.  Therefore it is proposed that the maternity hospitals should be relocated alongside adult acute services.  In this context the National Maternity Hospital is to be relocated to St Vincent's.</p><p>  This project cannot be dealt with in isolation and must be considered in the context of the HSE multi-annual capital programme.  The HSE is required to prioritise capital infrastructure projects within its overall capital funding allocation taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.  Work on the draft Capital Plan for the next multi-annual period 2013-2017 will begin shortly and will be submitted to my Department in due course.  My Department will then review the proposals and follow up where further details may be required.  The draft Capital Plan 2013-2017 will require my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Lengthy delays can occur between the discharge of patients and the receipt of payment from the health insurance companies.  I have emphasised to the HSE the importance of addressing this problem, in conjunction with the insurers, so that the maximum resources possible are available to the health system.</p><p>  The HSE has introduced a number of initiatives to improve the claims collection process and facilitate faster submission of claims which will accelerate income collection within the public hospital system.  In particular:</p><p> -&middot;The HSE has tasked hospitals with bringing down the value of claims awaiting Consultant action and hospitals will also target the highest-value claims.</p><p>&middot;- The proposals agreed by health service employers and the two consultant representative bodies at the Labour Relations Commission included a commitment on the part of all consultants to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers.  Consultants will be required to fully complete and sign private insurance forms within 14 days of receipt of all the relevant documentation and to co-operate with the secondary Consultant scheme whereby a secondary Consultant involved in a case can sign the claim form if the primary consultant has not signed within a reasonable timeframe.  They will also be required to support the implementation of electronic claim preparation. Health service management is now proceeding with implementation of this and other measures, having regard to the relevant provisions in the Public Sector Agreement.</p><p> -&middot; The HSE has also awarded the contract for the roll-out of an electronic claims management system in eleven HSE sites.  The system is currently operational in 6 HSE sites and a further 3 sites are expected to be operational by mid-November.  This system will address the deficiencies of the current paper based process, will streamline the claims collection process and will also ensure that standardised work practices are implemented across hospitals.</p><p>  Furthermore, my Department has agreed, in principle, a system of improved cash-flow and accelerated payment with private health insurers. This will provide a once-off cash flow benefit in 2012 in the order of &euro;125m.  The accelerated payment arrangements are at an advanced stage with the detail of the legal agreements between the HSE and Insurers expected to be finalised very shortly.</p></reply>

The agreement encompasses a range of flexibilities centred on enhancing productivity and efficiency on an ongoing basis and on maximising the availability of consultants, as key clinical decision-makers.  Health service managers are proceeding with implementation of these measures as appropriate to each site and service, with effect from 5 November, in line with the procedures provided for in the Public Service Agreement.</p><p>  On 6 November, the Labour Court issued its recommendations in relation to three matters which had been referred to it.  These concern consultants' current &quot;rest day&quot; arrangements, the fee to consultant psychiatrists for giving a second opinion under the Mental Health Act 2001 and the issue of &quot;historic rest days&quot;.  Health service management will be taking the necessary steps over the coming weeks to give effect to the Court's recommendations.</p><p>  I look forward to all consultants embracing the changes agreed at the LRC and complying with the terms of the Labour Court recommendations, in the interests of providing the most appropriate and cost-effective services to patients.</p></reply>

As detailed in the HSE National Service Plan 2012, due to regional variations in service developments and budget allocations, data collected under the performance indicators process has become increasingly unreliable. The National Disability Governance Group is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the performance indicator process.  As a result, reliable data for 2008-2010 cannot be provided.</p><p>  In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant/home support hours were provided to persons with physical and/or sensory disability.  In 2012 the target for PA hours is 1.64 million hours.  It is anticipated that the outturn of 1.68 million in 2011 and the 2012 target will both be exceeded.  In 2011, an additional 16,000 hours PA/Home Support hours were provided as a result of &euro;10 million demographic funding allocated to Disability Services.  It was not possible to provide additional funding in 2012 for this purpose.</p><p>  Although the funding allocated to disability services in 2012 was reduced by 3.7%, the HSE's main aim was to minimize the impact this would have on service users and their families as much as possible.  Service efficiencies around the provision of Personal Assistant services are currently being achieved through a process of negotiation with service providers around the unit cost of providing the service, rather than reducing the number of PA hours.  In this context, the National Disability Unit is engaging with each HSE region to identify models and approaches in place pertaining to Personal Assistant and Home Support Services as well as cost, such as hourly and daily rates, involved in providing services.  This process will identify the precise nature of the services available with the intent of identifying agreed models of service delivery.</p><p>  Pending completion of the national estimates, budgetary and service planning process of 2013, it is not possible to predict the service levels to be provided next year.</p></reply>

The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways: -Health-funded rehabilitative (life skills) training (RT);</p><p>  -Health-funded day services;</p><p>  -F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training;</p><p>  -Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.</p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. In 2012, almost 700 school-leavers required RT places or day services and the position in 2013 is expected to be similar. Budgetary constraints and the moratorium on staff recruitment give rise to challenges in service provision. In addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. However both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner so as to be as responsive as possible to the needs of this cohort. While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services or RT places to school-leavers with special needs, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver. The HSE is currently reviewing the outcomes for 2012 school-leavers in terms of placements achieved and scoping out the likely requirements for  2013.</p><p>  There is evidence that an accelerated move towards a new model of individualised, person-centred service provision in the community can help to achieve efficiencies, particularly in relation to services for those with mild or moderate intellectual disability. The HSE has established an implementation project team to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult y Services. The report, published in February 2012,  titled 'New Directions', proposes that day services in the future take the form of a menu of 12 individualised, outcome-focussed  supports which will provide adults with disabilities with the support necessary to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes, aspirations and needs. The guiding principle for the future is that supports will be tailored to individual need and will be flexible, responsive and person-centred.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place.  This is a key requirement for the existing Private Health Insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  The Government published the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012 to give effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme to be applied from 1 January 2013 which I will shortly bring before the Oireachtas.  </p></reply>

I fully acknowledge the need for and support the provision of dedicated accommodation in an environment which allows appropriate isolation for improved infection control.</p><p>  Beaumont Hospital is one of the largest adult centres in Ireland, providing specialist treatment and services to adults with CF. A new outpatient cystic fibrosis unit was opened in Beaumont Hospital in November 2010. This CF dedicated centre facilitates the delivery of a comprehensive range of services by multidisciplinary teams.  These services include consultations with doctors and nurses and the provision of treatments, which might otherwise have required hospitalisation, assessment of pulmonary function, physiotherapy, dietetics and psychology. This unit has a significant benefit for patients by having all services provided in a purpose-built facility.</p><p>  The building includes consultation and therapy rooms with air filtration units, which allow for twelve air changes per hour, approximately three times the average rate in a normal room.  This has significant benefit in reducing the time needed between patients for infection control purposes, which is particularly important for people with CF.</p><p>  While all appointments have to be scheduled, the new ambulatory day case unit facilitates patient access to essential services.  Along with priority access to four en-suite in-patient rooms on St. Paul&rsquo;s Ward, it means that for Beaumont&rsquo;s CF patients, admission as an in-patient via the Emergency Department should now be a rare occurrence.  This CF unit in Beaumont also contributes to the extensive research activities into CF already well established in Beaumont, principally in collaboration with the RCSI.</p><p>  A new dedicated Respiratory and CF unit was opened in Temple Street  in June 2010 providing state of the art facilities for children with respiratory disorders, their families and staff.  It includes a lung function laboratory with the most up to date equipment, spacious patient treatment rooms and outpatient clinic rooms.   The entire unit is fitted with a sophisticated air filtration system.  This unit serves as a focus for patient care including scheduled outpatient clinics, daily walk in CF clinics, initiation of intravenous antibiotics, upsizing of gastrostomy tubes, family education and support sessions and multi disciplinary  team meetings.</p><p>  The National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Laboratory is also located in Temple Street. The new unit facilitates care of the children diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis under the newborn CF screening programme.  I am fully aware of the challenges facing CF patients and of the need to support these patients and their families. I am committed to providing the best possible health service and will continue to work with the HSE to ensure the best possible outcomes for these patients.</p></reply>

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.

The Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible and is also strongly committed to protecting community rating, whereby older and less healthy customers should pay the same amount for the same cover as younger and healthier people.</p><p>  To support the principle of community rating, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market. I was pleased, therefore, to recently publish the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 on 18 October, to give effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) to be applied from 1 January 2013. An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  </p><p>  There can be little doubt that price increases will make it more difficult for persons who hold private health insurance to renew their policies. I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers. I will continue to focus strongly on this issue. </p><p>  I am keen to explore all available measures to limit the costs related to health insurance.  In February of this year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum has been established with a view to generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. Its core focus is on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.  </p><p>  In this regard, VHI has commissioned consultants to carry out an external review of their claims.  The review is nearing completion and will look at the opportunities and costs involved in possible reductions in utilisation that can be achieved by implementing appropriate utilisation management approaches. </p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.

This was completed earlier this year and the report of the findings <i>Creating Excellence in Dementia Care: a Research Review for Ireland&#8217;s National Dementia Strategy</i> has been published. A guide for the general public, <i>Future Dementia Care in Ireland: Sharing the Evidence to Mobilise Action</i> was compiled to disseminate the report&#8217;s findings and to give a better understanding of dementia. Both the report and the guide are available at<i></i><i> .</i></p><p>  A public consultation process which sought the views of interested parties, to help inform the development of the strategy concluded at the end of August and officials are currently examining the responses.  Following on from this process a working group will be established to develop the strategy in 2013.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of reimbursable items.  These include glucosamine, omega-3 triglyceride products, orlistat, and gluten-free products.</p><p>  Glucosamine is indicated for the management of symptoms of osteoarthritis.  The National Centre for Pharmoeconomics (NCPE) have assessed the cost-effectiveness of glucosamine on two occasions and concluded that it did not offer value for money to the HSE.  However, glucosamine products are available over the counter without prescriptions.</p><p>  Omega-3 triglyceride products (e.g. Omacor) have been identified both nationally and internationally as not being cost effective or being of lesser benefit to patients. However, these products are also available over the counter without prescriptions, as is Orlistat.</p><p>Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link:<i></i><i>  . </i> Separate application forms are available for children. For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes.</p><p>A full list of items available under the community drug schemes is available on the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service website, www.pcrs.ie (choose 'List of Reimbursable Items').  addition, the monthly updates (additions and deletions) to the product list are provided at the same location under ''  .</p></reply>

In this respect, a special allocation of &#8364;35m was announced in Budget 2012 for mental health which will be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children&#8217;s mental health services, advance implementation of <i>Reach Out,</i>  our national strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.  All of these measures will assist in the Government's drive to deal with mental health and suicide.</p><p><i>  Reach Out </i> is a comprehensive and integrated approach to reducing the loss and suffering from suicide and suicidal behaviours.  It encompasses the promotion, coordination, and support of activities to be implemented at national, regional and community levels.  The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of <i>Reach Out.</i>    NOSP has implemented a significant number of the recommendations in a four way strategy - delivering a general population approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention; using targeted programmes for people at high risk of suicide; delivering services to individuals who have engaged in deliberate self harm and providing support to families and communities bereaved by suicide.  </p><p>  It is widely accepted that suicide is a complex issue and that there are no easy or single interventions that will bring a guarantee of success.  International evidence shows that reducing the suicide rate and preventing suicides requires a collective, concerted effort from all groups in society.  Solutions, therefore, involve the whole community, a large array of voluntary organisations, specialist mental health professionals and mental healthcare provided by general practitioners and others in primary care.  The overall expenditure in time and resources in this area is significant and is always under constant review.  I cannot accept that all of these efforts represent failure on the part of any of those involved.</p></reply>

In the short term, to address the 2012 position, a range of measures are being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget. These include the use of capital to fund revenue on a once-off basis and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis. The HSE has been required to review all pay and non-pay savings targets with a view to further targeting all areas which do not compromise patient safety.</p><p>The HSE has indicated that it will achieve &#8364;130m in savings to address the deficit. Nearly 50%<b></b>will come from more focused cash and stock management initiatives, savings in medical equipment (non-capital), furniture, education, training, office expenses, travel and subsistence and advertising. &#8364;6m of savings will come from the non-reimbursement of certain non-essential products. Some &#8364;60.5m of savings will come from specific service-related measures.  These measures are now the subject of intensive discussions with the HSE and local stakeholders.  I have instructed the Executive that efficiencies must be achieved in the first instance before patient services are affected and in this regard, patient safety must be paramount.  </p></reply>

This comprehensive body of legislation recognised the new status of civil partnerships for tax purposes and set out the various rights, entitlements and obligations that apply to civil partners with regard to taxation.  For example, it allowed civil partners to avail of the tax bands and tax credits, which are available to married couples. It also provided for similar capital taxes and stamp duty reliefs on the transfer of property by gift or inheritance. As a result, transfers of property between civil partners now qualify for the same exemption from stamp duty as is given to married couples.</p><p>  This legislation provides for equitable tax treatment for same-sex couples in a registered civil partnership. Where individuals choose to cohabit rather than enter a civil partnership then they continue to be treated for tax purposes as single persons, such tax treatment being consistent with the treatment of opposite-sex cohabitants.

The Revenue Commissioners are in on-going discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on their immediate and medium term resource requirements.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the need to reduce public service numbers generally, an effective tax collection system is an essential element of our fiscal consolidation requirements. In that context, it is important that the Revenue Commissioners have the capacity to recruit staff with key skills and expertise not available within the existing public service.  To address skills gaps and deficits that are emerging, and the limited availability of staff from elsewhere within the public service with audit and compliance skills and experience, Revenue was recently granted sanction to undertake an open recruitment competition for Administrative Officer (Audit &amp; Investigation).</p><p>  In line with the Government policy on public service numbers, and the moratorium on recruitment, the specific sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is required to fill posts in the public service.  Public Service bodies are required to refer to the public service resource panel in the filling of any such posts in the first instance.  Where critical posts cannot be filled from within existing resources, or through redeployment from within the public sector, a public service body may, subject to sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, fill posts by open recruitment.  As the Revenue Commissioners are obliged to refer to the public service resource panel to fill posts in the first instance, and the resource panel is an evolving source, it is not possible to confirm how many new staff Revenue will be in a position to recruit from the current open Administrative Officer (Audit &amp; Investigation) panel or where those posts may be located.</p></reply>

The issue of the introduction of a rebate scheme for users of marked gas oil has been addressed in previous parliamentary debates.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a change to a system of this nature would involve the establishment of an expensive repayments system and would give rise to significant costs and place an administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners.  It would also pose significant cash-flow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.  Marked gas oil has a wide range of uses such as the propulsion of trains, the operation of agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and for commercial and home heating purposes.  Any change in the existing system would therefore impact across a wide range of users.</p><p>  Fuel laundering is a priority for the Revenue Commissioners who are tackling the problem on a number of fronts. For example, new and enhanced licensing provisions have been introduced for the sale of marked gas oil and auto-fuel. In addition, from January 2013, all fuel traders will make monthly returns to Revenue on their fuel stocks and transactions, enabling Revenue to identify unusual or suspicious patterns of activity.  Revenue is also collaborating with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs in the UK to ensure we tackle the problem in a consistent and complementary way and the two administrations are working together to seek a better marker.  Revenue continues to enforce the regulations actively at all stages of the fuel supply chain, targeting those involved in producing and selling laundered fuel. Since 2010, these interventions have resulted in the closure of 24 fuel laundering plants, the closure of over 70 fuel retail outlets and the seizure of over 2 million litres of fuel, together with associated equipment and transport.</p></reply>

The total cost of mortgage interest relief in 2011 is estimated at &#8364;357 million.  Given the current structure of mortgage interest relief, in that relief is available at varying rates and subject to certain ceilings, in respect of interest paid by first-time buyers and non-first-time buyers, on a loan used by that individual for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of his/her sole or main residence, it is not possible to calculate the cost of tax forgone of increasing mortgage interest relief for all loans taken out in or after 2004 by 1 percentage point in the time allowed.</p><p>  However, the tax forgone cost of increasing mortgage interest relief by 1 percentage point has been calculated in relation to first-time buyers who took out qualifying loans in the period 2004 to 2008 for whom the rate of tax relief was increased in Budget 2012.  The Revenue Commissioners tentatively estimate that the number of first-time buyers who qualified for this relief to be in the order of 214,000. The cost to the exchequer of that measure is estimated at &#8364;52 million in a full year.  The estimated cost to the exchequer of increasing the rate of mortgage interest relief by 1 percentage point for those first-time buyers is of the order of &#8364;11 million in a full year.

We continue to review all cost categories with a view to achieving savings where possible.   The Department of Finance has always been a strong adherent to the need for efficiency and has a track record of implementing change and reducing headcount. Some of the initiatives undertaken in this regard are highlighted below:</p><p> - The Department acts as a sizeable shared service centre for the Civil Service as outlined in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure of 2011.  The work of the Department in this area will already have allowed considerable cost and headcount efficiencies in client Departments or bodies.  The Department remains supportive of further developments in this area and would expect further efficiencies in client locations as the shared service concept is implemented more widely.</p><p> - Headcount in the Paymaster General Banking section has fallen from 18 in 2004 to 4 today, arising from automation and payable order reduction.</p><p> - The headcount in the combined pensions and salaries sections of 38 today compared to 34 in 2004 represents only a 12% increase, whereas 	the number of salaries and pensions being paid has risen by almost 85% from 16,400 in 2004 to 30,200 today.  Over 50% of this growth is due to the Department, payroll, as well as payment of pensions to VEC retirees, allowing headcount reductions in these client entities.</p><p> - The Department has also actively sought to augment its resources on a pro-bono basis through secondments from the private and public sectors.  Currently, the Department benefits from the services of eight individuals in this way without cost to the Exchequer.</p><p> - The Department is phasing out the issuance of paper payslips to pensioners.  This is expected to yield savings in the order of &euro;200k p.a.  The Department is also phasing out the use of payable orders which is expected to yield savings.</p><p> - The Department is targeting savings on the overtime bill in comparison with 2012 of some &euro;100k p.a.</p><p> - The Department has reorganised accommodation requirements, resulting in the termination of one lease which will generate savings of the order of &euro;0.45m per annum for the Exchequer.  We are also reviewing procurement arrangements with a view to introducing efficiencies and securing reduced rates 	from suppliers on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  However, we must also ensure that the Department of Finance is adequately resourced to address issues as they arise in the banking sector and to deliver on the considerable goals set out in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2011-2014. In particular, bank and debt restructuring work is driven by developments in Europe and the primary objective of that work is to ensure that the State optimises its position. We are entering a critical phase of potential restructuring based on the European political commitments expressed during the summer, with potentially very significant benefits to the national finances and therefore the related costs need to be considered. Furthermore, the economic planning initiatives of my Department, the fundamental objective of which is to improve the growth potential of the economy so as to reduce the level of unemployment, also carry an element of additional cost.  All of the above are currently under active consideration in the context of the appropriate allocation of the scarce resources of the State in the forthcoming budget.</p></reply>

The level of rent qualifying for rent relief depends on an individual&rsquo;s marital status and age.   In Budget 2011, it was announced that rent relief was being withdrawn on a phased basis. No new claimants were allowed from 7 December 2010 but existing claimants will continue to receive the relief, on a reducing basis, with a complete cessation of the relief from 2018. This is in line with the schedule proposed for the withdrawal of mortgage interest relief.

The full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to the tax year 2010, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available, is approximately &euro;1.3 million. However, this figure does not take account of the application of the high income individuals&rsquo; restriction to specified reliefs, including the artists' exemption and thus the actual yield could be lower. The restriction was originally provided for in Finance Act 2006 and was significantly tightened in Finance Act 2010. Individuals are now subject to the restriction where they have adjusted income of    &euro;125,000 and claim specified tax reliefs of &euro;80,000 or more.

The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions. A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &mdash; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &mdash; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.</p><p>However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 to the thresholds outlined in the question, and at the various specified marginal tax rates, in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be as shown in the following table.</p><p><pfli1>          <bu>Exchequer Yield</bu></pfli1></p><p><bu>Reduced Earnings Cap</bu><b>                </b>  <bu>Reduction in Relief  Allowable at specified   </bu></p><p>(below &euro;115,000)                                                            <bu>Marginal Tax Rates </bu></p><p><b></b></p><p><table><tr><th>&#8364;</th><th><div>Current Rate</div></th><th><div>34%</div></th><th><div>30%</div></th><th><div>20%</div></th></tr><tr><td>&#8364;100,000</td><td><div>&#8364;35m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;155m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;244m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;490m</div></td></tr><tr><td>&#8364;90,000</td><td><div>&#8364;65m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;165m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;274m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;510m</div></td></tr><tr><td>&#8364;80,000</td><td><div>&#8364;95m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;210m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;300m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;535m</div></td></tr><tr><td>&#8364;70,000</td><td><div>&#8364;130m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;240m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;329m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;555m</div></td></tr><tr><td>&#8364;60,000</td><td><div>&#8364;175m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;265m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;354m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;580m</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It may, broadly, be interpreted as meaning residence in a particular country with the intention of residing permanently in that country.  An individual acquires a domicile of origin on his/her birth.  Whilst each individual has a domicile, that domicile may or may not be the country in which he or she is tax resident.    An individual is not entitled to claim exemption from Irish tax solely by reason of being non-Irish domiciled.  An individual&rsquo;s liability to Irish tax is affected by an individual&rsquo;s residence, ordinary residence and domicile.  It is not possible to determine how much tax is foregone by reason of an individual claiming to be non-Irish domiciled. </p><p>  I am assuming that the reference to changes in Budget 2012 refers to the amendment to the Domicile Levy legislation announced in Budget 2012 and implemented in section 136 Finance Act 2012.  The Domicile Levy was introduced in the Finance Act 2010 and was charged on an individual: who in any year was Irish domiciled and an Irish citizen; whose worldwide income for the year exceeds &euro;1m; whose Irish located property in the year is greater than &euro;5m, and whose liability to Irish income tax for the year is less than &euro;200,000.</p><p>  Where a relevant person has paid Irish income tax for a year that person is entitled to a credit for the income tax paid in calculating the amount of the domicile levy for that year.</p><p>  The amendment introduced in section 136 Finance Act 2012 removed the requirement to be an Irish citizen. The affect of this amendment is that persons who meet the other criteria will be liable to the levy whether or not they are Irish citizens. The returns for the tax year 2012 will be the first returns affected by the amendment.  These returns are due to be filed on or before 31 October 2013 or in the case of persons filing their income tax returns using the Revenue Online System (ROS) on or before 15 November 2013. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as the filing deadline has not expired it is not possible at this point to determine how many persons this measure will affect for the tax year 2012.</p></reply>

In that year, an estimated 2,350 claimants availed of the artists&rsquo; exemption scheme at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of &euro;9.6 million. It should be noted that this figure takes account of the high income individuals' restriction which took effect for the first time in 2007. The impact of the measure in the income tax year 2010 was to reduce the value of the income tax relief under the artists' exemption by &euro;8.3 million.   The high income individuals' restriction was originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006 and was significantly tightened in Section 23 of Finance Act 2010. Individuals are now subject to the restriction where they have adjusted income of &euro;125,000 and claim specified tax reliefs of &euro;80,000 or more. Those subject to the full restriction now pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and Universal Social Charge.</p></reply>

The SEIS provides a higher rate of relief for qualifying investments in early stage enterprises, than is available under EIS and was introduced with effect from the 6th of April this year.   We have a similar incentive to the EIS called the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII), which commenced on 25 November 2011, following the receipt of State Aid approval from the European Commission. The EII provides tax relief of 30% on investments made in small and certain medium-sized enterprises, including early stage enterprises, with the possibility of a further 11% in tax relief at the end of a three year holding period. The incentive was previously known as the Business Expansion Scheme and was significantly amended to target limited Exchequer resources towards job creation. As part of these changes, access to the incentive was made available to the majority of small and medium-sized companies (SMEs).</p><p>  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that the level of funding raised by SMEs under the Business Expansion Scheme has been declining since 2008. This could be related to the economic downturn or to a lower appetite for risk among investors. It is too early to say whether the changes brought about by the introduction of EII will have the desired affect and halt such decline. However, the peak period for raising investments under EII is November/December and a better picture of the impact of the changes should be available next year.</p><p>  The introduction of any scheme that would provide higher tax relief for investments in certain companies could have the capacity to skew investments towards such companies. This could work to the detriment of other equally deserving companies that need to raise risk capital investments. Ultimately, the priority of the Government is to incentivise investments where they are most likely to create jobs. Therefore, I am inclined to be cautious as regards implementing further changes to the tax incentives available for such investments at the current time.</p></reply>

Once an SNA allocation has been made to a school, the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management of a school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated, and in accordance with the terms of the scheme as set out in my Departments Circular.  In circumstances where a parent may have a concern about the manner in which an SNA is being deployed in a school, they should raise this matter with the school Principal/Board of Management of the school in the first instance. </p></reply>

The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.  The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.</p><p>  Every school therefore must have in place a policy, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p><p>  In terms of other training I am very aware of the importance of appropriate teacher training and support in this and other aspects of teachers' day to day work with children.  In this regard, initial teacher education plays a huge role in training our teachers and ensuring that they are aware of the developmental and emotional needs of their students.  As part of their lifelong journey, teachers engage in ongoing professional development (CPD) and this will become a statutory requirement in the near future. CPD helps to ensure that teachers are aware of current research and best practice in working with young people.  In the area of anti-bullying, the Deputy will be aware that my Department currently funds the Social Personal &amp; Health Education (SPHE) Support Service which provides support for post primary schools including training courses on positive strategies for managing bullying issues.  Schools are also supported in the review of their anti-bullying policies and practices.</p><p>  At primary level, my Department's support services provide ongoing training and support to teachers and principals in the implementation of SPHE and the Stay Safe Programme, which includes a specific module on bullying.</p><p>  In addition to these support services, individual schools have autonomy to determine whether they wish to supplement or support the school's work in the area of anti-bullying with other external resources/materials as appropriate.</p><p>  As the Deputy knows, I am very aware of the need to tackle bullying and it was for that reason that an Anti-Bullying Forum was held in May this year.</p><p>  As a follow on to that Forum, I invited the stakeholders and any other interested parties to submit their views on this important topic to my Department by 29th June 2012.  I understand that the Anti-Bullying Campaign has made a submission as have many other interested parties.  </p><p>  I have also established a working group to address the issue of tackling bullying in schools, including cyber-bullying.  During the course of its work, the working group will be considering the outcomes from the Anti-Bullying Forum together with the submissions received.  Over the last few months, the working group has been consulting with a range of stakeholders and with counterparts  in Scotland and the UK.  The Group is working on an action plan recommending further measures that can be taken to effectively tackle bullying in schools.  The Group expects to complete its work by the end of the year.</p></reply>

This body will be funded from the contributions of the religious congregations offered in response to the request for additional contributions, following the publication of the Ryan Report.

It is a matter for individual schools to select the resources and textbooks available that best support their implementation of the syllabuses, including CSPE,  prescribed by my Department.  This flexibility gives schools the opportunity to select the resources that are most appropriate to the needs of their students.  However, it is expected that schools will enable their students to think critically about the content of the materials that are used during the teaching and learning process.  This is particularly true of subjects such as Civic, Social and Political Education, History and English where students are provided with the opportunity to analyse and interpret input, and to discuss the difference between fact and opinion and between bias and objectivity in texts and other materials. </p></reply>

The electrical services were upgraded and the heating system was replaced.  The historic rooms of the house were redisplayed and reinterpreted, new areas of the building were made accessible to the public and a space for temporary exhibitions was provided.  The caf&eacute; in the courtyard of St. Enda's Park was renovated in 2010 at a cost of &euro;340,447, including VAT.  The caf&eacute; is now open all year round for visitors to the Pearse Museum and St. Enda's Park.  A project is under way to repair one of the bridges in St. Enda's Park and replace a second one at a total cost of &euro;50,000.  It is hoped that an exhibition on the life of P.H.

The pay range profile has been updated since my reply to reflect the significant reductions in the numbers of public servants in the 1st quarter of 2012 and the current pay data profile (based on 292,000 whole time equivalent public servants) is referenced in detail in my replies to Question Nos. 39603, 39605 and 39606/12 of 19 September 2012 and 41225/12 of 27 September 2012. </p><p>  Based on the current numbers and pay range profile available to my Department, the estimated full year gross saving in the Exchequer and Local Government pay bill arising from a cap of &euro;100,000 is &euro;290m. The estimate takes account of the reductions in pay arising from the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, 2009, but does not take account of any offsetting reductions in taxes and levies. As the combined effect of the estimated marginal tax rate and the pension related reduction at a pay level for a public servant of &euro;100,000 p.a. or higher is at least 62.5%, the estimated net savings would be reduced to less than &euro;110m</p><p>  Estimates are based on basic salary range (excluding premium pay and allowances) but include employer&rsquo;s pay related social insurance. The Exchequer pay bill estimates include public servants serving in the Health Service Executive, Vocational Educational Committees and non commercial State agencies/bodies.  They do not include staff of commercial State -sponsored bodies or bodies funded by the State outside the public service since the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform  is not responsible for setting the rate of pay for employees (other than the Chief Executives of the commercial semi-State bodies) outside the public service. </p><p>  As the estimates are based on aggregated data across both the Exchequer funded and Local Authority funded pay bills, detailed data in the format sought by the Deputy (broken down by sector, State body, Department or unit) is a matter for the respective Minister responsible for the Department/Bodies concerned.</p></reply>

The average public service pension is estimated at around &euro;25,000 and many of these pensioners do not have any entitlement to the social welfare pension.  I would add that there would be legal issues arising from a proposal to introduce a 100% reduction for pensions above a certain level.  The changes in rates and bands proposed by the Deputy would save approximately &euro;10 million in a full year.  This figure would be reduced by the application of taxation.</p></reply>

At present, the position is that the 2010 legislation provides, with effect from 1 January 2011, for an average reduction of about 4% of pension, calculated in line with the following rates and bands:</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px"><table><tr><th>Annual Public Service Pension (&#8364;)</th><th>Reduction Rate</th></tr><tr><td>First 12,000</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Between 12,000 and 24,000</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Between 24,000 and 60,000</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Between 60,000 and 100,000</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>Balance above 100,000</td><td>20%</td></tr></table></div></p><p>I legislated last year to add the 20% rate for the over &euro;100,000 band with effect from 1 January 2012.</p><p>The measure secures annual savings estimated at &euro;100 million and applies to over 130,000 pensioners.  The PSPR applies to former civil and public servants and to the survivors pensions of spouses and children of former public servants.  The measure is tapered to mitigate the effect on the lowest level of pension income and is consequently progressive in nature.  Former public servants in receipt of high rates of superannuation benefit, including former members of the Government and the Oireachtas and other office holders, including the Judiciary, have and will bear the highest reduction.</p><p>The preamble to the 2010 legislation clearly establishes the PSPR as an emergency measure taken in the context of the financial and budgetary situation pertaining.  There are also significant safeguards built into the Statute, including an annual review and report which must be laid before the Oireachtas in June each year, as well as provision for me as Minister to examine cases for full or partial exemption and to remove doubts, where appropriate.</p></reply>

Manufacturers are required to ensure that weighing equipment is verified upon first use, and thereafter, traders should ensure re-verification is carried out following repair or adjustment of parts requiring official seals to be broken.</p><p>Compliance requires measuring instruments to be of an approved design and each individual piece of equipment must measure correctly within legal tolerances and be appropriately secured with tamper-evident devices to prevent unauthorised access to its calibration settings.

I fully expect that my Department will achieve the 2012 control targets.</p><p>Control savings represent an estimate of the value of prevented expenditure from control activity over a future period.  Control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department but are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these activities taking place.  These activities also have a deterrent or knock-on effect, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.</p><p>The following table gives a breakdown of the control savings and reviews recorded up to end Sept 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th>Achieve to end of September 2012 (YTD)</th><th>Annual Savings Target   &#8364;M</th><th><div> Amt. of savings YTD  &#8364;M  </div></th><th>Annual Reviews  <br />Target</th><th>No of Reviews YTD</th></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker Allowance &amp; Benefit</td><td><div>&#8364;102.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;64.00</div></td><td><div>194,000</div></td><td><div>174,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit &amp; Medical Review Assessment</td><td><div>80.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;44.00</div></td><td><div>154,000</div></td><td><div>100,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance/Invalidity Pension/DCA</td><td><div>39.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;23.00</div></td><td><div>30,000</div></td><td><div>23,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Non Con &amp; Estates</td><td><div>&#8364;61.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;54.00</div></td><td><div>8,000</div></td><td><div>5,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Con./Transitional Pension</td><td><div>&#8364;63.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;63.00</div></td><td><div>5,000</div></td><td><div>11,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>One Family Parent</td><td><div>&#8364;116.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;92.00</div></td><td><div>90,000</div></td><td><div>73,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widows/Widowers/Survivors &amp; Civil Partners</td><td><div>&#8364;30.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;37.00</div></td><td><div>2,000</div></td><td><div>8,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance Recovery Unit</td><td><div>&#8364;4.000</div></td><td><div>&#8364;2.00</div></td><td><div>2,500</div></td><td><div>4,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td><div>&#8364;72.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;70.00</div></td><td><div>247,000</div></td><td><div>335,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carers</td><td><div>&#8364;12.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;12.00</div></td><td><div>4,000</div></td><td><div>17,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Support</td><td><div>&#8364;12.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;14.00</div></td><td><div>26,000</div></td><td><div>23,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Free Schemes &amp; Others</td><td><div>&#8364;24.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6.00</div></td><td><div>20,000</div></td><td><div>15,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>PRSI                                                             </td><td><div>&#8364;4.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6.00</div></td><td><div>2,500</div></td><td><div>7,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>SWA</td><td><div>&#8364;26.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;14.00</div></td><td><div>200,000</div></td><td><div>122,000</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>&#8364;645.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;501.00</div></td><td><div>985,000</div></td><td><div>917,000</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Under the Fraud Initiative 2011 - 2013, the Department plans to undertake at least two fraud and error surveys each year.  These surveys highlight the risk of non-compliance with the rules of the schemes being surveyed at a particular point in time and enable the Department to target those schemes for stronger control measures, where necessary.  Results are presented in terms of the net rate of fraud and error which refers to the position after account is taken of decreases or increases in weekly rates, termination of payments, transfers to other payments and the position following appeal of any cases affected.</p><p>Fraud and Error Surveys were published on three schemes in 2012 - Jobseekers Benefit, Disability Allowance and One Parent Family Payment and the results were as follows:</p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px">-Jobseekers Benefit<b> - </b>  the net cost of fraud and error in the claims surveyed was found to be 1.6% of expenditure.

A survey on Jobseekers Allowance began in September 2012 and further surveys are planned for 2013.</p><p>The following tables provide details of the number of recipients and the total amount paid under each scheme in 2011 and as requested by the Deputy.</p><p><b>Recipients 2011</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Type of Payment</b></th><th><div><b>Provisional</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><b></b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;000</b></div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>       971,566 </td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>    3,622,767 </td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>       132,396 </td></tr><tr><td>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension</td><td>    1,337,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Death Benefit Pension</td><td>           7,977 </td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grants</td><td>         19,440 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Pensions</b></td><td><b>  6,092,014 </b></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>    2,974,987 </td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>    1,088,897 </td></tr><tr><td>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension</td><td>         18,173 </td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife's Allowance</td><td>           4,211 </td></tr><tr><td>Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance<sup>(2)</sup></td><td>       174,349 </td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>       113,724 </td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Retirement Allowance</td><td>         59,942 </td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>       927,105 </td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife's Benefit</td><td>         85,828 </td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>       309,143 </td></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>           1,075 </td></tr><tr><td>Health and Safety Benefit</td><td>              643 </td></tr><tr><td>Redundancy and Insolvency</td><td>       326,892 </td></tr><tr><td>Treatments Benefits</td><td>         23,042 </td></tr><tr><td>Exceptional Needs and Urgent Payments</td><td>         62,228 </td></tr><tr><td>Other Supplements</td><td>         12,766 </td></tr><tr><td>Humanitarian Aid</td><td>              359 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Working Age Income Supports</b></td><td><b>  6,183,364 </b></td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>       349,396 </td></tr><tr><td>Other Employment Programmes</td><td>         48,180 </td></tr><tr><td>Integration Supports</td><td>         27,158 </td></tr><tr><td>Employment Support Services</td><td>       435,163 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Working Age Employment Supports </b></td><td><b>     859,897 </b></td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>    1,089,178 </td></tr><tr><td>Blind Pension</td><td>         15,625 </td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance</td><td>       507,193 </td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>         99,924 </td></tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant</td><td>       130,392 </td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>       875,641 </td></tr><tr><td>Injury Benefit</td><td>         16,508 </td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>       606,512 </td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Benefit</td><td>         77,460 </td></tr><tr><td>Medical Care Scheme</td><td>              317 </td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Benefit</td><td>         24,474 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Illness, Disability and Caring</b></td><td><b>  3,443,224 </b></td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>2,076,338</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>       204,543 </td></tr><tr><td>Back to School  Clothing and Footwear Allowance</td><td>         90,909 </td></tr><tr><td>School Meals Scheme</td><td>         34,975 </td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory)</td><td>           5,134 </td></tr><tr><td>Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner Grant (Non-Contributory)</td><td>              276 </td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payments (Contributory)</td><td>         11,502 </td></tr><tr><td>Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner Grant (Contributory)</td><td>           6,228 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Children </b></td><td><b>    2,429,905 </b></td></tr><tr><td>Household Benefits and Free Travel<sup>(3)</sup></td><td>       711,011 </td></tr><tr><td>Rent Allowance</td><td>              701 </td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Payments<sup>(3)</sup></td><td>       617,894 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Supplementary Payments</b></td><td><b>    1,329,606 </b></td></tr><tr><td>Administration - Insurance Schemes</td><td>       280,984 </td></tr><tr><td>Administration  - Assistance Schemes</td><td>       348,847 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Administration</b></td><td><b>       629,831 </b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Grand Total</b></td><td><div><b>20,967,841</b></div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The statutory bodies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Board, and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman.  Details of these statutory bodies are set out in the following table.</p><p><b>Statutory Bodies</b></p><p><table><tr><td>Social Welfare Tribunal<br /></td><td>The Social Welfare Tribunal is a statutory body set up in 1982 <br />to deal with cases where entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance is refused due to an involvement in a trade dispute. Where a person feels unreasonably deprived of employment because an employer refused or failed to engage in the mediation process for settling disputes, application may be made to the Tribunal for adjudication on the matter. </td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>The Citizens Information Board</th><th>The Citizens Information Board is the national agency responsible for supporting the provision of information, advice and advocacy on social services and for the provision of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). </th></tr><tr><td>The Pensions Board</td><td>The Pensions Board is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended), which provides for the regulation of occupational pensions and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts. The Board also advises the Minister in relation to pension policy. </td></tr><tr><td>The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman</td><td>The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman investigates complaints of financial losses due to maladministration and disputes of fact or law, in relation to occupational pension schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts. The Pensions Ombudsman is a statutory officer and exercises his functions independently. </td></tr></table></p><p>I understand that the information sought on budgets, employee numbers and so on is required only in respect of bodies abolished or proposed for abolition.  No body under the aegis of my Department has been merged or abolished since the formation of the Government in March 2011.</p><p>The Public Service Reform Programme provides that the integration of the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator and the merging of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman be the subject of a critical review.  The review will include identifying any potential savings arising from such an amalgamation.  The Critical Review Group held its first meeting in July 2012.  I expect to receive a report from the Group by end 2012.  Following receipt of this report, decisions in relation to possible reforms will be taken.</p></reply>

A single statutory NLI and NMI Advisory Council will operate <i>pro bono</i>   in place of the existing boards.  Board membership will be reduced overall by some 60%.  It is anticipated that this model will achieve significant savings and increase efficiencies across the institutions.  The NAI will continue to operate, as currently, with a statutorily independent Director, and a similar governance model will be put in place for the Directors of the NLI and NMI.  A robust shared services model will be deployed - through my Department in relation to corporate support services and by formal inter-institutional agreement in relation to operational services. </p><p>  It is my intention to make clear statutory provision for the independent status of the Director of the NLI and the Director of the NMI.

The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.</p><p>  I am informed by the SEAI that the house in question was surveyed for suitability for attic insulation, at which time it was identified as a dormer bungalow.  The practice of insulating dormer roofs through the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was recently reviewed in respect of value for money, the overall effectiveness of the additional insulation which can only be undertaken in part of the roof space, and the significant costs associated with achieving appropriate ventilation in the roof space to avoid condensation problems.  All of this is in the context of endeavouring to address the maximum number of vulnerable fuel poor homes from within available resources.  On balance it has been decided that the significant costs are not generally justified by the marginal insulation gains.  Therefore insulation of dormer roofs is not currently implemented under the scheme.  However, I am advised that SEAI will continue to keep the matter under review with my officials for feasible cost effective alternatives, particularly where the homes are in extreme fuel poverty, at which time affected houses may be revisited.</p><p>  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hot line can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to  and will be dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

The scheme enables homeowners to save money, while improving comfort and reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER).  Since the scheme commenced in March 2009 the SEAI has disbursed over &euro;145m in grants and supported the installation of over 337,000 such measures in 133,195 homes built pre-2006.

In turn, approximately 12.6% of these households rely solely on the Irish terrestrial channels and a further 5.3% rely on a combination of the Irish terrestrial channels and one or more of the UK terrestrial channels.  The situation across the EU is quite diverse and so a mean or average penetration of subscription television is of little practical use as a metric.  The situation ranges from those countries with over 80% of television users on a subscription model (including Belgium, Denmark, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands Sweden and Hungary) to those countries with around half of the television households on subscription (Germany on 55%, the UK on 53%, Italy on 41% and France on 49%).</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the waste facility permitting, registration and licensing system is to facilitate appropriate controls on waste facilities and activities so as to ensure good and consistent waste management practice and the implementation of high standards of environmental protection.  In addition, under EU animal by-products legislation, composting and anaerobic digestion plants which process food waste are subject to approval by  the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p><p>  My Department&#8217;s role is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework through which the enforcement authorities operate.  The Government&#8217;s new waste policy, <i><i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i></i>, published in July 2012, includes a range of measures to ensure, <i>inter alia</i> , that waste collected in Ireland is managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy as set out in the Waste Framework Directive, whereby prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery are favoured over the disposal of waste.  The work of developing new regulatory structures to give effect to the measures set out in the waste policy , including the use of waste such as organics as a resource, has commenced and my Department is engaging with a range of key stakeholders in relation to the detailed design of the new system. </p><p>  Regulations in relation to food waste arising on commercial premises, the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009, entered into force in July 2010.  These regulations require relevant businesses and public buildings separately to collect all organic food waste to facilitate its diversion from landfill.  Household food waste regulations are currently being finalised which will require the separate collection of such material, supporting its diversion from landfill to more productive uses.  A comprehensive regulatory impact analysis in relation to the proposed household food waste regulations has been prepared and will be published with the associated regulations.  It is my intention that these measures will deliver both enhanced environmental performance and a quality service for consumers.</p></reply>

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</p><p>- Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; </p><p>- Category two, where a receiver has been appointed; </p><p>- Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and </p><p>- Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents. </p><p>  Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i>:</p><p>- the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</p><p>- the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</p><p>- the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</p><p>- the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</p><p>- the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned and,</p><p>- where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with. </p><p>  This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.</p><p>  Only households in developments in categories three and four, as identified in October 2011, are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  It is a matter for the relevant local authority to interpret and apply the relevant provisions. </p><p>  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.   </p></reply>

I believe the categorisation methodology recommended by the Pyrite Panel offers a pragmatic and sensible approach to the remediation of pyrite damaged dwellings. </p><p>  However, the approach recommended in the report refers only to a remediation scheme that would be advanced by a Resolution Board which the Pyrite Panel recommended should be established to deal with pyrite problems where there are no other options available to homeowners for the remediation of their dwellings. </p><p>  Structural defects warranties/insurance schemes are provided by private companies and operate on the basis of a contractual arrangement between the relevant parties.

While my Department does not collect the data sought in the question, local authorities provide the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with annual data on the total number of environmental inspections carried out, including those relating to the plastic bag levy.</p><p>The table below shows the total number of inspections carried out by local authorities in relation to the plastic bag levy for the years 2009 to 2011, as reported by local authorities to the EPA .   Figures for 2012 have not yet been published.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year </div></th><th><div>Number of PBL Inspections </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2009 </div></td><td><div>1,573 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010 </div></td><td><div>800 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011 </div></td><td><div>683 </div></td></tr></table></p><p>In a recent report published by the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office on the Environment Fund Levies ( <i>Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2011</i> ), it was recommended that my Department collate and analyse results of inspections in order to assess the adequacy of the inspection regime and the overall level of compliance indicated by it.  However, I believe that the overall level of inspections carried out by local authorities is sufficient.  As local authorities are the major beneficiaries of the levy, it is in their own best interests to ensure that the levies are collected and enforced effectively.  In addition, plastic bag litter statistics indicate that the current level of inspections is effective in delivering the required environmental outcomes.  The latest figures available (2011) from the National Litter Pollution Monitoring Body show that plastic bag litter accounts for 0.24% of litter arising.  This compares with 5% prior to the levy&rsquo;s introduction.  My Department also monitors per capita usage of leviable plastic bags. Estimates are that prior to the introduction of the levy 328 bags per person were supplied by retailers per annum compared to a level of 18 bags per person per annum in 2010.</p><p>In addition to the role of the local authorities in carrying out environmental enforcement inspections, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is responsible for compliance in relation to the collection of the levy.  Such responsibilities include, inter alia, the identification of accountable persons; carrying out verification checks relating to the accuracy of the returns received; and pursuing accountable persons who fail to deliver returns and payments within the statutory time limits.</p></reply>

The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of my Department and the administration of the Authority is vested in a Board whose membership includes industry representatives.  The key responsibilities of the Authority are to licence and regulate those providing security services and to improve and maintain standards in the provision of these services.</p><p>  I am informed that the Authority issues two types of licence, both of which are valid for a period of two years.  Contractor Licences are required by companies, partnerships and sole traders.  Individual Licences are required by all those working in the security sector within the State whether employed by a licensed contractor or directly by a business as in house security personnel.</p><p>  Regulations were recently introduced to extend licensing to contractors providing security services installing CCTV and access control systems with effect from the 1<sup>st</sup> October 2012.  In accordance with these regulations, all contractors installing and maintaining CCTV and access control systems must be in possession of the appropriate licence(s) or have an application lodged with the Authority.  In order to obtain a licence, a contractor must prove compliance with national and European standards, be tax compliant and undergo criminal record checking.</p><p>  The provision of a regulatory environment understandably leads to cost implications for the industry but the public and the industry itself both benefit from regulation.  The Authority has made every effort to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum and has introduced an instalment payment option to assist contractors with paying for their licence.  The PSA's licence fee structure is monitored by the Authority on a regular basis and I am advised that the Board of the Authority is, in fact, currently reviewing the licence fee.</p><p>  The introduction of regulation to a previously unregulated industry will always present challenges for both the regulator and the industry.  Since its establishment the Authority has brought about a fundamental change in the security industry through a standards based licensing system. <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The Authority is aware of the difficulties faced by the industry at this time and continues to seek ways of easing the burden of regulation while at the same time meeting its statutory obligations.</p></reply>

The Working Group also recommended that periodic payment orders should only be made where the court is satisfied that continuity of payment under the periodic payments order is reasonably secure.</i><br /><br /><i>The successful operation of a statutory scheme for periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure. In this regard the Working Group recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate. Alternatively it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed. The NTMA has concluded an actuarial review on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security of payment principle. The NTMA report is being considered in consultation with the Minister for Finance with a view to the development of legislative proposals.</i></blockquote></p></reply>

I have acknowledged that these historical references are no longer tenable. However, while I am prepared to consider a limited move away from this model, the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for a flat-rate payment go too far and too fast. Therefore my main focus in the CAP reform negotiations is on securing a more measured approach that will limit the gains and losses to Irish farmers, and ensure that the direct payments system continues to provide the foundation for the achievement of the ambitious targets that have been set for the development of the sector.</p></reply>

Following on from the demand for new services and the availability of existing resources in the region, I have decided to consolidate the administrative services that the Department currently provides from the Regional Office in Clonakilty. These services will in future be delivered from the Regional Office in Cork city. </p><p>  The remaining services provided by veterinary and technical staff will continue to be provided from the Clonakilty Office which is being relocated to the Department&rsquo;s Seafood Centre at Clogheen. Staff members who have provided the back-up clerical and administrative functions in the Darrara Office will be transferred to the Marine Division of the Department at Clogheen and will be assigned to new Marine related duties so that there will be no net reduction in the total number of staff working for the Department in Clonakilty. As regards non pay savings, these will be realised during 2013 once my Department&rsquo;s Clonakilty based activities have been consolidated at Clogheen.</p></reply>

The fund will help to deliver the ambitious objectives of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and will assist fishermen in the transition towards sustainable fishing, as well as coastal communities in the diversification of their economies.  </p><p>  At the October 2012 Fisheries Council, the Cyprus Presidency secured agreement on a &ldquo;partial&rdquo; general approach on the financial instrument the EMFF. Ireland will endeavour to achieve a general approach of the Council during its Presidency in the early part of 2013 with a view to securing a political agreement between the Council and EU Parliament by the end of the Irish Presidency.  All the proposals are subject to negotiation and adoption through the co-decision process involving both the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament.</p><p>  In the context of the EMFF Proposal, the EU Commission set down indicative figures for the Fund, however, funding made available will only be finalised following determination of the EU budget which is being discussed at the Leaders Summit later this month. </p><p>  The new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be structured around 4 pillars, a) Smart, Green Fisheries, b) Smart, Green Aquaculture, c) Sustainable and Inclusive Territorial Development and d) Integrated Maritime Policy. </p><p>  Of key importance to Ireland is a reasonable and fair share of the EMFF funding available.  Ireland is supportive of the proposal in relation to the provision of funding for aquaculture, seafood processing, measures that support job creation and the rebuilding and conservation of stocks.  Ireland welcomes the new elements proposed in the partial general approach including giving Member States the option of funding restructuring/decommissioning of the fishing fleet, engine replacement in limited circumstances and support for young fishermen.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s decision on the expenditure ceilings was taken in order to strike a balance between needs and priorities in all Government Departments on a multi-annual basis, to meet the requirements of the overall fiscal commitments which are firmly focused on returning the public finances to a sustainable path and to reduce the General Government Deficit by end 2015.  Budget 2013 will be framed in this framework.</p><p>  The preparations for the 2013 Estimate are currently underway and all budget lines in my Department&rsquo;s Vote are being examined critically as part of that process.

I will be taking full account of the competing priorities when compiling and allocating the funding available for 2013. </p></reply>

The Scheme as operated by this Department defines DAS land under the following:</p><p>  -	Less Severely Handicapped Lowland and Coastal Areas with Specific Handicaps: (payable at &euro;82.27 per forage hectare);</p><p>  -	More Severely Handicapped Lowland: (payable at &euro;95.99 per forage hectare);</p><p>  -	Mountain Type Grazing: (payable at &euro;109.71 on first 10 forage hectares or part thereof and &euro;95.99 per hectare on remaining forage hectares). </p><p>  It can be seen from the above classifications and rates payable that due recognition is given to the varying degrees of disadvantage which farmers face, depending on the area of the country in which they farm.  Furthermore, the area of the country classified as disadvantaged represents approximately 75% of farmland; this designation ranges from whole counties being designated as disadvantaged, some counties being partially designated, to those counties with no designated land.  In the case of the two counties mentioned, Leitrim and Meath, the entire of County Leitrim is classified as disadvantaged (the entire county being classified as More Severely Handicapped), while a very small portion of County Meath is classified as disadvantaged (approximately 14%), the areas classified as disadvantaged being defined as Less Severely Handicapped, in the main, with a small area defined as More Severely Handicapped.</p><p>  In recognition of the physical and natural constrains occurring in areas designated as disadvantaged, farmers area required to maintain a very low minimum stocking density on their holdings; under the 2012 Scheme the requirement is to maintain a minimum stocking density per forage hectare of 0.15 livestock units for a minimum retention period of six consecutive months, in addition to which applicants must maintain an annual average of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare over the 12 months of the Scheme year.  This minimum stocking requirement equates with a stocking level of one ewe per hectare. In most areas, where the farmers are predominantly involved in livestock production, the average stocking density is well over 1.0 livestock units per hectare (lu/ha) and in many of these areas over 2.0 lu/ha.</p><p>  Furthermore, provision is made for those farmers whose adherence to recognised environmental protection plans (REPS, etc) oblige them to maintain a stocking density lower than 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare; in such cases this Department accepts the lower stocking level as meeting the requirements of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining the universal free pre-school year.  </p><p>  In the current pre-school year approximately 65,700 children are availing of the ECCE programme. This figure will increase as late entrant applications to the programme are submitted and processed. &euro;175.8 million has been provided in 2012 to cover the cost of the programme. </p><p>  I am aware of the need to further develop the early childhood care and education sector.  However, any development that involved expanding the pre-school year would require considerable additional funding.

These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the preschool year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.  However, there is no provision under the programme for a second preschool year for any child.  As the child in question has availed of the full free preschool complement in the academic year 2011/2012, there is no further entitlement under the ECCE programme.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will, of course, be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.</p></reply>

Through the framework of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, the Department of Health is working in collaboration with the relevant statutory agencies to monitor the availability of controlled drugs, including prescription medicines, through illicit channels.</p><p>  The enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse in this jurisdiction.</p><p>  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.  The Regulations also make it illegal for prescription medicines to be supplied by mail order.  The definition of mail order includes reference to electronic custom solicitation and order for supply.  This includes ordering prescription medicines through internet sites.  Furthermore, a person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a substance controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it, is guilty of an offence under that legislation.  </p><p>  My Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to introducing additional controls on certain prescription drugs being traded illicitly, for example benzodiazepine medicines.  These additional controls include introducing import and export controls as well as an offence of possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  My Department is consulting with key stakeholders in relation to the proposed amendments and it is anticipated that new legislation will be introduced by early 2013.</p></reply>

Up to &#8364;3 million of the fund will be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and a cost of &#8364;5 million has been estimated to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.  The remaining &#8364;2 million will be made available to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with <i>A Vision for Change. </i></p><p>  414 posts were approved to implement the &#8364;35 million package of special measures for mental health.  378 of the posts are with the National Recruitment Service of the HSE at various stages in the recruitment process and over 200 offers of employment have already been accepted and the appointments are proceeding.  Most start dates are expected to be in December 2012 to allow for the process of checking references etc. and costs will start to be incurred from that point.

The SDU's Scheduled Care Team was tasked with improving access to elective surgery and lowering waiting lists and the most recent Progress Report on the New Access Targets, which set out progress towards the targets by the end of Q3, shows the following.</p><p><b><i>In-patient and daycase surgery</i></b></p><p>Overall waiting list numbers have decreased from 56, 020 to 51, 955, a drop of 7%; the number of adults having to wait more than 12 months is down from 2,732 to 408, a drop of 85%; the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months is down from 6,277 to 2,342, a drop of 63%; the number of children having to wait &gt; 20 weeks is down from 1,712 to 670 a decrease of 61%.</p><p><b><i>GI endoscopy </i></b></p><p>  The SDU began to tackle long waits for routine GI endoscopy services (i.e. scopes) in May 2012 and since May 2012 overall waiting list numbers for scopes have decreased from 13,349 to  8, 904, a drop of 33%.  Those having to wait &gt; 3 months (the target for 2012) have decreased from 5,062 to 1,711, a drop of 66% </p><p><b><i>Outpatients</i></b>  The initial priority for the SDU was trolley waits and daycases. It has now begun to work on improving access to outpatient services.  The SDU is now working with the NTPF to build on the current work being undertaken by the HSE and to begin the systematic collection of outpatient waiting time data at an individual patient level. The collation and analysis of OP waiting time data in this standardised format will enable the SDU and NTPF to target resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of OP services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.</p></reply>

The number of health service staff has fallen from a peak of 111,000 in 2007 to less than 103,000 now.  As we are all aware, the country still faces serious challenges in respect of the public finances, and in order to meet the targets agreed with the Troika, there will be further reductions in the level of resources allocated to the health sector.</p><p>  The 2010 Budget for the health services provided for &#8364;659m in pay savings and &#8364;400m in non-pay savings.  The <i>pay savings</i> of &#8364;659m took account of general pay reductions, and higher reductions for those on higher pay on foot of the Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration along with savings associated with the moratorium on recruitment and promotion. The <i>non-pay savings</i>   of &#8364;400m concentrated on areas which would not have a significant impact on front-line services, such as reductions in drugs costs, further economies in areas such as procurement, and improved private income collection by public hospitals.  In 2011 further price reductions were applied in relation to pharmaceuticals, to achieve full year savings of &#8364;200 million in the cost of drugs.  Further reductions in GP fees under the Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 were applied, and the charge for treating private patients in public hospitals was increased by 21%.  Along with further procurement economies, and reductions in pay as a result of the voluntary exit schemes, the objective was to mitigate as far as possible against affecting front-line services. </p><p>  Expenditure plans for 2012 were set in the context of stabilising the fiscal situation whilst protecting services to the greatest degree possible. As with other sectors, the Health sector incurred a reduction in the resources allocated to it. The gross current budget for the Health Sector for 2012 was some &#8364;183m less than the 2011 allocation. However, the underlying reduction was greater because of the need to provide for unavoidable cost increases in areas such as superannuation, demand-led schemes and Fair Deal. There was also a need to commence implementation of some priority commitments in the Programme for Government. The HSE's National Service Plan indicated that in order to meet the Government's targets and to provide for unavoidable pressures, savings of &#8364;750m will need to be achieved in 2012. </p><p>  The HSE is overspent by &#8364;374m to the end of September.  There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the excess expenditure.  In the short term, to address the 2012 position, I have instructed the Executive to impose cash limits on agency and overtime. Furthermore, there will be more rigorous management of absenteeism, travel and subsistence will be limited, and stock management will be intensified in order to better manage cash. Other measures are also being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget, including the use of capital to fund revenue and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis. </p><p>  As I have outlined in this House on previous occasions, I have instructed the HSE that efficiencies must be achieved in the first instance before patient services are affected and in this regard, patient safety must be paramount.</p></reply>

Their report was presented to me on 8 June last. On Tuesday, I announced the Government&rsquo;s decision to develop the new children&rsquo;s hospital at the campus of St James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin. In identifying the new site, the Government has carefully considered the report of the Dolphin Group along with detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.</p><p>  This decision has been made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations being of paramount importance. It is essential that the new children&rsquo;s hospital can deliver best clinical outcomes for our children. Co-location with an adult hospital has been deemed essential by the Dolphin report, and by all previous reports on this issue, while tri-location with a maternity hospital is optimal. Greenfield sites do not offer this opportunity and therefore the Dolphin report excluded greenfield sites from consideration. Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.</p><p>  I intend to move quickly now to put in place all the necessary structures and governance arrangements to enable the delivery of this project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality. This Government regards the building of the new children&rsquo;s hospital as a key priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion. </p></reply>

Historically, public nursing homes have employed a greater number of nursing staff and, therefore, had higher nursing to patient ratios than many nursing homes in the private sector. This has contributed to the higher cost of care. With regard to dependency levels, the Long-Stay Activity Statistics for 2010,   prepared by the Department of Health, indicate that at end-2010, 83.7% of residents in public nursing homes were of high and maximum dependency. In private nursing homes, 59.7% of residents were in the same category. The Deputy should be mindful that these are self-reported survey results. However, the HSE is committed to implementing a single assessment tool for older people. In addition to uniformly assess dependency levels, the introduction of such a tool would enhance quality and efficiency, promote value for money, facilitate access to long-term residential care and community services and ensure that older people are cared for in the most appropriate setting.</p><p>  The HSE is committed to examining all options to maximise the resources available for nursing home care, e.g. skill mix, rostering arrangements and reconfiguration etc. The HSE is currently finalising a review of the cost of care in public nursing homes. </p><p>Finally, the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which is expected to be completed in 2013, will examine the   overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices.</p></reply>

The Council (also known as CORU) was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act.</p><p>  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31 May, 2011. A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16 December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future. Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board,  the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board are currently in the process of establishment and it is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.</p><p>  All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015 or 2016 at the latest.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. e name of every registrant will be published in the register, which will be accessible on-line.  Only those registrants who have satisfied the registration board for their designated profession that they hold an approved qualification and are &quot;fit and proper&quot; to engage in the practice of the profession will be entered on the register.</p><p>  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) and will continue to do so on a reducing basis to end 2015.</p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees and in doing this it is mindful of the requirement for it to become self funding by end 2015. </p><p>  The current fee structure is as follows:</p><p>  -  A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;</p><p>  -  An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.</p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax which compares favourably with fees levied by Union and professional bodies where no tax relief is applicable.</p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income. e greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing,  for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum. Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act,  registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the bare minimum required to enable the Council to operate. The fee is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. </p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:</p><p>-   Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grand-parenting, the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grand-parenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grand-parenting. is concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;</p><p>-   The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;</p><p>-  Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system. is will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

The supports provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to people with HD involve a multi-disciplinary team approach to the provision of health and personal supports and incorporates assisted living services, including Personal Assistant Services, Aids &amp; Appliances and hospital, primary care and community services.  </p><p>  The Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland (HDAI), provides consultation, information and individualised support to those diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, their families and their health care team.  The HSE is committed to working in partnership with voluntary disability service providers, including HDAI, to ensure that all of the resources available for people with disabilities are used in the most effective manner possible.  The HSE recognises the valuable contribution of the HDAI and approved a grant of just over &euro;68,000 for 2012 to support the work of the organisation.  The HDAI is a member of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and the Disability Federation of Ireland.  Both umbrella organisations provide support to the HDAI and are supported by the State through funding from the Health Service Executive.</p><p>  I established a National Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and a patient centred approach.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the EU Council Recommendations on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  It is envisaged that the main added value of European Reference Networks and therefore of the Centres of Expertise will be to facilitate improvements in access to diagnosis and delivery of high-quality, accessible and cost-effective healthcare in the case of patients who have a medical condition requiring a particular concentration of expertise or resources, particularly in medical domains where expertise is rare. Work is ongoing on at EU level on the development of criteria, structures and governance arrangements for such networks and the Department of Health is participating in the relevant Expert Groups.</p><p>  My Department is asking the HSE to inform the Deputies in relation to the provision of services for people with Huntington&rsquo;s Disease in the Western region.</p></reply>

The level of rent qualifying for rent relief depends on an individual&rsquo;s marital status and age.   In Budget 2011, it was announced that rent relief was being withdrawn on a phased basis. No new claimants were allowed from 7 December 2010 but existing claimants will continue to receive the relief, on a reducing basis, with a complete cessation of the relief from 2018. This is in line with the schedule proposed for the withdrawal of mortgage interest relief. The scheduled withdrawal of rent relief is set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Tax Year</div></th><th><div>Reduction %</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>20%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>20%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>10%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>10%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2015</div></td><td><div>10%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2016</div></td><td><div>10%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2017</div></td><td><div>10%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2018</div></td><td><div>10% to 0%</div></td></tr></table></p><p>To phase out the remaining 60% of the relief over the next 3 years i.e. 2013 &ndash; 2015, would result in the following yields based on the 2010 costs of the scheme. A standard level of reduction of 20% per annum on the remaining maximum levels of relief is assumed.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Tax Year</div></th><th><div>Reduction %</div></th><th><div>Total Yield <br />&#8364;M</div></th><th><div>Increase in yield over existing reduction <br />&#8364;M</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>20%</div></td><td><div>49.7</div></td><td><div>8.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>20%</div></td><td><div>66.2</div></td><td><div>16.5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2015</div></td><td><div>20% to 0</div></td><td><div>82.8</div></td><td><div>24.8</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to the tax year 2010, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available, is approximately &euro;1.3 million. However, this figure does not take account of the application of the high income individuals&rsquo; restriction to specified reliefs, including the artists' exemption and thus the actual yield could be lower. The restriction was originally provided for in Finance Act 2006 and was significantly tightened in Finance Act 2010. Individuals are now subject to the restriction where they have adjusted income of    &euro;125,000 and claim specified tax reliefs of &euro;80,000 or more. Those subject to the full restriction now pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and Universal Social Charge.</p><p>  In addition, it must be stressed that this estimate assumes no significant behavioural change on the part of the affected taxpayers. Moreover, the application of income tax to this income source could also lead to additional claims being made for expenses and allowances by persons currently exempt.</p></reply>

The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions. A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &mdash; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &mdash; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.</p><p>However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 to the thresholds outlined in the question, and at the various specified marginal tax rates, in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be as shown in the following table.</p><p><pfli1>          <bu>Exchequer Yield</bu></pfli1></p><p><bu>Reduced Earnings Cap</bu><b>                </b>  <bu>Reduction in Relief  Allowable at specified   </bu></p><p>(below &euro;115,000)                                                            <bu>Marginal Tax Rates </bu></p><p><b></b></p><p><table><tr><th>&#8364;</th><th><div>Current Rate</div></th><th><div>34%</div></th><th><div>30%</div></th><th><div>20%</div></th></tr><tr><td>&#8364;100,000</td><td><div>&#8364;35m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;155m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;244m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;490m</div></td></tr><tr><td>&#8364;90,000</td><td><div>&#8364;65m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;165m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;274m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;510m</div></td></tr><tr><td>&#8364;80,000</td><td><div>&#8364;95m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;210m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;300m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;535m</div></td></tr><tr><td>&#8364;70,000</td><td><div>&#8364;130m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;240m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;329m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;555m</div></td></tr><tr><td>&#8364;60,000</td><td><div>&#8364;175m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;265m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;354m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;580m</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It may, broadly, be interpreted as meaning residence in a particular country with the intention of residing permanently in that country.  An individual acquires a domicile of origin on his/her birth.  Whilst each individual has a domicile, that domicile may or may not be the country in which he or she is tax resident.    An individual is not entitled to claim exemption from Irish tax solely by reason of being non-Irish domiciled.  An individual&rsquo;s liability to Irish tax is affected by an individual&rsquo;s residence, ordinary residence and domicile.  It is not possible to determine how much tax is foregone by reason of an individual claiming to be non-Irish domiciled. </p><p>  I am assuming that the reference to changes in Budget 2012 refers to the amendment to the Domicile Levy legislation announced in Budget 2012 and implemented in section 136 Finance Act 2012.  The Domicile Levy was introduced in the Finance Act 2010 and was charged on an individual: who in any year was Irish domiciled and an Irish citizen; whose worldwide income for the year exceeds &euro;1m; whose Irish located property in the year is greater than &euro;5m, and whose liability to Irish income tax for the year is less than &euro;200,000.</p><p>  Where a relevant person has paid Irish income tax for a year that person is entitled to a credit for the income tax paid in calculating the amount of the domicile levy for that year.</p><p>  The amendment introduced in section 136 Finance Act 2012 removed the requirement to be an Irish citizen. The affect of this amendment is that persons who meet the other criteria will be liable to the levy whether or not they are Irish citizens. The returns for the tax year 2012 will be the first returns affected by the amendment.  These returns are due to be filed on or before 31 October 2013 or in the case of persons filing their income tax returns using the Revenue Online System (ROS) on or before 15 November 2013. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as the filing deadline has not expired it is not possible at this point to determine how many persons this measure will affect for the tax year 2012.</p></reply>

In that year, an estimated 2,350 claimants availed of the artists&rsquo; exemption scheme at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of &euro;9.6 million. It should be noted that this figure takes account of the high income individuals' restriction which took effect for the first time in 2007. The impact of the measure in the income tax year 2010 was to reduce the value of the income tax relief under the artists' exemption by &euro;8.3 million.   The high income individuals' restriction was originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006 and was significantly tightened in Section 23 of Finance Act 2010. Individuals are now subject to the restriction where they have adjusted income of &euro;125,000 and claim specified tax reliefs of &euro;80,000 or more. Those subject to the full restriction now pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and Universal Social Charge.</p></reply>

The SEIS provides a higher rate of relief for qualifying investments in early stage enterprises, than is available under EIS and was introduced with effect from the 6th of April this year.   We have a similar incentive to the EIS called the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII), which commenced on 25 November 2011, following the receipt of State Aid approval from the European Commission. The EII provides tax relief of 30% on investments made in small and certain medium-sized enterprises, including early stage enterprises, with the possibility of a further 11% in tax relief at the end of a three year holding period. The incentive was previously known as the Business Expansion Scheme and was significantly amended to target limited Exchequer resources towards job creation. As part of these changes, access to the incentive was made available to the majority of small and medium-sized companies (SMEs).</p><p>  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that the level of funding raised by SMEs under the Business Expansion Scheme has been declining since 2008. This could be related to the economic downturn or to a lower appetite for risk among investors. It is too early to say whether the changes brought about by the introduction of EII will have the desired affect and halt such decline. However, the peak period for raising investments under EII is November/December and a better picture of the impact of the changes should be available next year.</p><p>  The introduction of any scheme that would provide higher tax relief for investments in certain companies could have the capacity to skew investments towards such companies. This could work to the detriment of other equally deserving companies that need to raise risk capital investments. Ultimately, the priority of the Government is to incentivise investments where they are most likely to create jobs. Therefore, I am inclined to be cautious as regards implementing further changes to the tax incentives available for such investments at the current time.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.</p><p>  My Department's Circular 0071/2011 provides further details in relation to the terms and conditions of employment for SNAs, including clarification in relation to SNA duties and work which may be performed during non instructive days, or delivered by an SNA outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.  Once an SNA allocation has been made to a school, the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management of a school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated, and in accordance with the terms of the scheme as set out in my Departments Circular.  In circumstances where a parent may have a concern about the manner in which an SNA is being deployed in a school, they should raise this matter with the school Principal/Board of Management of the school in the first instance. </p></reply>

The school is seeking to have permanent recognition granted and a process is in place under which the issue of recognition is being assessed.  This process is based on ten undertakings committed to by the school's Patron in 2007 in accordance with the requirements of the Education Act 1998 and the Rules for National Schools.</p><p>  My Department recently met with the school authorities to discuss the school's current position in relation to the undertakings concerned.  I understand that while issues remain to be resolved, substantial progress has been made by the school in relation to most of the undertakings and that my officials and the school are working together with a view to enabling the school to meet the permanent recognition criteria as soon as possible.  It is very important to note that the decision regarding full recognition depends upon the satisfactory implementation by the Patron of all the undertakings.</p></reply>

The redeployment arrangements include provision for flexibility of movement between panels in order to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers.  Otherwise, any transfers between panels are dealt with by agreement between the relevant patrons.  Redeployment arrangements for surplus post-primary teachers were introduced as part of the implementation of particular aspects of the Croke Park Agreement.  The parties identified that voluntary movement, if provided for, could assist the operation of the main redeployment arrangements.  It is agreed that further discussions would take place with a view to putting a pilot scheme in place and these discussions are ongoing under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council.</p></reply>

The waiting time for processing a student grant application by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) varies, depending on a number of factors including the volume of applications received at any given time, the complexity of the grant applicants circumstances, and time taken by the applicant to submit all the required documentary evidence to enable a final decision to be made on an application.  Every effort is made to ensure that students get decisions on their grant applications as soon as possible.</p><p>Appeals received by SUSI are dealt with in date order and the waiting time for decisions on appeals can vary depending on the complexity of the grant applicants circumstances which are under appeal.

The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.  The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.</p><p>  Every school therefore must have in place a policy, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p><p>  In terms of other training I am very aware of the importance of appropriate teacher training and support in this and other aspects of teachers' day to day work with children.  In this regard, initial teacher education plays a huge role in training our teachers and ensuring that they are aware of the developmental and emotional needs of their students.  As part of their lifelong journey, teachers engage in ongoing professional development (CPD) and this will become a statutory requirement in the near future. CPD helps to ensure that teachers are aware of current research and best practice in working with young people.  In the area of anti-bullying, the Deputy will be aware that my Department currently funds the Social Personal &amp; Health Education (SPHE) Support Service which provides support for post primary schools including training courses on positive strategies for managing bullying issues.  Schools are also supported in the review of their anti-bullying policies and practices.</p><p>  At primary level, my Department's support services provide ongoing training and support to teachers and principals in the implementation of SPHE and the Stay Safe Programme, which includes a specific module on bullying.</p><p>  In addition to these support services, individual schools have autonomy to determine whether they wish to supplement or support the school's work in the area of anti-bullying with other external resources/materials as appropriate.</p><p>  As the Deputy knows, I am very aware of the need to tackle bullying and it was for that reason that an Anti-Bullying Forum was held in May this year.</p><p>  As a follow on to that Forum, I invited the stakeholders and any other interested parties to submit their views on this important topic to my Department by 29th June 2012.  I understand that the Anti-Bullying Campaign has made a submission as have many other interested parties.  </p><p>  I have also established a working group to address the issue of tackling bullying in schools, including cyber-bullying.  During the course of its work, the working group will be considering the outcomes from the Anti-Bullying Forum together with the submissions received.  Over the last few months, the working group has been consulting with a range of stakeholders and with counterparts  in Scotland and the UK.  The Group is working on an action plan recommending further measures that can be taken to effectively tackle bullying in schools.  The Group expects to complete its work by the end of the year.</p></reply>

This body will be funded from the contributions of the religious congregations offered in response to the request for additional contributions, following the publication of the Ryan Report.  The legislation also provides for the dissolution of the Education Finance Board, which has almost exhausted the &#8364;12.7 million available to it, and the transfer of any remaining functions of the Education Finance Board to the new Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board.</p></reply>

The electrical services were upgraded and the heating system was replaced.  The historic rooms of the house were redisplayed and reinterpreted, new areas of the building were made accessible to the public and a space for temporary exhibitions was provided.  The caf&eacute; in the courtyard of St. Enda's Park was renovated in 2010 at a cost of &euro;340,447, including VAT.  The caf&eacute; is now open all year round for visitors to the Pearse Museum and St. Enda's Park.  A project is under way to repair one of the bridges in St. Enda's Park and replace a second one at a total cost of &euro;50,000.  It is hoped that an exhibition on the life of P.H. Pearse will be installed in the renovated basement in the coming years subject to funds being available.  Plans for the conservation of a number of the garden buildings in the park also await funding.</p></reply>

The pay range profile has been updated since my reply to reflect the significant reductions in the numbers of public servants in the 1st quarter of 2012 and the current pay data profile (based on 292,000 whole time equivalent public servants) is referenced in detail in my replies to Question Nos. 39603, 39605 and 39606/12 of 19 September 2012 and 41225/12 of 27 September 2012. </p><p>  Based on the current numbers and pay range profile available to my Department, the estimated full year gross saving in the Exchequer and Local Government pay bill arising from a cap of &euro;100,000 is &euro;290m. The estimate takes account of the reductions in pay arising from the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, 2009, but does not take account of any offsetting reductions in taxes and levies. As the combined effect of the estimated marginal tax rate and the pension related reduction at a pay level for a public servant of &euro;100,000 p.a. or higher is at least 62.5%, the estimated net savings would be reduced to less than &euro;110m</p><p>  Estimates are based on basic salary range (excluding premium pay and allowances) but include employer&rsquo;s pay related social insurance. The Exchequer pay bill estimates include public servants serving in the Health Service Executive, Vocational Educational Committees and non commercial State agencies/bodies.  They do not include staff of commercial State -sponsored bodies or bodies funded by the State outside the public service since the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform  is not responsible for setting the rate of pay for employees (other than the Chief Executives of the commercial semi-State bodies) outside the public service. </p><p>  As the estimates are based on aggregated data across both the Exchequer funded and Local Authority funded pay bills, detailed data in the format sought by the Deputy (broken down by sector, State body, Department or unit) is a matter for the respective Minister responsible for the Department/Bodies concerned.</p></reply>

The average public service pension is estimated at around &euro;25,000 and many of these pensioners do not have any entitlement to the social welfare pension.  I would add that there would be legal issues arising from a proposal to introduce a 100% reduction for pensions above a certain level.  The changes in rates and bands proposed by the Deputy would save approximately &euro;10 million in a full year.  This figure would be reduced by the application of taxation.</p></reply>

At present, the position is that the 2010 legislation provides, with effect from 1 January 2011, for an average reduction of about 4% of pension, calculated in line with the following rates and bands:</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px"><table><tr><th>Annual Public Service Pension (&#8364;)</th><th>Reduction Rate</th></tr><tr><td>First 12,000</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Between 12,000 and 24,000</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Between 24,000 and 60,000</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Between 60,000 and 100,000</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>Balance above 100,000</td><td>20%</td></tr></table></div></p><p>I legislated last year to add the 20% rate for the over &euro;100,000 band with effect from 1 January 2012.</p><p>The measure secures annual savings estimated at &euro;100 million and applies to over 130,000 pensioners.  The PSPR applies to former civil and public servants and to the survivors pensions of spouses and children of former public servants.  The measure is tapered to mitigate the effect on the lowest level of pension income and is consequently progressive in nature.  Former public servants in receipt of high rates of superannuation benefit, including former members of the Government and the Oireachtas and other office holders, including the Judiciary, have and will bear the highest reduction.</p><p>The preamble to the 2010 legislation clearly establishes the PSPR as an emergency measure taken in the context of the financial and budgetary situation pertaining.  There are also significant safeguards built into the Statute, including an annual review and report which must be laid before the Oireachtas in June each year, as well as provision for me as Minister to examine cases for full or partial exemption and to remove doubts, where appropriate.</p></reply>

The statutory bodies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Board, and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman.  Details of these statutory bodies are set out in the following table.</p><p><b>Statutory Bodies</b></p><p><table><tr><td>Social Welfare Tribunal<br /></td><td>The Social Welfare Tribunal is a statutory body set up in 1982 <br />to deal with cases where entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance is refused due to an involvement in a trade dispute. Where a person feels unreasonably deprived of employment because an employer refused or failed to engage in the mediation process for settling disputes, application may be made to the Tribunal for adjudication on the matter. </td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>The Citizens Information Board</th><th>The Citizens Information Board is the national agency responsible for supporting the provision of information, advice and advocacy on social services and for the provision of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). </th></tr><tr><td>The Pensions Board</td><td>The Pensions Board is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended), which provides for the regulation of occupational pensions and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts. The Board also advises the Minister in relation to pension policy. </td></tr><tr><td>The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman</td><td>The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman investigates complaints of financial losses due to maladministration and disputes of fact or law, in relation to occupational pension schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts. The Pensions Ombudsman is a statutory officer and exercises his functions independently. </td></tr></table></p><p>I understand that the information sought on budgets, employee numbers and so on is required only in respect of bodies abolished or proposed for abolition.  No body under the aegis of my Department has been merged or abolished since the formation of the Government in March 2011.</p><p>The Public Service Reform Programme provides that the integration of the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator and the merging of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman be the subject of a critical review.  The review will include identifying any potential savings arising from such an amalgamation.  The Critical Review Group held its first meeting in July 2012.  I expect to receive a report from the Group by end 2012.  Following receipt of this report, decisions in relation to possible reforms will be taken.</p></reply>

The National Archives Advisory Council will be retained, with a reduced membership operating <i>pro bono</i>.  A single statutory NLI and NMI Advisory Council will operate <i>pro bono</i>   in place of the existing boards.  Board membership will be reduced overall by some 60%.  It is anticipated that this model will achieve significant savings and increase efficiencies across the institutions.  The NAI will continue to operate, as currently, with a statutorily independent Director, and a similar governance model will be put in place for the Directors of the NLI and NMI.  A robust shared services model will be deployed - through my Department in relation to corporate support services and by formal inter-institutional agreement in relation to operational services. </p><p>  It is my intention to make clear statutory provision for the independent status of the Director of the NLI and the Director of the NMI.  Issues such as the status of staff (whether as civil or public servants) and related administrative matters will be pursued at the appropriate time with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the institutions and relevant staff associations/unions.</p></reply>

The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.</p><p>  I am informed by the SEAI that the house in question was surveyed for suitability for attic insulation, at which time it was identified as a dormer bungalow.  The practice of insulating dormer roofs through the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was recently reviewed in respect of value for money, the overall effectiveness of the additional insulation which can only be undertaken in part of the roof space, and the significant costs associated with achieving appropriate ventilation in the roof space to avoid condensation problems.  All of this is in the context of endeavouring to address the maximum number of vulnerable fuel poor homes from within available resources.  On balance it has been decided that the significant costs are not generally justified by the marginal insulation gains.  Therefore insulation of dormer roofs is not currently implemented under the scheme.  However, I am advised that SEAI will continue to keep the matter under review with my officials for feasible cost effective alternatives, particularly where the homes are in extreme fuel poverty, at which time affected houses may be revisited.</p><p>  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hot line can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to  and will be dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

In turn, approximately 12.6% of these households rely solely on the Irish terrestrial channels and a further 5.3% rely on a combination of the Irish terrestrial channels and one or more of the UK terrestrial channels.  The situation across the EU is quite diverse and so a mean or average penetration of subscription television is of little practical use as a metric.  The situation ranges from those countries with over 80% of television users on a subscription model (including Belgium, Denmark, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands Sweden and Hungary) to those countries with around half of the television households on subscription (Germany on 55%, the UK on 53%, Italy on 41% and France on 49%).</p></reply>

The treatment and management of waste material is subject to a registration and permitting system by local authorities or licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency, as appropriate, and is governed by the Waste Management (Facility Permit &amp; Registration) Regulations 2007, as amended or the Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations 2004 to 2011, as appropriate.  The primary purpose of the waste facility permitting, registration and licensing system is to facilitate appropriate controls on waste facilities and activities so as to ensure good and consistent waste management practice and the implementation of high standards of environmental protection.  In addition, under EU animal by-products legislation, composting and anaerobic digestion plants which process food waste are subject to approval by  the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p><p>  My Department&#8217;s role is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework through which the enforcement authorities operate.  The Government&#8217;s new waste policy, <i><i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i></i>, published in July 2012, includes a range of measures to ensure, <i>inter alia</i> , that waste collected in Ireland is managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy as set out in the Waste Framework Directive, whereby prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery are favoured over the disposal of waste.  The work of developing new regulatory structures to give effect to the measures set out in the waste policy , including the use of waste such as organics as a resource, has commenced and my Department is engaging with a range of key stakeholders in relation to the detailed design of the new system. </p><p>  Regulations in relation to food waste arising on commercial premises, the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009, entered into force in July 2010.  These regulations require relevant businesses and public buildings separately to collect all organic food waste to facilitate its diversion from landfill.  Household food waste regulations are currently being finalised which will require the separate collection of such material, supporting its diversion from landfill to more productive uses.  A comprehensive regulatory impact analysis in relation to the proposed household food waste regulations has been prepared and will be published with the associated regulations.  It is my intention that these measures will deliver both enhanced environmental performance and a quality service for consumers.</p></reply>

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</p><p>- Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; </p><p>- Category two, where a receiver has been appointed; </p><p>- Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and </p><p>- Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents. </p><p>  Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i>:</p><p>- the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</p><p>- the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</p><p>- the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</p><p>- the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</p><p>- the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned and,</p><p>- where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with. </p><p>  This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.</p><p>  Only households in developments in categories three and four, as identified in October 2011, are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  It is a matter for the relevant local authority to interpret and apply the relevant provisions. </p><p>  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.   </p></reply>

While my Department does not collect the data sought in the question, local authorities provide the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with annual data on the total number of environmental inspections carried out, including those relating to the plastic bag levy.</p><p>The table below shows the total number of inspections carried out by local authorities in relation to the plastic bag levy for the years 2009 to 2011, as reported by local authorities to the EPA .   Figures for 2012 have not yet been published.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year </div></th><th><div>Number of PBL Inspections </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2009 </div></td><td><div>1,573 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010 </div></td><td><div>800 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011 </div></td><td><div>683 </div></td></tr></table></p><p>In a recent report published by the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office on the Environment Fund Levies ( <i>Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2011</i> ), it was recommended that my Department collate and analyse results of inspections in order to assess the adequacy of the inspection regime and the overall level of compliance indicated by it.  However, I believe that the overall level of inspections carried out by local authorities is sufficient.  As local authorities are the major beneficiaries of the levy, it is in their own best interests to ensure that the levies are collected and enforced effectively.  In addition, plastic bag litter statistics indicate that the current level of inspections is effective in delivering the required environmental outcomes.  The latest figures available (2011) from the National Litter Pollution Monitoring Body show that plastic bag litter accounts for 0.24% of litter arising.  This compares with 5% prior to the levy&rsquo;s introduction.  My Department also monitors per capita usage of leviable plastic bags. Estimates are that prior to the introduction of the levy 328 bags per person were supplied by retailers per annum compared to a level of 18 bags per person per annum in 2010.</p><p>In addition to the role of the local authorities in carrying out environmental enforcement inspections, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is responsible for compliance in relation to the collection of the levy.  Such responsibilities include, inter alia, the identification of accountable persons; carrying out verification checks relating to the accuracy of the returns received; and pursuing accountable persons who fail to deliver returns and payments within the statutory time limits.</p></reply>

The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of my Department and the administration of the Authority is vested in a Board whose membership includes industry representatives.  The key responsibilities of the Authority are to licence and regulate those providing security services and to improve and maintain standards in the provision of these services.</p><p>  I am informed that the Authority issues two types of licence, both of which are valid for a period of two years.  Contractor Licences are required by companies, partnerships and sole traders.  Individual Licences are required by all those working in the security sector within the State whether employed by a licensed contractor or directly by a business as in house security personnel.</p><p>  Regulations were recently introduced to extend licensing to contractors providing security services installing CCTV and access control systems with effect from the 1<sup>st</sup> October 2012.  In accordance with these regulations, all contractors installing and maintaining CCTV and access control systems must be in possession of the appropriate licence(s) or have an application lodged with the Authority.  In order to obtain a licence, a contractor must prove compliance with national and European standards, be tax compliant and undergo criminal record checking.</p><p>  The provision of a regulatory environment understandably leads to cost implications for the industry but the public and the industry itself both benefit from regulation.  The Authority has made every effort to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum and has introduced an instalment payment option to assist contractors with paying for their licence.  The PSA's licence fee structure is monitored by the Authority on a regular basis and I am advised that the Board of the Authority is, in fact, currently reviewing the licence fee.</p><p>  The introduction of regulation to a previously unregulated industry will always present challenges for both the regulator and the industry.

The Working Group also recommended that periodic payment orders should only be made where the court is satisfied that continuity of payment under the periodic payments order is reasonably secure.</i><br /><br /><i>The successful operation of a statutory scheme for periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure. In this regard the Working Group recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate. Alternatively it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed. The NTMA has concluded an actuarial review on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security of payment principle. The NTMA report is being considered in consultation with the Minister for Finance with a view to the development of legislative proposals.</i></blockquote></p></reply>

In July this year, I accepted the Chief of Staff and Secretary General&rsquo;s recommendation regarding new PDF structures and announced the details. Implementation of these revised organisational structures is ongoing.</p><p>Measures to reduce costs and deliver greater efficiencies over the past three years have also included a further rationalisation and consolidation of the Defence property portfolio.<b> </b>  Regarding the recent closure of the four military barracks - Clonmel, Cavan, Mullingar and Castlebar, military personnel occupied on security and support functions within these installations have been released for operational duties leading to a manpower efficiency gain of around &euro;5 million p.a.

I have acknowledged that these historical references are no longer tenable. However, while I am prepared to consider a limited move away from this model, the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for a flat-rate payment go too far and too fast.

The fund will help to deliver the ambitious objectives of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and will assist fishermen in the transition towards sustainable fishing, as well as coastal communities in the diversification of their economies.  </p><p>  At the October 2012 Fisheries Council, the Cyprus Presidency secured agreement on a &ldquo;partial&rdquo; general approach on the financial instrument the EMFF. Ireland will endeavour to achieve a general approach of the Council during its Presidency in the early part of 2013 with a view to securing a political agreement between the Council and EU Parliament by the end of the Irish Presidency.  All the proposals are subject to negotiation and adoption through the co-decision process involving both the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament.</p><p>  In the context of the EMFF Proposal, the EU Commission set down indicative figures for the Fund, however, funding made available will only be finalised following determination of the EU budget which is being discussed at the Leaders Summit later this month. </p><p>  The new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be structured around 4 pillars, a) Smart, Green Fisheries, b) Smart, Green Aquaculture, c) Sustainable and Inclusive Territorial Development and d) Integrated Maritime Policy. </p><p>  Of key importance to Ireland is a reasonable and fair share of the EMFF funding available.  Ireland is supportive of the proposal in relation to the provision of funding for aquaculture, seafood processing, measures that support job creation and the rebuilding and conservation of stocks.  Ireland welcomes the new elements proposed in the partial general approach including giving Member States the option of funding restructuring/decommissioning of the fishing fleet, engine replacement in limited circumstances and support for young fishermen.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s decision on the expenditure ceilings was taken in order to strike a balance between needs and priorities in all Government Departments on a multi-annual basis, to meet the requirements of the overall fiscal commitments which are firmly focused on returning the public finances to a sustainable path and to reduce the General Government Deficit by end 2015.  Budget 2013 will be framed in this framework.</p><p>  The preparations for the 2013 Estimate are currently underway and all budget lines in my Department&rsquo;s Vote are being examined critically as part of that process.

I will be taking full account of the competing priorities when compiling and allocating the funding available for 2013. </p></reply>

The Scheme encourages sustainable use of agricultural land in less favoured areas and takes account of environmental protection requirements.  The Scheme as operated by this Department defines DAS land under the following:</p><p>  -	Less Severely Handicapped Lowland and Coastal Areas with Specific Handicaps: (payable at &euro;82.27 per forage hectare);</p><p>  -	More Severely Handicapped Lowland: (payable at &euro;95.99 per forage hectare);</p><p>  -	Mountain Type Grazing: (payable at &euro;109.71 on first 10 forage hectares or part thereof and &euro;95.99 per hectare on remaining forage hectares). </p><p>  It can be seen from the above classifications and rates payable that due recognition is given to the varying degrees of disadvantage which farmers face, depending on the area of the country in which they farm.  Furthermore, the area of the country classified as disadvantaged represents approximately 75% of farmland; this designation ranges from whole counties being designated as disadvantaged, some counties being partially designated, to those counties with no designated land.  In the case of the two counties mentioned, Leitrim and Meath, the entire of County Leitrim is classified as disadvantaged (the entire county being classified as More Severely Handicapped), while a very small portion of County Meath is classified as disadvantaged (approximately 14%), the areas classified as disadvantaged being defined as Less Severely Handicapped, in the main, with a small area defined as More Severely Handicapped.</p><p>  In recognition of the physical and natural constrains occurring in areas designated as disadvantaged, farmers area required to maintain a very low minimum stocking density on their holdings; under the 2012 Scheme the requirement is to maintain a minimum stocking density per forage hectare of 0.15 livestock units for a minimum retention period of six consecutive months, in addition to which applicants must maintain an annual average of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare over the 12 months of the Scheme year.  This minimum stocking requirement equates with a stocking level of one ewe per hectare. In most areas, where the farmers are predominantly involved in livestock production, the average stocking density is well over 1.0 livestock units per hectare (lu/ha) and in many of these areas over 2.0 lu/ha.</p><p>  Furthermore, provision is made for those farmers whose adherence to recognised environmental protection plans (REPS, etc) oblige them to maintain a stocking density lower than 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare; in such cases this Department accepts the lower stocking level as meeting the requirements of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining the universal free pre-school year.  </p><p>  In the current pre-school year approximately 65,700 children are availing of the ECCE programme. This figure will increase as late entrant applications to the programme are submitted and processed. &euro;175.8 million has been provided in 2012 to cover the cost of the programme. </p><p>  I am aware of the need to further develop the early childhood care and education sector.  However, any development that involved expanding the pre-school year would require considerable additional funding.  It is estimated that an additional year's free pre-school provision would cost in the region of between &euro;124 to &euro;180 million, depending on the cohort of children supported.</p><p>  I am also very conscious that work is continuing on improvement of quality within the pre-school year and all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the provision is key to good outcomes for children.

These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the preschool year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.  However, there is no provision under the programme for a second preschool year for any child.  As the child in question has availed of the full free preschool complement in the academic year 2011/2012, there is no further entitlement under the ECCE programme.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will, of course, be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.</p></reply>

Through the framework of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, the Department of Health is working in collaboration with the relevant statutory agencies to monitor the availability of controlled drugs, including prescription medicines, through illicit channels.</p><p>  The enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse in this jurisdiction.</p><p>  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.  The Regulations also make it illegal for prescription medicines to be supplied by mail order.  The definition of mail order includes reference to electronic custom solicitation and order for supply.  This includes ordering prescription medicines through internet sites.  Furthermore, a person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a substance controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it, is guilty of an offence under that legislation.  </p><p>  My Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to introducing additional controls on certain prescription drugs being traded illicitly, for example benzodiazepine medicines.  These additional controls include introducing import and export controls as well as an offence of possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  My Department is consulting with key stakeholders in relation to the proposed amendments and it is anticipated that new legislation will be introduced by early 2013.</p></reply>

Up to &#8364;3 million of the fund will be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and a cost of &#8364;5 million has been estimated to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.  The remaining &#8364;2 million will be made available to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with <i>A Vision for Change. </i></p><p>  414 posts were approved to implement the &#8364;35 million package of special measures for mental health.  378 of the posts are with the National Recruitment Service of the HSE at various stages in the recruitment process and over 200 offers of employment have already been accepted and the appointments are proceeding.  Most start dates are expected to be in December 2012 to allow for the process of checking references etc. and costs will start to be incurred from that point.  The Government remains committed to engaging these professionals as soon as is feasible and the work of completing the process remains a priority. </p><p>  The provisional outturn for mental health services to mid-year was, like many other areas, running ahead of budget and the end of year excess in this area will be met from the unexpended portion of the &#8364;35 million.

Those having to wait &gt; 3 months (the target for 2012) have decreased from 5,062 to 1,711, a drop of 66% </p><p><b><i>Outpatients</i></b>  The initial priority for the SDU was trolley waits and daycases. It has now begun to work on improving access to outpatient services.  The SDU is now working with the NTPF to build on the current work being undertaken by the HSE and to begin the systematic collection of outpatient waiting time data at an individual patient level. The collation and analysis of OP waiting time data in this standardised format will enable the SDU and NTPF to target resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of OP services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.</p></reply>

The number of health service staff has fallen from a peak of 111,000 in 2007 to less than 103,000 now.  As we are all aware, the country still faces serious challenges in respect of the public finances, and in order to meet the targets agreed with the Troika, there will be further reductions in the level of resources allocated to the health sector.</p><p>  The 2010 Budget for the health services provided for &#8364;659m in pay savings and &#8364;400m in non-pay savings.  The <i>pay savings</i> of &#8364;659m took account of general pay reductions, and higher reductions for those on higher pay on foot of the Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration along with savings associated with the moratorium on recruitment and promotion. The <i>non-pay savings</i>   of &#8364;400m concentrated on areas which would not have a significant impact on front-line services, such as reductions in drugs costs, further economies in areas such as procurement, and improved private income collection by public hospitals.  In 2011 further price reductions were applied in relation to pharmaceuticals, to achieve full year savings of &#8364;200 million in the cost of drugs.  Further reductions in GP fees under the Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 were applied, and the charge for treating private patients in public hospitals was increased by 21%.  Along with further procurement economies, and reductions in pay as a result of the voluntary exit schemes, the objective was to mitigate as far as possible against affecting front-line services. </p><p>  Expenditure plans for 2012 were set in the context of stabilising the fiscal situation whilst protecting services to the greatest degree possible. As with other sectors, the Health sector incurred a reduction in the resources allocated to it. The gross current budget for the Health Sector for 2012 was some &#8364;183m less than the 2011 allocation. However, the underlying reduction was greater because of the need to provide for unavoidable cost increases in areas such as superannuation, demand-led schemes and Fair Deal. There was also a need to commence implementation of some priority commitments in the Programme for Government. The HSE's National Service Plan indicated that in order to meet the Government's targets and to provide for unavoidable pressures, savings of &#8364;750m will need to be achieved in 2012. </p><p>  The HSE is overspent by &#8364;374m to the end of September.  There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the excess expenditure.  In the short term, to address the 2012 position, I have instructed the Executive to impose cash limits on agency and overtime. Furthermore, there will be more rigorous management of absenteeism, travel and subsistence will be limited, and stock management will be intensified in order to better manage cash. Other measures are also being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget, including the use of capital to fund revenue and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis. </p><p>  As I have outlined in this House on previous occasions, I have instructed the HSE that efficiencies must be achieved in the first instance before patient services are affected and in this regard, patient safety must be paramount.</p></reply>

Their report was presented to me on 8 June last. On Tuesday, I announced the Government&rsquo;s decision to develop the new children&rsquo;s hospital at the campus of St James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin. In identifying the new site, the Government has carefully considered the report of the Dolphin Group along with detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.</p><p>  This decision has been made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations being of paramount importance. It is essential that the new children&rsquo;s hospital can deliver best clinical outcomes for our children. Co-location with an adult hospital has been deemed essential by the Dolphin report, and by all previous reports on this issue, while tri-location with a maternity hospital is optimal. Greenfield sites do not offer this opportunity and therefore the Dolphin report excluded greenfield sites from consideration. Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.</p><p>  I intend to move quickly now to put in place all the necessary structures and governance arrangements to enable the delivery of this project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality. This Government regards the building of the new children&rsquo;s hospital as a key priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion. </p></reply>

Historically, public nursing homes have employed a greater number of nursing staff and, therefore, had higher nursing to patient ratios than many nursing homes in the private sector. This has contributed to the higher cost of care. With regard to dependency levels, the Long-Stay Activity Statistics for 2010,   prepared by the Department of Health, indicate that at end-2010, 83.7% of residents in public nursing homes were of high and maximum dependency. In private nursing homes, 59.7% of residents were in the same category. The Deputy should be mindful that these are self-reported survey results. However, the HSE is committed to implementing a single assessment tool for older people. In addition to uniformly assess dependency levels, the introduction of such a tool would enhance quality and efficiency, promote value for money, facilitate access to long-term residential care and community services and ensure that older people are cared for in the most appropriate setting.</p><p>  The HSE is committed to examining all options to maximise the resources available for nursing home care, e.g. skill mix, rostering arrangements and reconfiguration etc. The HSE is currently finalising a review of the cost of care in public nursing homes. </p><p>Finally, the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which is expected to be completed in 2013, will examine the   overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices.</p></reply>

Similar plans are being drafted by individual countries across the EU, including in the UK.</p><p>  The HSE operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled to treatment in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland under EU Regulation 1408/71, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 574/72, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines. Within these governing EU Regulations and the Department of Health and Children's Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE).  </p><p>The TAS allows for an Irish based consultant to refer a patient that is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in another EU member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets the following criteria:</p><p>(a)	The application to refer a patient abroad has been assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.</p><p>(b)	Following clinical assessment, the referring consultant certifies the following:</p><p>	-  They recommend the patient be treated in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland;</p><p>	-  The treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient's needs;</p><p>	-  The treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment;</p><p>	-  The treatment is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner;</p><p>	-  The hospital outside the state will accept EU/EEA form E112 (IE).</p><p>All applications to the TAS are independently assessed by the HSE Health Intelligence Unit.</p></reply>

The Council (also known as CORU) was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act.</p><p>  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31 May, 2011. A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16 December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future. Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board,  the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board are currently in the process of establishment and it is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.</p><p>  All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015 or 2016 at the latest.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. e name of every registrant will be published in the register, which will be accessible on-line.  Only those registrants who have satisfied the registration board for their designated profession that they hold an approved qualification and are &quot;fit and proper&quot; to engage in the practice of the profession will be entered on the register.</p><p>  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) and will continue to do so on a reducing basis to end 2015.</p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees and in doing this it is mindful of the requirement for it to become self funding by end 2015. </p><p>  The current fee structure is as follows:</p><p>  -  A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;</p><p>  -  An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.</p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax which compares favourably with fees levied by Union and professional bodies where no tax relief is applicable.</p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income. e greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing,  for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum. Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act,  registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the bare minimum required to enable the Council to operate. The fee is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. </p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:</p><p>-   Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grand-parenting, the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grand-parenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grand-parenting. is concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;</p><p>-   The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;</p><p>-  Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system. is will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

The supports provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to people with HD involve a multi-disciplinary team approach to the provision of health and personal supports and incorporates assisted living services, including Personal Assistant Services, Aids &amp; Appliances and hospital, primary care and community services.  </p><p>  The Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland (HDAI), provides consultation, information and individualised support to those diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, their families and their health care team.  The HSE is committed to working in partnership with voluntary disability service providers, including HDAI, to ensure that all of the resources available for people with disabilities are used in the most effective manner possible.  The HSE recognises the valuable contribution of the HDAI and approved a grant of just over &euro;68,000 for 2012 to support the work of the organisation.  The HDAI is a member of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and the Disability Federation of Ireland.  Both umbrella organisations provide support to the HDAI and are supported by the State through funding from the Health Service Executive.</p><p>  I established a National Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and a patient centred approach.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the EU Council Recommendations on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  It is envisaged that the main added value of European Reference Networks and therefore of the Centres of Expertise will be to facilitate improvements in access to diagnosis and delivery of high-quality, accessible and cost-effective healthcare in the case of patients who have a medical condition requiring a particular concentration of expertise or resources, particularly in medical domains where expertise is rare. Work is ongoing on at EU level on the development of criteria, structures and governance arrangements for such networks and the Department of Health is participating in the relevant Expert Groups.</p><p>  My Department is asking the HSE to inform the Deputies in relation to the provision of services for people with Huntington&rsquo;s Disease in the Western region.</p></reply>
