    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-14a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121400066#WRA00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 41 together.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to assure the Deputies that no recipients of the CETS childcare scheme, including new entrants onto the scheme in 2016-2017, will be worse off as a result of the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  Under the current programmes, including CETS, there are many families with low income-levels who are not able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain state benefits or attending certain training programmes.</p>  <p>  In moving to the new Affordable Childcare Scheme, we will have transitional arrangements in place for current scheme beneficiaries, including CETS beneficiaries. They will enjoy a &ldquo;saver&rdquo; status for one year, or until their current training/education course ends in the case of CETS beneficiaries.  This will mean that, if they do not benefit from moving over to the new scheme they will still be able to retain their existing level of subsidy for one further year/registration period.  However, I must emphasise that the Affordable Childcare Scheme has been designed in such a way that it will make childcare more affordable and accessible for parents overall, including for 95% of those who are currently benefitting from the existing schemes.  For example, under the CETS scheme, which is the most generous of the current TEC programmes, the maximum parental contribution of &euro;25 per week equates to &euro;0.62 per hour.  By contrast, under the new scheme, those getting the maximum rate of subsidy might be expected to face a lower average parental contribution of &euro;0.30 per hour or &euro;12 per week for full-time childcare (i.e. 40 hours).  As a result, the large majority of those who would otherwise have been part of the CETS scheme are expected to see their childcare costs fall. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the base income threshold and maximum subsidy rate for future years, and the consequent impact on the affordability of childcare, will depend on decisions made in the context of the budget available for the scheme at the time.</p>  <p>  Finally, my officials recently met with representatives of SPARK in relation to the impact of the Affordable Childcare Scheme on one-parent families.  A specific concern was raised by SPARK in relation to the impact of the Affordable Childcare Scheme on recipients of the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional payment who may be required to participate in training courses as a condition of their welfare payment, but who can only afford to participate in those training courses because their childcare costs are subsidised and capped by the CETS scheme.  SPARK argue that the move to the Affordable Childcare Scheme could, if childcare fees rise, result in childcare costs becoming unaffordable for those parents, who might as a result risk losing their entitlement to the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional payment.  My officials have agreed to discuss this issue further with both the Department of Social Protection and SPARK, to ensure that the Affordable Childcare Scheme has its intended effect of making childcare more affordable and more accessible, especially for low-income families.</p>  <p>  I share both Deputies' concerns that no one should become worse off as a result of the important changes I am proposing.  I accept that it would be entirely counter-productive if a change designed to improve the affordability of childcare for some of our lowest income groups had the effect of leaving some people worse off.  I will work very closely with my officials as the exact details of the new system are worked out, to ensure that this is not the case.</p></reply>

Tusla has reiterated its position that all child protection concerns it receives are screened and assessed in line with <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of </i>Children, and that all such concerns are treated in the same way, regardless of any other challenges a child may or may not face.  Tusla has confirmed to me that no child is excluded from accessing child protection services, regardless of their situation. </p><p>Each child presenting to our State services comes with a range of differing needs and support requirements.  Children in the care of Tusla receive disability services from the HSE, where appropriate.  Where a child requires additional supports, for example, for a disability, the best possible care and service is sourced for them.</p><p>The commentary  by the HSE refers to observations on the Joint Working Protocol between the HSE and Tusla.  This document, of which disability forms just a part, was agreed upon the establishment of Tusla in January, 2014.  The comments in question relate to 2014.  Matters have moved on since then.</p><p>Since 2015, Tusla has been actively seeking to establish a new, detailed, disability protocol with the HSE governing children in care and aftercare, and access to disability services.  This protocol would also specify how Tusla might be of assistance to HSE cases in relation to supports under Tusla&rsquo;s remit.</p><p>I am pleased that, in the last few days, Tusla and the HSE have agreed a new protocol in principle, which will operate to ensure good collaboration between Tusla and the HSE on disability-related services for children.  The exact wording is being finalised but, cooperation will be immediate.  In addition, officials from both my Department and the Department of Health will meet soon to further develop and copper fasten the appropriate oversight of this new working arrangement.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that there is a clear escalation process that can be used by Tusla or the HSE should an issue arise, or if there is an unresolved matter regarding access to appropriate, available services.</p></reply>

As the Deputy mentions my Department projects that the expanded ECCE scheme will have a peak enrolment of 127,000 children in the April-June session in 2017. This is an increase of 60,000 children from the pre-expansion volume. </p>  <p>  In anticipation of the increased demand for places in the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme for 2016/17, we introduced a number of measures to assist Early Years providers and ensure sufficient capacity.  For example, I provided capital funding of &euro;4m to services throughout the country to increase capacity, a fund that was later increased to &euro;6.5m, allowing all applications that met the criteria for grant funding to be approved.  This capital scheme has already provided several thousand new places, and this number will increase as works are completed.  A further &euro;4.5 million has been made in Budget 2017 for Capital expenditure and I will bring formal proposals in this regard as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  We have encouraged ECCE Room Leaders to improve their qualifications via targeted Learner Funds, while also widening access to Higher Capitation payments for the 2016/17 preschool year.  </p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with Childcare Committees Ireland (CCI) to analyse demand for places on a geographic basis, to identify any shortages in provision, and to work intensively with services in areas where shortfalls might have been expected to occur.  CCI has indicated to my Department that sufficient places should exist for the January intake and CCI is now analysing the April capacity.  My Department will continue to actively monitor and manage the situation to ensure sufficient capacity is available in 2017.</p></reply>

The new scheme will provide for both universal and targeted subsidies towards the cost of childcare.  It will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  I want it to provide &ldquo;wraparound‟ care for pre-school and school-age children.</p>  <p>  To ensure good governance, the Affordable Childcare Scheme will be put on a statutory basis.  The necessary primary legislation will encompass:</p>  <p> -  clear and detailed rules for the assessment of income and the provision of subsidies</p>  <p> -  clearly prescribed authority in relation to the sharing of data across public bodies and administrators</p>  <p> -  comprehensive provisions in relation to the powers and obligations of the scheme administrator and</p>  <p> -  high-level requirements and associated powers of sanction in relation to scheme participation by childcare providers</p>  <p>  The primary legislation will take account of all necessary amendments to existing legislation.  As part of this, the use of the PPS number and data sharing across public bodies and agencies will be supported through legislation and formal data sharing agreements.  Officials in my Department are currently drafting Heads of Bill for the scheme, which are at an advanced stage.  I intend to bring the Heads of Bill to Government for approval early in the New Year.  Thereafter, the precise timeframe for the drafting of the legislation and its passage through the Houses will be subject to the usual considerations regarding scheduling and allocation of parliamentary time.  My objective is that legislation will be in place in early summer, and I look forward to piloting this important scheme through both Houses.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-14a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121400066#WRA02400"><p>As the Deputy is aware, there was a recent D&aacute;il motion in respect of unaccompanied children who were previously living in the unofficial camps near Calais and work is ongoing.  I am co-ordinating my efforts with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is in a position to play its part when the children begin to arrive here.  I understand that there have been a number of contacts with the French authorities and that they have welcomed our offer of solidarity.  I have had productive consultations with Tusla and I am happy with the progress that we are making.  My officials have also recently met with volunteers who had worked with children in the unofficial camp in Calais.  The volunteers are aware of the steps needed to implement the D&aacute;il motion.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that we have the services in place to receive these children from France and the existing service will need to be expanded to achieve this.  Tusla has outlined the necessary steps to increase its capacity to receive unaccompanied minors, and the resources they will need, with the intention of ensuring that the equity of care principle is observed.  As it will take time to put all the elements needed in place, it can be expected that the relocation of unaccompanied minors will be on an incremental basis.  On my recent visit to Greece, the range of needs of refugee children, especially those without their parents, was apparent and it is important that we are in a position to meet the needs of this very vulnerable cohort and that our efforts are a success. </p></reply>

Children under 16 who present as out of home to emergency services without a parent or guardian are taken into care. Children aged 16 and 17 similarly presenting may be taken into care, or provided with a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 (accommodation for homeless children).  For young people who were formerly in the care of the State, aftercare services are also put in place in respect of the specific needs of a child, including accommodation and educational supports.</p><p>Children who are homeless as part of a family group remain in the care of their parent/s.  Where there are no welfare or protection concerns Tusla&rsquo;s role is to provide family support.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department, as part of a whole-Government approach to homelessness is committed to helping families by supporting implementation of <i>Rebuilding Ireland: the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.</p><p>The overarching aim of the Action Plan is to ramp up delivery of housing across all tenures in order to help individuals and families, with a particular focus on  those in emergency accommodation, to meet their housing needs.  It is explicitly acknowledged in the Action Plan that any medium to long-term period living in a hotel seriously impacts on normal family life and is particularly detrimental to children.  My Department is committed to doing everything it can to minimise this impact by supporting families and children as much as possible while they are in emergency accommodation.</p><p>My Department is working to provide such additional supports by funding research to identify issues regarding access to food and potential nutritional impacts, and by enhancing access to early years services for homeless families.  It is planned to launch this scheme next January. </p><p>Also, I recently secured the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that the provision of accommodation for young people leaving State care would be eligible for funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) operated by his Department.  My Department and Tusla will work to ensure that any accommodation proposed, and ultimately delivered, will be provided with the appropriate levels of protective factors for the young person making the transition to independent living.</p><p>Many of the remaining child-focussed actions in the Action Plan are being advanced by Tusla.  This year, Tusla provided funding to Focus Ireland for additional child support workers to assist with the challenges facing families in emergency accommodation.  Furthermore, the joint protocol between Tusla and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive governing child welfare and protection matters is fully operational and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State.</p></reply>

The report in respect of monitoring against national standards was published in November 2016.  </p>  <p>  The inspection report identified a worrying level of high risk behaviours by some young people, which staff were not able to manage, and which impacted on other young people in the centre.  Tusla accepted the findings of the report and informed the Minister that these behaviours stopped by May 2016 and that the number of significant notifications had decreased significantly before the inspection took place in August.  However, this does not detract from the risk to safety identified in the report. An action plan was prepared by Tusla to address improvements that were needed and were published with the report. Tusla has updated its child protection policy and training is being provided.  Professional supervision training, a deficit highlighted in the report, is important for improving safety and this is being provided for all staff and management. </p>  <p>  The inspection report showed that the children received good education, their health was well looked after and there was a good range of age appropriate activities.  All of the children had an allocated social worker.</p>  <p>  I have expressed my deep concern about this report to Mr Fred McBride, CEO of Tusla and requested assurances that the children are safe and doing well.  I have also sought action on the institutional aspects of care highlighted in the report and have directed that I be kept up to date on progress of improvements to the service on a regular basis. </p></reply>

Tusla has reiterated its position that all child protection concerns it receives are screened and assessed in line with <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of </i>Children, and that all such concerns are treated in the same way, regardless of any other challenges a child may or may not face.  Tusla has confirmed to me that no child is excluded from accessing child protection services, regardless of their situation. </p><p>Each child presenting to our State services comes with a range of differing needs and support requirements.  Children in the care of Tusla receive disability services from the HSE, where appropriate.  Where a child requires additional supports, for example, for a disability, the best possible care and service is sourced for them.</p><p>The commentary in question released by the HSE refers to observations on the Joint Working Protocol between the HSE and Tusla.  This document, of which disability forms just a part, was agreed upon the establishment of Tusla in January, 2014.  The comments in question relate to 2014.  Matters have moved on since then.</p><p>Since 2015, Tusla has been actively seeking to establish a new, detailed, disability protocol with the HSE governing children in care and aftercare, and access to disability services.  This protocol would also specify how Tusla might be of assistance to HSE cases in relation to supports under Tusla&rsquo;s remit.</p><p>I am pleased that, in the last few days, Tusla and the HSE have agreed a new protocol in principle, which will operate to ensure good collaboration between Tusla and the HSE on disability-related services for children.  The exact wording is being finalised but, co-operation will be immediate.  In addition, officials from both my Department and the Department of Health will meet soon to further develop and copper fasten the appropriate oversight of this new working arrangement.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that there is a clear escalation process that can be used by Tusla or the HSE should an issue arise, or if there is an unresolved matter regarding access to appropriate, available services.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  The voluntary youth sector involves approximately 1,400 paid staff, including youth workers and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to tell the Deputy that Budget 2016 has provided an additional &euro;5.5m in current funding to my Department for voluntary youth services.  The increased funding will support, in the main, the targeted programmes for young people who are at risk of drugs or alcohol misuse, homelessness, unemployment or early school leaving.  It will allow,  potentially, an increase of up to 5% to all existing youth projects; the inclusion of organisations providing much needed services to young people and which haven&rsquo;t been funded up to now and the re-examination of current funding streams to ensure best outcomes for young people.</p>  <p>  Following the Budget 2017 announcement, my Department commenced the process with local services, via the Education and Training Boards and national organisations to identify service development needs for 2017 and to agree the 2017 allocations.  Every effort will be made to complete this process as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  You will be aware that the targeted schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  The work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes over the coming years.   </p>  <p>  As a first step, my Department has embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board Youth Officer, which will map youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist my Department and the relevant Education and Training Board in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels, particularly when the Census 2016 data becomes available.  It is my intention that this mapping exercise will inform future development and investment in youth services.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have had the pleasure of visiting many youth services across the country since my appointment.  I have seen, first hand, the enormous contribution that these services make to improving outcomes for young people and I can assure the Deputy of my continued support for the sector, over the coming years. </p></reply>

I am fully committed to working with my colleagues in Government, particularly Minister Varadkar, in ensuring a collaborative approach to tackle child poverty.  In June, Minister Varadkar and I both addressed a conference on child poverty organised by the Children's Rights Alliance. Both Minister Varadkar and I agree on the need for a whole of government response to child poverty.</p><p>The Government set a child-specific poverty target in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two-thirds by 2020.  This figure currently represents 97,000 children.  I chair the Policy Consortium that leads the work of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>to drive key actions, including those on child poverty.</p><p>To progress this priority, the Department of Social Protection are working with my Department and others on developing an implementation plan for reaching the child poverty target in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  </i>This reflects the active work across government in developing a multi dimensional approach comprising key issues in this area, such as social transfers and income supports (DSP), childcare, family support and prevention and early intervention (DCYA), DEIS (DES) and health (DH).  This should be finalised in time to go to the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>Consortium for approval in February 2017.</p><p>This plan was informed by officials from other departments, as well as from members of the Advisory Council for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, which brings together key community and voluntary sector organisations, as well as independent experts with experience working with and for children and young people.</p><p>My Department, in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection, held an EU Peer Review in February 2016 with 10 EU countries to explore innovative responses in prevention and early intervention to improve outcomes for children - in particular those experiencing child poverty and disadvantage.  The learning from this peer review is informing our efforts in embedding prevention and early intervention in services for children and young people in Ireland as part of a multi dimensional approach to addressing child poverty. </p></reply>

We have a number of commitments in the Programme for Government relating to enabling access to high quality and affordable childcare.  I am determined to deliver on these commitments. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) in September 2017 will provide more accessible and more affordable childcare both on a universal and a targeted basis, to families.  This will represent a major milestone in childcare in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Since September 2016, the extension of ECCE had made free pre-school available, for 15 hours per week, to all children from the time they turn three, until they go to school.  Children can enter at three points in the year.  On average, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the current provision of 38 weeks.  Access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE can reduce the cost of childcare by &euro;4,000 per child.  The current ECCE programme is accommodating 67,000 children and this figure will increase to 127,000 next year.</p>  <p>  My Department extended the terms of the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme in March 2016 so that it could be provided by private childcare providers across the country as well as community/not-for-profit providers.  This was to ensure that eligible families, regardless of where they live, can access this important childcare subvention.  The full rate of CCS reduces childcare costs by &euro;95 per week, and is available to parents in receipt of social welfare payments including the One Parent Family Payment or Family Income Supplement.  This Scheme will continue in existence until the new Scheme is introduced in September 2017.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing childcare.  This review will be overseen by my Department and will include analysis of the potential benefits and risks of imposing price caps on childcare providers.  The results will be considered in the context of the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p></reply>

Children living in direct provision are not in the care of Tusla. Concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in direct provision are referred to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in line with Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  Tusla has been working closely with the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality, which has responsibility for direct provision. </p>  <p>  The needs of children in direct provision relate to education, preschool, development and health and where needed, they will be referred to relevant services.  Tusla provides services that offer advice and support to families in their parenting role.  This includes family support workers, social workers, youth workers, family resource centres, support groups and counselling services. </p>  <p>  The Child and Family Services Unit within RIA has a post for a seconded member of Tusla, and links are made to the HSE, GPs, Tusla and voluntary and community groups as necessary.  The role of this Unit is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan matters relating to the health and welfare of children and families living in the direct provision system.</p>  <p>  Children are protected in a number of ways in the direct provision system - primarily through RIA&rsquo;s child protection policy. Referrals include welfare concerns for a child when a parent is hospitalised and there is no family member to care for the child, ongoing parental illness, or parental mental health problems, while a smaller number relate to child protection concerns.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality established a working group to review a range of issues pertaining to asylum seekers and direct provision; the Report of the Working Group on the Protection Process was published in June 2015.  The report identified that direct provision, while satisfactory as a support to families in the short term, was not an environment conducive to family life over the longer term.  Tusla has been engaging with the HSE and RIA on progressing the recommendations from this report.  Also the enactment of the International Protection Act, 2015 greatly simplifies the process for those entering direct provision, and aims to reduce the time spent there significantly. </p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000.  </p><p>The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020, published last October, sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years.  The Strategy identifies some fifty priority actions to be delivered by Government departments, state agencies and by others, including the voluntary youth services over 2015 to 2017. </p><p>To achieve this aim, a number of objectives have been set in relation to each of the five national outcome areas. One of these is that &ldquo;Young people are a particular focus in policies that address social inclusion and poverty&rdquo;.</p><p>The Government set a child-specific poverty target in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two-thirds by 2020.  I chair the Policy Consortium that leads the work of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>to drive key actions, including those on child poverty.  The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty, and is the Sponsor Department for outcome four in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures:  </i>that all children and young people should be enjoying economic security and opportunity.  It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed under <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>.  To progress this priority, I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection that his Department are working on developing an implementation plan for reaching the child poverty target in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures. </i>This should be finalised in time to go to the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures  </i>Consortium for approval in February 2017.</p><p>This plan was informed by officials from a number of departments, as well as from members of the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>, which brings together key community and voluntary sector organisations, as well as independent experts with experience working with and for children and young people. </p><p>I am also advised by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, that the national social target for poverty reduction, which sets out the Government&rsquo;s ambition for reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty, is to reduce consistent poverty to 2% or less by 2020, from the baseline rate of 6.3% in 2010.  Since 1997 Ireland has developed national anti-poverty strategies to provide a strategic framework in which to tackle poverty and social exclusion.  The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 was recently updated and extended to 2017. </p></reply>

My Department has policy responsibility for children under 18 who present as &lsquo;out of home&rsquo; without their parent(s) or guardian(s) and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991 . Children under 16 who present as out of home to emergency services are taken into care.

Where there are no welfare or protection concerns, Tusla&rsquo;s role is to provide family support.  A joint protocol between Tusla and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) governing child welfare and protection matters is fully operational and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State.</p><p>Furthermore, it is worth noting that in<i>Rebuilding Ireland: the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness,</i>the Government has committed to ensuring that by mid-2017, hotels are only used in limited circumstances for emergency accommodation for families. </p><p>My Department, together with Tusla, is working to provide additional supports for families in emergency accommodation to mitigate the challenges faced by parents and children in this situation.  My Department is funding research to identify issues regarding access to food and potential nutritional impacts on families in emergency homeless accommodation.

These young people are a vulnerable cohort and the State is duty bound by international and domestic law to protect and provide care.

The key principle of the Children Act 2001 is that detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort.  When children come into contact with the criminal justice system there is an emphasis on the promotion of community based options in the first instance.  The Irish Youth Justice Service oversees a significant investment in community based programmes to divert young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, approximately &euro;17m has been allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to the Irish Youth Justice Service for services relating to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus and the Bail Supervision Scheme which has recently been established</p>  <p>  It is intended that the Bail Supervision Scheme will provide more therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  The service will provide a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.  It is envisioned that such a scheme will offer greater options to the courts in the knowledge that closer monitoring will take place through interaction with the young people, their families and communities. </p>  <p>  If a child is remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in the children detention schools, a range of rehabilitative supports is offered to every child as part of an overall programme, which focuses on the child&rsquo;s individual needs and provides the framework for each child&rsquo;s individual journey through detention.  The focus is on developing supportive relationships with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation.  Each child is the subject of an individual screening to determine any clinical services required, such as psychology, psychiatry or speech and language therapy.  A placement plan is developed and reviewed at regular intervals during each child&rsquo;s stay in detention.  The strong ethos of school attendance, education and training, in place in Oberstown, is tailored to each child's individual needs.  Education and training services are provided by the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  </p>  <p>  The wide range of rehabilitation, education and support services provided and supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service are detailed in the Tackling Youth Crime: Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018, and a progress report covering the period 2014 to 2015, published this week can be found on my Departments website. </p>  <p>  The Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme (FRC programme), which is operated by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provides supports to 109 communities.  Tusla has provided core funding of approximately &euro;13m this year to its established network of 107 Centres nationwide, and two outreach Centres.  The primary role of the FRC programme is prevention and early intervention through family support, by providing guidance and parenting supports, and is a key programme in reducing offending behaviour among children at risk.  The Centres emphasise the involvement of local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Educational Welfare Services of Tusla operating under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, work together collaboratively and cohesively with schools and other relevant services to promote school attendance and secure better educational outcomes for children and young people.</p></reply>

The Strategy sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to, work are supported and enabled to do so.  It is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p>The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work</p><p>- Make work pay</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support</p><p>- Engage employers.</p><p>Given the complex cross-government nature of the strategy, an oversight implementation group was established under the independent chairmanship of Fergus Finlay.  This group is tasked with monitoring the progress of the six strategic priorities of the strategy, ensuring that each Government Department is fulfilling its obligations and meeting its targets.  It will shortly be publishing its first annual report, which will highlight areas where sufficient progress has not been made, and will also include recommendations in relation to priorities for 2017.</p><p>While I cannot comment on individual circumstances, I can confirm that the Strategy includes a range of practical measures to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities.  For example, a national employer help-line was launched in January of this year to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers in relation to the employment of staff with disabilities.  Furthermore, there will be an increase in the pubic sector employment quota from 3% to 6% on a phased basis to 2024, and work will begin on this in the new year.

The Deputy will appreciate that the specific investigative strategies which may be deployed in relation to such crimes are a matter for the Garda authorities in the first instance.  It is of course essential that anyone with information in relation to racist and other hate crimes provides full details to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  GRIDO monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis. Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) are appointed to work with minority communities at local level throughout the country.  These officers combined with GRIDO play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities in the pursuit of preventing the commission of hate and racist crime. GRIDO and ELOs provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime where required or deemed necessary. </p>  <p>  In addition to the work of the Garda&iacute;, the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, an Office of my Department, is the focal point for the Government's commitment on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy.  The Office continues to work with all the relevant sectors to further progress the integration and diversity management agenda. </p>  <p>  A review of our approach to the integration of migrants has almost neared completion.  This review will provide the basis for a new and updated migrant integration strategy.  Work on the Integration Strategy is very advanced and is expected to be published  early in the New Year.

With respect to incitement to hatred, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 makes it an offence to use words, publish or distribute written material or broadcast any visual images or sounds which are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred.  The word "hatred" is defined as "hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation.". </p>  <p>  Separately, where a criminal offence such as assault, criminal damage or a public order offence is committed against a person based on their race, religion, colour, ethnicity or some other ground, the offence is prosecuted through the wider criminal law.

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to actually protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 December.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial. </p>  <p>  Work is under way on drawing up the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  The Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty.  The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department of Justice and Equality website.  The Bill is at the final stages of drafting and I expect the Bill to be published very shortly so as to facilitate ratification of the Convention as early as possible.</p></reply>

This was replaced later with the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) which allows for Syrians and other nationalities to benefit from resettlement and relocation schemes, and offers them protection in Ireland in their own right.  This is a much improved programme allowing thousands to benefit from protection here. Under the IRPP, the Red Cross has investigated a number of pledges of public support and these are appreciated.  There has been a significant challenge at EU level to maximise the functioning of the resettlement and relocation programmes.  We will be 100% ahead of target on resettlement when the programme ends next September and following my recent visit to Greece, I am satisfied that the number coming in under relocation will ramp up to agreed levels in 2017.  I am not of the view that the best solution to this crisis is to increase the number of programmes and all the administrative and legal complexities that go with them.  My emphasis is to increase the number of people arriving in Ireland under the programmes currently in place.  I am satisfied that we are making that progress now and that there is still capacity to ensure more Syrians can come to Ireland under our resettlement and relocation programmes and all our focus needs to be on meeting these targets.  I would encourage all community groups and individuals to continue to make contact with offers of support to the Red Cross and the Irish Refugee Protection Programme - these will be followed up and assessed promptly and can directly benefit the increased numbers of people we have committed to welcoming to Ireland next year. </p>  <p>  Significant resources are currently being invested in these humanitarian efforts through the offices of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, the Office of the Promotion of Migrant Integration and the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  As a result we have developed mechanisms and associated expertise to deal with resettlement and relocation.  Our response to the migrant crisis in terms of accepting refugees is through the IRPP and all available resources are being directed to that Programme in order to meet the commitment entered into and I have no plans, at this point, to introduce any additional  admission programmes.</p></reply>

The Policy Document, which is available on the INIS website <i>www.inis.gov.ie,</i>provides a comprehensive statement of national immigration policy on the area of family reunification.  The policies outlined in the document apply to all decision making in relation to family reunification cases where Ministerial discretion applies, including long stay (join family) visa applications.  Statistics are not available on cases whereby discretion was exercised.</p><p>With regard to naturalisation applications, the granting of an application for citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  The Act provides that the Minister for Justice and Equality has absolute discretion to grant an application if satisfied that the applicant fulfils the prescribed conditions.  These statutory conditions include that the applicant must be of full age; be of good character; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.  </p><p>Section 16 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in his or her absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances, i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.  A person is of Irish associations if he or she is related by blood, affinity or adoption to a person who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen.  </p><p>Each application for a certificate of naturalisation is examined on its own merits and the Minister decides, at her discretion, whether to grant or refuse the application based on all the information provided.  Records are not maintained in such a way as to provide statistics on the number of instances in which the Minister's discretion, as provided for under the Act, was exercised. </p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Lebanon.  A full breakdown of Ireland's commitments under the programme is attached in Table A below. </p><p>Under the resettlement part of the Programme, 519 persons out of the original quota of 520 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict have arrived in Ireland to date.  This is a full year ahead of the EU Commission deadline for this programme.In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017.  Sufficient refugees to fill 260 places on this quota have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and these refugees are expected to arrive in Spring 2017.  A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in coming months to select the balance of the 2017 quota.</p><p>Under relocation, Ireland has to date taken in 109 asylum seekers from Greece, mostly families, and a further 130 people are scheduled to arrive later this week.  A further 84 people have been assessed and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made.  This week, IRPP officials are interviewing a group of approximately 80 people in Athens who, subject to Garda security assessments, are expected to be cleared for arrival by the end of the year.  In all this means that over 400 persons, mostly families with young children, will have either arrived in Ireland or been cleared for arrival by the end of 2016.  The intention is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments within the timeframe envisaged by the Programme.  A summary of arrivals to date is attached in Table B below. </p><p>In announcing the Programme, the Government recognised the importance of addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  The relocation of unaccompanied minors is a complex and sensitive process, involving various aspects of European and domestic law, and any actions taken in relation to this vulnerable group must always have the principle of the best interests of the child and the prospect of family reunification at their centre.  Ireland is committed to relocating unaccompanied minors and this has been clearly demonstrated by the recent Government decision to offer to relocate up to 200 unaccompanied minors, formerly resident in the migrant camp at Calais, to Ireland.  As regards the relocation of unaccompanied minors from Greece, the situation is complicated somewhat by the variety of different definitions used across EU States and voluntary organisations of just what legally constitutes an unaccompanied minor.  There is no legally binding definition across the EU.  So for consistency's sake I will use the definition used by Greek officials which is what the EU Commission uses in its statistics.  Under this definition, which essentially says an unaccompanied minor is anyone under 18 who is not accompanied by an adult member of the immediate  family, Ireland has thus far taken in 5 unaccompanied minors from Greece.  A further 7 will be included in the group of 130 arriving this week.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the T&aacute;naiste and her colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs returned yesterday from Greece where they met with officials and volunteer groups and visited migrant camps to see first hand the challenges being faced and to reaffirm Ireland's support for Greece in its efforts to manage this ongoing humanitarian crisis.  Officials from Tusla also take part in any mission to Athens where the group being assessed contains unaccompanied minors requiring their care upon arrival.</p><p><b>Table A - Commitments made by the Government under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme</b><table><tr><th>Relocation</th><th>Italy</th><th>Greece</th><th>Unallocated*</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1523</td><td>360</td><td>240</td><td>0</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1601</td><td>263</td><td>849</td><td>910</td><td>2,022</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>623</td><td>1089</td><td>910</td><td>2,622</td></tr></table></p><p>*Awaiting further implementing Council Decision <table><tr><th>Resettlement</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 09/06/15</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 06/07/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 29/11/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>1,040</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Summary</th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td>Total Relocation </td><td><div>2,622</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total Resettlement</td><td><div>1,040</div></td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 10/11/16 Re: UAM&rsquo;s previously in Calais</td><td><div>200</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mechanism Undecided</td><td><div>138</div></td></tr><tr><td>GRAND TOTAL</td><td><div>4,000</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Table B - Arrivals to Date<table><tr><th>IRPP Programme</th><th>Numbers admitted (as of 12 Dec 2016)</th><th>Unaccompanied Minors admitted (as of 12 Dec 2016)</th></tr><tr><td>Resettlement</td><td>519</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Relocation</td><td>109</td><td>5</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. While it is the case, as advised by the Commissioner, that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of dedicated Community Garda&iacute; throughout the state.  We are now rebuilding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Kildare Division, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the move to full individualisation of the income tax system was never completed.</p>  <p>  The 2009 Commission on Taxation examined the tax band structure and income tax credits which apply to married one-earner and married two-earner couples and recommended that they should remain in place.  The Home Carer Credit forms part of the current "hybrid" structure relating to band individualisation, and the Commission concluded that it would not be realistic to contemplate its withdrawal where the current arrangements in relation to the tax bands continue to exist or in circumstances where band individualisation is completed.  Furthermore, the Commission considered that, as a general principle and subject to resource constraints, the value of the credit should be increased generally in line with the value of other personal tax credits.</p>  <p>  While the value of other personal tax credits has generally remained constant since 2011, I have increased the value of the Home Carer Credit in both Budgets 2016 and 2017, and it will now stand at &euro;1,100 per annum with effect from January 2017.  The Budget 2017 increase follows a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to support parents who choose to stay at home and care for their children through an increase in the Home Carers Credit.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that Revenue has, for a number of years, taken steps to automatically allow the Home Carer Credit without the person having to make a claim, wherever possible.  For example, Revenue uses data it receives from the Department of Social Protection in relation to child benefit, together with other data from Revenue's own records, to automatically grant the credit.  Revenue also pre-populates the annual tax returns of self-assessed taxpayers with the Home Carer Credit where it was claimed in the previous year.  In 2014, the most recent year for which full information is available, the Home Carer Credit was claimed by approximately 80,900 families, at an exchequer cost of &euro;60.9 million.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-14a.154.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121400067#WRB08400"><p>I would first note, as I have previously, that since the establishment of the Revenue Commissioners in 1923, successive Governments and the Oireachtas have reaffirmed the principle of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in their dealings with the tax affairs of any individual under tax and customs legislation.  This independence is seen as critical to maintaining the integrity of the taxation system and forms a key pillar of Revenue's Governance framework. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Capital Gains Tax exemption introduced in Finance Act 2014, referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied with this Question, this was a policy measure introduced in response to a change in the EU Common Agriculture Policy (CAP).  The technical change to the CAP impacted on those farmers who leased 100% of their land and farm payment entitlements, and resulted in those farmers being obliged either to sell their farm payment entitlements or lose them under the new CAP.  Affected farmers were advised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to transfer their farm payment entitlements to active farmers in advance of the CAP changes taking effect, and in these circumstances I considered it appropriate to provide an exemption from CGT on any chargeable gains arising from such a disposal. </p>  <p>  By contrast, Revenue's position with regard to the taxation of Kerry Co-op patronage shares is based on long-standing principles of taxation contained in current tax legislation.  The issue of patronage shares held in Kerry Co-op and their tax treatment was considered at a recent Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach held on Wednesday 7 December at which representatives from Revenue were in attendance to answer questions about the matter.  On the tax technical issue itself as regard the patronage shares in question and liability to income tax, I am aware that Revenue explained its view that the true market value of the shares received at par is correctly assessable as a trading receipt of the supplier's farming business and is therefore assessable to income tax.  The shares essentially represent a form of payment received for the milk supplied and therefore the value of the shares forms part of the farmer's trading income for the relevant years.</p>  <p>  Arising from this meeting Revenue undertook to allow the persons affected by this issue additional time to engage with them on this matter.  In that regard, I am advised that Revenue will shortly send a letter to each farmer concerned clarifying some matters that have arisen from their original letter to farmers and also explaining how Revenue proposes to bring this matter forward from here.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that Revenue has been asked to facilitate a test case before the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) to determine the tax technical issue.  The TAC is an entirely independent statutory body with sole responsibility for accepting or refusing appeals and deciding how it will process appeals where common or related issues arise.  I am advised that Revenue will, however, facilitate such a process and will address this matter in its further letter to the farmers concerned.</p></reply>

This practice is known as &ldquo;rolled-up holiday pay&rdquo; and derives from a collective agreement on the appropriate rate of pay for part-time teachers reached at the Teachers Conciliation Council in 2003.  Circular 0015/2015 ceased the practice of paying &ldquo;rolled-up holiday pay&rdquo; to casual and non-casual teachers and introduced a separate payment in respect of holiday pay.  This change was necessary to bring the method of remunerating such teachers into line with the European Union Working Time Directive, following a decision of the European Commission.  It is important to note that the overall remuneration of such teachers was not changed as a result of the Circular.</p>  <p>  I have confirmed that teachers comprehended by Circular 0015/2015 who are paid on payrolls operated by my Department were paid holiday pay on 1 December at primary level and on 8 December at post-primary level.</p>  <p>  As Education and Training Boards operate their own payrolls in respect of staff employed by the ETB, the Deputy should contact Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB for further information in respect of his query.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  NEPS provides a valuable service to the school community and one which I view as a priority.  The service has, over the course of recent economic difficulties, not only maintained psychologist staffing levels within NEPS, but has increased them by some 10% since late 2008, to 162 whole time equivalent psychologists currently employed.</p>  <p>  Additionally the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the further expansion in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents.  The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173.</p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists are recruited via regional panels formed from national recruitment competitions administered by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The panel which had existed in this regard had reached the end of its useful life and proved unable to answer the recruitment needs from the viewpoint of ongoing staffing losses due to resignation or retirement or to bring the NEPS staffing complement up to its current limit of 173 w.t.e.  It has now been closed.</p>  <p>  A new national recruitment competition has been put in place by PAS to fill vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The closing date for applications is now passed and work is currently ongoing in relation to the examination of applications and short-listing of candidates for interview.  It is envisaged following interviews that recruitment panels will be formed and active filling of vacancies will commence in the new-year and to provide for expanded staffing provision countenanced in the Programme for Government as resources allow.</p></reply>

These included pay reductions since 2010 and also reductions to the pay of new entrant public servants (including teachers) since 2011.  Collective agreements reached between the Government and the public service unions provided vital industrial peace during this very difficult period for the State.</p>  <p>  Equality and fairness are at the heart of everything this Government is trying to do, particularly in the area of education where I am especially focused on creating better opportunities for people from disadvantaged areas in our education system. Indeed, the recent Budget secured funding to deliver on a wide range of measures to support this objective. </p>  <p>  The Haddington Road/Lansdowne Road Agreement has allowed a programme of restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  </p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. </p>  <p>  The pay increases for new teachers can also be available to ASTI members under the proposals which resulted from recent discussions.  The ASTI Central Executive Committee took a decision to put the outcome of the recent talks process to a ballot of members with a recommendation to reject.  The ASTI&rsquo;s leadership have taken a view on the proposals.  It is now over to the members to form their view.  </p>  <p>  There are immediate undoubted benefits for individual ASTI members in accepting the proposals, including these pay increases for new teachers.  They will have to weigh those up for themselves.  Those benefits are only available to ASTI members if they vote to accept. The choice for ASTI members to consider is whether to accept the immediate benefits on offer and participate with the other unions in a further process of engagement or forego those immediate benefits in favour of further industrial action.  It is for the ASTI leadership to explain its strategy in respect of the latter approach.</p></reply>

Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning.  Therefore my Department, in consultation with the representative school management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support school leaders and how their needs might be addressed. </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided 250 posts to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be freed up from teaching time and be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school and was effective from the start of the 2016/17 school year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts to lift the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts in both the primary and post-primary sector.  A Department circular will issue in early January in relation to these new arrangements.</p></reply>

However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes.  The specified purposes being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.

The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates.  The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above).</p>  <p>  The information requested in respect of the percentage refund of commercial rates applied by each local authority to property unoccupied for specified purposes is not available in my Department.</p></reply>

The objective of the review was to ensure that practical and appropriate fire safety measures, which contribute to preventing loss of life and serious injury in local authority Traveller accommodation, have been applied systematically across the country. Along with appraising fire safety against relevant standards, this included running a series of community fire safety initiatives, including fire safety awareness training, aimed at Traveller Organisations and persons interfacing with the Traveller community so that awareness of fire risk and fire safety is developed and maintained over the longer term.</p><p>Consultation with all stakeholders at both national and local level was seen as essential to generate confidence in the review process.  Accordingly, from the outset, the NDFEM engaged with key stakeholders at national level. A representative National Steering Group (NSG) was established by the NDFEM to oversee the review process and to offer support in addressing identified issues.  The NSG was made up of relevant stakeholders including Traveller community representatives, national level and local government representatives and independent monitors.</p><p>The NDFEM wrote to Local Authority Chief Executives on 3 December 2015 requesting that they proceed to undertake the review in accordance with the approach outlined in a suite of support documentation.  The Project Initiation Document envisaged that there would be local engagement with Traveller Community representatives in each local authority area to assist in undertaking the review and implementing Community Fire Safety, mirroring the National Steering Group role; this was the process agreed to enable Traveller organisations in individual local authority areas to input to the review.  It was suggested that this could be achieved either through adding fire safety to the role of an existing Consultative Committee or by convening an ad-hoc group with appropriate membership for the purpose of this Review.</p><p>The Programme to Review Fire Safety in Local Authority Traveller Accommodation has concluded.  Local Authorities submitted reports to the NDFEM detailing the work that was undertaken as part of the review.  This information was collated by the NDFEM resulting in the generation of the <i>Report on the Programme to Review and Enhance Fire Safety in Local Authority Provided Traveller Accommodation</i>, published on 21 September 2016. A copy of the report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:  <i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i></p><p>.</p><p>This report describes fire safety work which has taken place in Local Authority provided Traveller accommodation across the country up to 1 July 2016. In addition to the physical works, the report describes a parallel programme of community fire safety which has been undertaken incorporating training for key workers and engagement with community groups on fire safety awareness. </p><p>Information regarding the fire safety appraisals and the remedial work undertaken as part of the review, as well as information regarding any further fire safety enhancements carried out since 1 July 2016 and the fire and safety training that has taken place in Traveller accommodation units or with Traveller organisations, can be obtained directly from the relevant local authorities; in this case, Galway County Council and Galway City Council. </p></reply>

Pending statutory regulation of the sector, in order to be eligible for funding for future projects and schemes, CENA will be subject to the new Financial and Assessment Framework which will come into effect from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  Regarding the pilot project in Galway, as part of Phase 1 of the Traveller Accommodation Plan (2014-2018), Galway City Council put forward proposals to develop a traveller specific halting site in the Ballybane area of the city.  The report on the Phase 1 plans has now been considered by the Elected Members of the Council, following detailed discussions with area Councillors, Residents Associations and Traveller families in the community.  A further assessment of the site, along with consultations with CENA, will now take place to allow this pilot project to move forward. </p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, enforcement of RTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  Given the demand for enforcement, it is not sustainable for the RTB to initiate proceedings on all requests.  As the Board was established to take cases out of the Courts, it endeavours to secure enforcement initially by non-judicial means. </p>  <p>  While there is no legal obligation on the RTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously.  In 2015 alone, it referred 312 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order.  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment, of an award.  In many cases the best option - and one which the RTB facilitates - is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.</p>  <p>  Section 124 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides for the enforcement of RTB determination orders in the Circuit Court. Section 57 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 amends section 124 to provide for the enforcement of RTB determination orders through the District Court rather than the Circuit Court.  This will considerably reduce the expense of enforcing a determination order and may in some cases provide for faster hearings, as there are more sittings of the District Court than the Circuit Court.  Section 57 is subject to a Commencement Order which will be made in Q1 2017.   </p></reply>

The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015.

However the system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal processing times by scheme 01/01/2016 - 30/11/2016</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension</td><td>18.8</td><td>33.8</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td>17.7</td><td>21.7</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td>24.0</td><td>22.4</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>22.2</td><td>39.4</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>14.6</td><td>20.2</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>27.5</td><td>34.6</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td>28.4</td><td>29.8</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>24.4</td><td>30.4</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit</td><td>13.0</td><td>33.9</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>20.0</td><td>25.2</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>23.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Death Benefit (Pension)</td><td>19.7</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>14.2</td><td>16.9</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>19.1</td><td>26.6</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>22.0</td><td>28.3</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>18.8</td><td>21.6</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>20.9</td><td>32.4</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>25.8</td><td>46.3</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>22.8</td><td>33.2</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>67.7</td><td>61.3</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>25.2</td><td>29.6</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>22.7</td><td>26.6</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>27.7</td><td>50.9</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)</td><td>15.9</td><td>23.6</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)</td><td>18.4</td><td>22.1</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>16.5</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>15.8</td><td>21.0</td></tr><tr><td>BTW Family Dividend</td><td>21.0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional</td><td>19.0</td><td>21.1</td></tr><tr><td>Recoverable Benefits &amp;amp; Assistance</td><td>33.1</td><td>31.6</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>15.4</td><td>27.1</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefit</td><td>17.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant *</td><td>18.5</td><td>23.3</td></tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment</td><td>36.8</td><td>85.7</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance</td><td>15.1</td><td>24.6</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)</td><td>16.7</td><td>28.8</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-con)</td><td>18.5</td><td>23.4</td></tr><tr><td>Widows Parent Grant</td><td>23.5</td><td>63.8</td></tr><tr><td>All Appeals</td><td>17.6</td><td>24.2</td></tr></table>* Previously called Respite Care Grant</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-14a.265.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121400069#WRD01900"><p>The Eurostat Statistics on Income and Living Conditions 2014 show that the severe material deprivation rate for lone parent households in Ireland was 25.1% in 2014, reflecting a 7.2 percentage point decrease on the 2013 rate.  This compares to an EU average of 19.2% in 2014. (See the following table)</p><p>My Department estimates spending &euro;500 million on the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme in 2016.  The scheme supports over 40,000 recipients and almost 73,000 children.  The OFP means test is more generous than that of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, with an income disregard of &euro;90 per week in 2016 and the balance assessed at 50%.  In addition OFP can be paid concurrently with the family income supplement (FIS).  These supports encourage lone parents to take-up employment thereby helping to tackle poverty rates among these customers. </p><p>The Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment is available to lone parents (both former OFP recipients and new lone parents), who have a youngest child aged 7 to 13 years inclusive.  These customers are exempt from the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance conditions that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  As such, no lone parent with a youngest child aged under 14 years is required to take-up employment in order to receive income support from the Department.  They can also move into education and/or employment, including into part-time employment, and still receive payment, subject to a means test. </p><p>All Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment recipients receive a one to one meeting with a Case Officer from the Department who assists them to produce a personal development plan and guides them towards appropriate education, training and employment opportunities. </p><p>Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment recipients who are in education and who qualify for the SUSI maintenance grant will not have this grant assessed as means for their payment.</p><p>The Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment is therefore a crucial support for lone parents that allows these customers to balance their work and caring responsibilities and, significantly, reduces their requirement for child care.  The payment also offers a tapered support to these customers as their children get older.</p><p>In Budget 2017 all lone parents on the one-parent family payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  In addition, the income disregards for the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment will rise by &euro;20 from January, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2017 showed that average household incomes increase by 1%.  Non-earning lone parents were the biggest beneficiary of Budget 2017 with gains of 4.5%.  Working lone parents also experienced above average gains at almost 1.2%.</p><p>Severe Material Deprivation Rates for Single Person Households with Dependent Children <table><tr><th></th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>EU-28</td><td>20.7%</td><td>19.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>6.9%</td><td>0.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Luxembourg</td><td>8.9%</td><td>6.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>5.4%</td><td>7.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>12.4%</td><td>9.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>14.8%</td><td>12.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>10.2%</td><td>13.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>10.9%</td><td>13.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>11.9%</td><td>14.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Croatia</td><td>22.0%</td><td>14.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Slovenia</td><td>16.5%</td><td>15.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Estonia</td><td>16.3%</td><td>15.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>16.1%</td><td>17.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Slovakia</td><td>25.5%</td><td>17.2%</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>15.8%</td><td>17.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>22.9%</td><td>17.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>17.7%</td><td>19.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Poland</td><td>27.3%</td><td>21.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Czech Republic</td><td>13.9%</td><td>24.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>32.3%</td><td>25.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Lithuania</td><td>27.2%</td><td>25.1%</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>31.5%</td><td>25.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyprus</td><td>28.1%</td><td>33.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Latvia</td><td>44.3%</td><td>34.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>30.9%</td><td>35.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Malta</td><td>28.1%</td><td>42.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Romania</td><td>44.6%</td><td>42.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Hungary</td><td>44.3%</td><td>47.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Bulgaria</td><td>60.3%</td><td>59.4%</td></tr></table>Extracted 2013 and 2014 figures from Eurostat EU-SILC on 12 December 2016</p></reply>

The ENP scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  </p>  <p>  In 2016 to date, some 84,000 payments have issued in respect of ENPs at a cost of &euro;29 million.

Ireland has co-sponsored a number of proposed resolutions which were all vetoed by Russia and sometimes by China.  The disunity of the Council has undermined the rights of the Syrian people to the protections under international law, giving the Assad regime impunity for its atrocities.  Last week, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution adopted overwhelmingly by the General Assembly, setting out a clear basis for the ending of the systematic violations of the rights of the Syrian people and for a resolution of the conflict.  I believe that all member of the United Nations have an interest and a responsibility to support a peaceful resolution to the Syrian conflict.</p>  <p>  The decision of the Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence to invite any group is solely a matter for the members of the Joint Committee.  I do not propose to comment on their execution of their responsibilities.  I do wish to condemn the Grand Mufti&rsquo;s threat of the use of terrorism.

The Government is of the view that there is a pressing need for an impartial, independent investigation into allegations of human rights violations in this region, as well as the full restoration of access for humanitarian aid.</p>  <p>  The Government regularly highlights its concerns regarding conflict in Rakhine State and the minority Rohingya people at bilateral level and in the context of our membership of the EU and the UN. </p>  <p>  On December 9, Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Bangkok, which is accredited to Myanmar/Burma, joined a number of likeminded diplomatic missions there in a statement which expressed serious concerns about humanitarian aid access to the region.  The statement welcomed the Government of Myanmar&rsquo;s agreement to allow a resumption of humanitarian assistance and initial deliveries to some villages, but expressed serious concerns about delays and urged Myanmar&rsquo;s authorities to overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented a full resumption.  </p>  <p>  In relation to recent attacks against security personnel in Rakhine State and allegations of abuse in the subsequent security operations, the statement said that security forces must ensure protection of all civilians, and that the creation of an Investigation Commission offers an opportunity to investigate these incidents and allegations objectively and transparently, as well as expose acts of violence and abuse.</p>  <p>  The third EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue took place on November 22.  At the meeting, the EU similarly expressed concerns about the recent security and human rights situation in northern Rakhine state, reiterating calls for an independent, credible investigation into both initial attacks and subsequent actions, as well as for the urgent re-opening of humanitarian access to the populations in need.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supported the EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar/Burma at the 31st session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in March, which conveyed the HRC&rsquo;s serious concerns over human rights violations in the country, including the situation in Rakhine State and particularly with respect to religious and ethnic minorities, including the Rohingya minority.  Ireland also raised this issue during the review of Myanmar&rsquo;s human rights record at the HRC&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review in November 2015. </p>  <p>  In addition to these efforts, Ireland has provided development assistance and humanitarian aid to address the needs of people in Rakhine State, including the Rohingya community.  Since 2014 Ireland has provided &euro;284,000 to Plan International for interventions in the region. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government is of the view that the underlying root causes of tensions in Rakhine State must be addressed with long-term solutions led by the Government of Myanmar/Burma.  The need to guarantee respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar/Burma remains central to achieving this.  Ireland has also called for more investment in early recovery and support for livelihood opportunities for both the Rohingya and Buddhist communities in Rakhine State.</p></reply>

To this end, increased funding will be available for ambulance services in 2017.  </p>  <p>  The HIQA report on ambulance services, which was published in December 2014, highlighted significant public safety issues arising from two ambulance services operating in the same domain.  The report identified concerns around the existence of two separate control and dispatch processes, and also highlighted the need for greater clinical governance of both services.  </p>  <p>  The HIQA report points, very clearly, to the need for enhanced integration of service provision in the greater Dublin area.  In that context, the HSE is working closely with Dublin City Council, which is leading on this issue on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, to devise and agree the elements of a safe, sustainable, integrated and quality ambulance service for the citizens of Dublin.  I fully accept that, in the interest of patient safety, we need the DFB and the NAS to have a more coordinated and integrated approach to service delivery.</p>  <p>  The Dublin ambulance services review, which was commissioned in 2014, is focused on identifying a service model for the optimal provision of emergency ambulance services and patient care in the Dublin region, including service quality, patient safety and value for money.  The review's primary objectives are:</p>  <p>  1.  To determine the optimal model of ambulance provision which ensures that patients receive the highest standard of emergency response, and where the care provided meets all national safety and quality standards.</p>  <p>  2.  To determine the most cost effective model of provision going forward, which ensures optimal 'value for money' for the public purse.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Review has recently been completed and is under consideration by the HSE and Dublin City Council, who as I mentioned earlier, commissioned the Review.  While I have yet to be apprised of the detailed outcome of the Review, I can assure the Deputy that before any changes are implemented, a formal proposal for same will be required to be submitted to both myself and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, for our consideration and approval.  I therefore expect that my Department and the Dept of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will, in the coming weeks, continue to engage with the HSE and Dublin City Council, in relation to any changes in service provision which may be proposed.  </p>  <p>  I also expect that the report of the Expert Panel, referred to by the Deputy, which I understand was commissioned by Dublin City Council as part of its internal response to the HIQA report, will help inform the discussions which are currently taking place between the HSE and Dublin City Council in the context of the Dublin Ambulance Service Review, and will help with the development of an overall plan for a more integrated and safer ambulance service, in line with HIQA's recommendations. </p></reply>

It was established, at the request of the Department of Health and Children, by the National Suicide Research Foundation and is funded by the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention.  The outcomes of the Registry continue to highlight the importance of improving access to services for people engaging in self-harm, in line with strategic goals 4 and 7 of Connecting for Life, Ireland&rsquo;s new National Strategy to Reduce Suicide, 2015-2020.  This involves access to real-time surveillance data on self-harm, and improving the provision of psychosocial and psychiatric assessment for self-harm patients in the emergency department, as well as delivering targeted interventions for self-harm.  Additionally, the findings from the Registry provided an informed basis for an on-going five-year research programme into determinants of self-harm and suicide in Ireland.  This programme aims to improve the care for people who engage in self-harm, and to reduce repeated self-harm and suicide.</p>  <p>  The 2015 annual report of the National Suicide Research Foundation collected self-harm data from all 36 acute hospitals which that operated in Ireland during that year.  This report found the rate of self-harm amongst 10-14 year-olds in 2015 to be 178 per 100,000 for females in this age range and 45 per 100,000 for males in this age range.  The Registry does record information on self-harm among children under the age of 10; however, since this concerns a small number of cases per year, rates of self-harm per 100,000 for children under the age of 10 are not calculated.  The Registry also records referrals for patients discharged from the emergency department following self-harm.  In 2015 these referrals included the following: out-patient appointments, recommendations to attend their GP, a recommendation of other services such as psychological services, community-based mental health teams and addiction services, and transfers to another hospital for psychiatric and medical treatment.</p></reply>

My Department, working with the HSE, has been driving a range of measures to improve patient ED experience times. </p>  <p>  Following the formation of Government an additional &euro;40 million was provided to assist in the management of winter pressures.  Utilising this additional funding the HSE  developed the Winter Initiative Plan 2016 &ndash; 2017 which was published in September.  Key aspects of this plan are being implemented at hospital and community services level across the country. </p>  <p>  Recently, the HSE convened a Winter Initiative Health Summit and I met with Hospital Group CEOs, as well as hospital and Community Health Organisation managers, to reinforce the importance of driving key performance improvements across primary, acute and social care to reduce ED overcrowding and to plan for expected surges in demand in our EDs in the New Year.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular queries raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. </p></reply>

While recognising that demand for acute hospital services has increased, the important issue for patients is how long they wait.</p>  <p>  Under the HSE Service Plan 2016 targets, 85% of people should wait less than 52 weeks for their first outpatient appointment.  The latest NTPF Outpatient Waiting List figures indicate that 77% of people in the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore are waiting less than 52 weeks for their first outpatient appointment and 95% of people are waiting less than 18 months for access to outpatient services.  </p>  <p>  In August, I asked the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2016 to reduce by year end the number of patients waiting over 18 months for an inpatient or day case procedure.  Since then, over 8,000 patients have come off the waiting list nationally. </p>  <p>  Regarding outpatient waiting lists in particular, the HSE recently launched the Strategy for the design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020.  It seeks to improve waiting times for outpatient services by enhancing patient referral pathways and utilising technology to enable better planning.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients. &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF in 2017, rising to &euro;55m in 2018. Planning of these initiatives is at an advanced stage.  I will shortly be asking the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017, working collaboratively with the NTPF, to address inpatient, day case and also outpatient waiting times, including in the Mater Hospital.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

The company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.  Each application is considered separately on its merits and in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information /dossier submitted by the company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics). </p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.  Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public;</p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older and weighing less than 25kg.  In March of this year, the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price.  In the economic dossier submitted to the NCPE, the manufacturer estimates that there are 18 patients who may be eligible for early ivacaftor treatment. </p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: . </p><p>As the HSE is responsible for negotiations with manufacturers, I have asked it to reply to the Deputy directly in relation to the status of negotiations with the manufacturer.</p><p>I understand how patients and their families must feel in these circumstances, as they await the decisions by the HSE in relation to reimbursement.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-14a.402.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121400071#WRF00700"><p>I am pleased to set out for the Deputy the ongoing work on prevention and public awareness with respect to Lyme disease.</p><p>Lyme disease (also known as Lyme borreliosis or LB) is an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi that is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases.  Lyme borreliosis is notifiable in Ireland since 2012; the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form of LB: Lyme neuroborreliosis.  </p><p>The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows:</p><p>- 2012 - 8 cases;</p><p>- 2013 - 13 cases;</p><p>- 2014 - 18 cases;</p><p>- 2015 - 12 cases.</p><p>The Weekly Infectious Disease Report for week 48, covering the period 27 November - 3 December, issued by the HPSC on 7 December 2016 indicates that 19 cases of neuroborreliosis have been notified so far this year.  This gives an average annual incidence rate of neuroborreliosis in Ireland of about 2.7 neuroborreliosis cases per million population. </p><p>Since 2013, the HPSC has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease.  The week beginning May 2nd was designated as Lyme Awareness Week this year. </p><p>The literature on the HPSC website points out that campers, walkers and certain occupational groups such as forestry workers, conservation workers, deer cullers and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to ticks (and therefore LB).  That said, anyone walking or hiking in the countryside is at risk of biting ticks.  The ticks responsible for LB are generally hard-bodied ticks (Ixodidae).  Ixodes ticks are hosted by a wide range of mammals including deer, sheep and cows, and occasionally birds; their tiny size (less than 2mm unfed) means they can remain undetected for long periods.</p><p>Ixodes ticks are most likely to be found in:</p><p>- Shady and humid woodland clearings with grass;</p><p>- Open grassland, walking paths (especially those bordered by long grasses);</p><p>- Wooded and forested areas;</p><p>- Vegetation close to lakes and seaside beaches;</p><p>- Parkland areas; and</p><p>- Open fields and bushes.</p><p>They are present in both urban and rural environments and are active from spring to autumn.  Lyme cases tend to appear in Ireland with greater frequency after April, hence the choice of this time of year for Lyme Awareness Week. </p><p>Both the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and Tick Talk Ireland provide guidance on protection against contracting Lyme borelliosis.  The best protection is to prevent tick bites, when walking in grassy, bushy or woodland areas, particularly between May and October:</p><p>- Arms and legs should be covered; wearing long trousers tucked into socks or boots, and long-sleeved shirts with cuffs fastened is advised.  Shoes or boots should be worn rather than open-toed sandals;</p><p>- The use of insect repellent on clothes is recommended, or on limbs if it is not practicable to cover up.  DEET or permethrin (insect repellents) can be used &ndash; advice can be obtained from pharmacies;</p><p>- Skin and clothing should be inspected for ticks every three to four hours and children's skin and clothes checked frequently.</p><p>- Ticks should be removed as soon as they are seen attached to the skin.  Further advice on tick removal can be obtained from the HPSC website;</p><p>- It is not recommended that antibiotics are given to prevent the transmission of Lyme disease following a tick bite.  Only if the area becomes inflamed may treatment be required; and advice should be sought from a doctor; and</p><p>- People should see their doctor if they develop a rash or become unwell with other symptoms, letting the doctor know of exposure to ticks.</p><p>Further advice can be obtained from the HPSC website (www.hpsc.ie) and the HPSC produced a leaflet on &ldquo;<i>Protecting Yourself Against Tick Bites and Lyme Disease</i>&rdquo; which is available for the public to download.</p><p>In addition, a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme carrying ticks can be most expected to be found.</p></reply>

The National Sexual Health Strategy aims to improve sexual health and well-being, and reduce negative sexual health outcomes by ensuring that everyone living in Ireland has access to high quality sexual health information, education and services throughout their lives.  It takes a life-course approach to sexual health and represents the first nationally coordinated approach to improving the population&rsquo;s sexual health and well-being.</p>  <p>  The Strategy contains 71 recommendations that address a wide spectrum of sexual health services, and places strong emphasis on access to information and education.  It signals a change in sexual health services from current provision, which has its origins in regional responses to specific sexual health issues, to a national strategy to provide high quality sexual health services to the whole population as required.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Sexual health promotion, education and prevention&rsquo; represents one of the three overarching domains in the Strategy, and was a priority in the 2015-2016 Action Plan.  The Plan contains specific actions to support parents in engaging with their children on sexual health issues, and includes actions that aim to improve young people&rsquo;s experience of sexual health education in the education system by providing better training and resources for teachers and youth workers.  </p>  <p>  The HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme is charged with implementing most of the National Sexual Health Strategy 2015&ndash;2020, and with developing and implementing a national strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in Ireland.  It aims to improve the effectiveness and impact of sexual health services and prevention, as set out in the National Sexual Health Strategy.</p></reply>

My Department wrote to the Health Service Executive on 16 November asking it to satisfy itself that health professionals and all relevant staff are familiar and operating in compliance with this legislation and to give consideration as to whether there is a need for any additional guidance in order to ensure that the public interest is safeguarded in all respects.  I have also asked the HSE to undertake an assessment of existing protocols and procedures in relation to the receipt of funding or other benefits from pharmaceutical companies by its employees and the services for which it has responsibility. </p><p>In addition, the Medicinal Products (Control of Advertising) Regulations 2007 govern the advertising of medicines, and provide for a range of restrictions on gifts, hospitality and sponsorship of meetings.  For example, a gift must be inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy.  Hospitality must be reasonable in level, strictly limited to the main purpose or scientific objective of the event, and not extended to persons other than health professionals.  Health professionals are also prohibited from soliciting or accepting any prohibited inducement, hospitality or sponsorship.  Breaches of the Regulations may be prosecuted in the courts under section 32 of the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1996 and 2006.</p><p>Regulation of the medical profession is undertaken by the Medical Council, which updated its <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners</i>in May 2016.

The company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.  Each application is considered separately on its merits and in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information /dossier submitted by the company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics). </p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.  Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p><p>1. the health needs of the public; </p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services; </p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; </p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks; </p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item; </p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item; </p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older and weighing less than 25kg.

The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price.

Two dedicated divisions comprised of specialists including human toxicologists, environmental toxicologists, chemists, environmental chemists, efficacy experts and biologists supported by other Divisions of my Department and when necessary, other Departments and State agencies, ensure that Ireland has a robust pesticide approval process.  In addition, control of pesticide use in the form of pesticide residue monitoring, pesticide application equipment testing as well as training of operators, distributors and advisors coupled with a rigorous retail wholesale and farm inspection programme ensures a extremely visible presence in the sector.  This, coupled with the regulatory process in the EU, which is among the most conservative in the world, you provides assurance that consumers, farm operatives and the general public are not at risk from plant protection products and biocides on farm, when used as directed on the labels.  The Irish and EU systems are such that the health and welfare of both citizens and the environment takes primacy over other considerations.  The removal of hundreds of pesticides from the Irish market (which are still available in other OECD countries) over the last 20 years is testament to this.   </p>  <p>  In relation to continued approval of glyphosate in the EU, an evaluation was performed by Germany and peer reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Member State experts.  This review  identified the safety profile of glyphosate and considered a recent review conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO).  Reviews conducted by the relevant authorities in New Zealand, Australia and the United States derive similar but less conservative conclusions. In addition a further review of glyphosate by the European Chemicals Agency is currently ongoing.  This review will consider the classification of the active substance and should be available in the later part of 2017. </p></reply>

The level of illegal stockpiles would suggest that it is often not properly applied.</p>  <p>  The regulations I am introducing will formalise this fee and ensure that it is used correctly to support the sound environmental treatment of waste tyres. As things stand, the consumer pays on the double &ndash; first, when they purchase new tyres and then again, through their taxation when local authorities have to remove illegal tyre stockpiles across the country. </p>  <p>  The Compliance Scheme will be operated by Repak End of Life Tyres (ELT) with a registration and reporting role for the Producer Register Limited. Repak ELT will operate on a not-for-profit basis and its primary function will be to carry out all regulatory functions on behalf of its members.  </p>  <p>  I met with some tyre industry representatives recently who contended that the visible Environmental Management Charge (vEMC) will cause a distortion in the market, with non-compliant operators undercutting compliant ones. I have, however,  received a lot of support during the extensive consultation that has taken place from other parts of the tyre industry for the introduction of the scheme. These operators understand that the scheme will lead to greater visibility and traceability of tyres coming on and off the market and that it creates a level playing field for all economic operators.</p>  <p>  I am convinced that the new structures I will be introducing together with a strong enforcement regime by the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) and the EPA can address this issue.</p></reply>

The scheme intends to demonstrate the positive effects that making their homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and well-being of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition.</p><p>As it is a pilot scheme, eligibility is limited.  The operational area for the scheme was selected as Community Health Area (CHO) 7, following consultation with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This CHO encompasses Kildare/West Wicklow, Dublin West, Dublin South City and Dublin South West.  Within CHO 7 the need to build capacity in the local public health and SEAI teams, and establish communications on the pilot with the local community, meant that a further localisation was necessary and Dublin 12 and 24 were selected as the initial operational areas. </p><p>With the additional resources I have made available to the scheme in 2017, the steering committee for the scheme, made up of representatives from my Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the Department of Health and the HSE, determined that the area covered by the scheme could be expanded to cover Dublin 8, 10 and 22 and that eligibility could be expanded to cover families with young children.  By including families with young children it is hoped that the scheme can also show a positive impact on school attendance and social inclusion. </p><p>The scheme is intended to run for a further two years (2017-2018).  In parallel with the scheme&rsquo;s delivery, an independent research project will be commissioned by my Department, which will assess the impact the scheme is having.

Across the EU there is no maximum weight 'norm' for such vehicles and a lacuna in Ireland's Construction and Use Regulations has meant that a maximum weight limit for such vehicles has hitherto remained unstipulated.</p>  <p>  It is precisely to correct this regulatory anomaly that Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority (RSA), were tasked with analysing the pavement wear effects of this 39 tonne variant, as well as the associated vehicle standard related requirements attaching to the operation of 5 axle rigids in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The results of TII's commissioned study concluded that, because of their shorter wheel base they impacted negatively on both our bridge infrastructure and pavements. In circumstances, where in real terms, road maintenance funding has been severely cut over successive years, it was therefore recommended that the maximum regulatory weight limit for such vehicles should be set at 36 tonnes.  The results of TII's study were presented to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and other interested industry representative bodies.</p>  <p>  A regulatory exemption, subject to certain technical requirements and manufacturer approval, will however apply to those rigids with five (or more) axles which are in service before 1 March 2017.  Separately, the RSA is working with the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) so that the registration details of the owners of 4 axle rigids who've had a fifth axle fitted under the existing arrangements, and who have not yet accurately updated their details on the NVDF, can do so by the 1 February 2017.​</p></reply>

For the sake of clarity, my Department has not declined to provide the information sought by the Deputy.  As explained in my response it was not possible to provide the extensive detail being sought by the Deputy in the limited time available for response.</p>  <p>  It should be appreciated that the Deputy is seeking 9 years of payroll data spread over 11 different pay bands.  There are currently 1,100 people on the Department&rsquo;s payroll and the indicative total of all records falling under the scope of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions will be in excess of 11,000 records spanning back to 2007. </p>  <p>  By way of context, my Department&rsquo;s payroll operation has not yet transitioned to the centralised Payroll Shared Services provided through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The scheduling of different Department&rsquo;s transitioning into the Payroll Shared Services operations has been undertaken on a tranched basis, Department by Department.  This process has been undertaken at a timescale organised and overseen by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department is, therefore, not yet in a position to avail of the benefits of the Payroll Shared Services greater analytical capacity.  My Department, however, is scheduled to transition to Payroll Shared Services next summer. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department&rsquo;s Payroll software is not as customised to the same extent as Payroll Shared Services.  Therefore facilitation of such extensive data requests, such as these made by the Deputy spanning over 9 years, can take longer to be finalised. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I have requested my officials to work on this issue as a matter of urgency and I hope that the detailed information requested can be provided to the Deputy very shortly.</p></reply>

To go some way towards addressing this, I have secured additional funding of &euro;14 million in Budget 2017 which will enable ECCE providers to be paid for a 39th week and part of a 40th week (7 ECCE days in total or 1.4 ECCE weeks) where they will have no children present and they will be able to pay staff to concentrate on administrative workload. Services themselves can decide how to use the payment when it is received.  For the average ECCE service with 25 children, this will mean an additional annual payment of approximately &euro;2,400 per annum. Part of the additional funding &euro;14m will be given to CCS and TEC providers on a pro-rata basis also to acknowledge their administrative burden also . The Affordable Childcare Scheme when introduced in Sept 17 will replace CCS and TEC and will have recognition of non-contact time built into its cost base. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to conducting and publishing an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare.  This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of a new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme and is currently being progressed in that context. Work is well underway on the development of policy proposals for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  As part of this, Department officials are reviewing previous published research and analysis on the cost of childcare provision, are assessing available data sources and are scoping the precise requirements for the independent review.  </p>  <p>  Under the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, registered providers of pre-school services will, from 31 December 2016, be required to ensure that each employee working directly with children attending the service holds at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework or a qualification deemed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to be equivalent.  The Learner Fund was introduced in 2014 to provide support for existing childcare staff to achieve this minimum requirement.  The fund was later expanded to support existing pre-school leaders to up-skill to Level 6 on the National Qualifications Framework, which is now the minimum requirement for pre-school leaders delivering the Early childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;1.5m will be available in 2017 to continue to Level 6 support in the context of the expansion of the ECCE programme.  I also hope to extend the Learner Fund to support childcare staff to achieve higher level qualifications in childcare, i.e. Fetac Level 7 and Level 8.  In this regard, my Department, in association with the Department of Education and Skills and Pobal, intends to commence work as soon as possible on the development of an approved panel of Level 7 and Level 8 training providers, and a new Learner Fund application process.</p>  <p>  I also hope to be in a position to make some funding available to those childcare staff who have already completed higher level courses entirely at their own expense.</p></reply>

My Department and Tusla will work to ensure that any accommodation proposed, and ultimately delivered, will be provided with the appropriate levels of protective factors for the young person making the transition to independent living.</p></reply>

These include families where parents have drug or alcohol problems, or suffer mental ill-health.  Children who live in homes where they are exposed to domestic violence are also at risk.  I wish to assure the Deputy that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, deals immediately with emergency cases, where for instance, a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse. </p>  <p>  Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Preliminary screening and initial assessments of concerns are undertaken to decide the best course of action for the child and their family.  It should be noted that approximately 50% of all referrals do not proceed to initial assessment.  This is due to a number of factors including duplication of referrals, child already known to Tusla or in receipt of services, or the referral was not deemed to be appropriate. </p>  <p>  Following initial assessment, the case remains with the duty team, who monitor risk until the case is allocated to a dedicated social worker.  Over half of all referrals received by Tusla are welfare concerns and Tusla's policy is to refer these to relevant family and community support services. If it seems that the problem relates to abuse of the child, the child protection pathway is followed.  </p>  <p>  Children First National Guidance (2011) gives advice for notifying Tusla of situations where abuse is suspected.  A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk. Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla. </p>  <p>  The Children First Act, 2015, once it is fully commenced, will place a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  It is my intention that these provisions will be commenced by the end of 2017. </p>  <p>  Early intervention in the lives of vulnerable children is a key priority of mine.  Tusla through its Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme is a joint prevention and early intervention initiative led by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.  The aim of the programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches in 13 areas of disadvantage to improve outcomes for children, in particular children and families living in poverty. </p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2016, funding of &euro;51m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  In addition &euro;2.6m in capital funding, also provided in Budget 2016, will be used to support small scale projects, including refurbishment, health and safety fit-outs and accessibility improvements in local youth services.</p>  <p>  In 2016, an amount of &euro;500,405 has been allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland.  My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.   </p>  <p>  I was pleased to launch the &ldquo;the Hive&rdquo;, Kildare Town Youth Hub in June 2016.  My Department has provided &euro;50,000 in capital funding towards the cost of developing this youth caf&eacute; facility which offers a safe environment for young people.  </p>  <p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet, regularly with many voluntary organisations and groups providing services to children and young people to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.  Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the development of the policies and services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning. </p></reply>

This is being addressed through the Area-Based Childhood programme, the development of a Quality and Capacity Building initiative, and supporting relevant priorities of other Government Departments.  As part of this, the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>which brings together members of the community and voluntary sector as well as independent experts, has worked on a number of priority areas including homelessness and child poverty.  Members of the Council and officials from my Department recently met with representatives from Focus Ireland and St. Vincent de Paul to progress these issues.</p><p>My Department funds the County and City Childcare Committees and Childcare Committees Ireland to provide business support to services.  Funding is also provided to Better Start to provide a quality support service and to Pobal who undertake compliance visits on behalf of this Department and the Department of Education and Skills who provide education focussed support to childcare providers.</p><p>My Department also administers a range of funding schemes and targeted programmes that support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.

Children living in direct provision are not in the care of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. Concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in direct provision are referred to Tusla, in line with Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  Tusla has been working closely with the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The needs of children in direct provision relate to education, preschool, development and health and where needed, they will be referred to relevant services.  Tusla provides services that offer advice and support to families in their parenting role.  This includes family support workers, social workers, youth workers, family resource centres, support groups and counselling services. </p>  <p>  The Child and Family Services Unit within RIA has a post for a seconded member of Tusla, and links are made to the HSE, GPs, Tusla and voluntary and community groups as necessary.  The role of this Unit is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan matters relating to the health and welfare of children and families living in the direct provision system.</p>  <p>  Children are protected in a number of ways in the direct provision system - primarily through RIA&rsquo;s child protection policy.  Referrals include welfare concerns for a child when a parent is hospitalised and there is no family member to care for the child, ongoing parental illness, or parental mental health problems, while a smaller number relate to child protection concerns.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality established a working group to review a range of issues pertaining to asylum seekers and direct provision; the Report of the Working Group on the Protection Process was published in June 2015.  The report identified that direct provision, while satisfactory as a support to families in the short term, was not an environment conducive to family life over the longer term.  Tusla has been engaging with the HSE and RIA on progressing the recommendations from this report.  Also the enactment of the International Protection Act, 2015 greatly simplifies the process for those entering direct provision, and aims to reduce the time spent there significantly. </p></reply>

I am satisfied that Tusla takes its responsibility very seriously regarding the welfare of children in care and that there is a robust framework of regulations and standards, to ensure that children are placed in safe and caring settings.   </p>  <p>  Tusla, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on child safety and protection services.  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note.  The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required such as the recruitment of additional social workers including link workers.  The additional funding of &euro;37 million which has been secured for Tusla in 2017 will provide increased resources for this extra recruitment. </p>  <p>  All foster care organisations and statutory residential centres are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), and private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against national standards.  These inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by my officials.  The overview from these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children at risk. </p>  <p>  Additional information is gleaned from the National Review Panel reports on individual cases and findings from investigations conducted by the Ombudsman for Children.  Officials meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the overall level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.  I meet on a regular basis with the CEO and Chair of Tusla. Contact is maintained with the non-governmental bodies on issues within the sector, including, for example, the Children's Rights Alliance, EPIC and the Irish Foster Care Association.</p></reply>
