The Directive requires all member states to define set periods when the land application of fertiliser, including slurry, is not allowed and in Ireland the closed season commenced on 15 October.  </p>  <p>  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was introduced.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice.  The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s ongoing Agricultural Catchments Programme has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the prohibited spreading periods in reducing nutrient losses to waters.   </p>  <p>  Ireland faces considerable challenges in meeting the requirements of the Water Framework Directive to bring all waters back to good status at least.  Taking those challenges and the evidence in support of the benefit of closed periods into consideration, I am not proposing any blanket variation at the present time to the terms of the NAP.   </p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) have closely monitored the situation and a number of farmers experiencing particular animal welfare concerns arising from an inability to spread slurry before 15 October were contacted by the DAFM who advised them of the appropriate action to take.  I understand that a round 70 farmers were contacted by DAFM in this regard and the specific concerns have now been alleviated.   </p></reply>

As is required under the SDZ process, there is a comprehensive planning scheme in place, approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, for the development of up to 8,000 homes as well as retail and supporting services and amenities provided for within the SDZ.    </p>  <p>  I am confident that there will be significant delivery of all housing types, including social housing, as an integral part of this area's development, as well as the provision of housing that is intrinsically affordable for the broad range of households likely to settle in the area including low- and middle-income earners seeking properties to rent or buy. </p>  <p>  Implementing Part V alone will provide for some 800 new social housing units to be delivered.  It will be a matter for the developers, the housing authority (in this case, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council) and other housing providers such as Approved Housing Bodies to consider if additional State-supported housing should be provided on this site, in line with the approved planning scheme and the county development plan. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the overall market development of housing on this site will depend on such provision and investment being viable, relative to what prospective residents can afford in relation to purchase and rental costs.  Cognisant of the imperative around ensuring viability of developments and affordability of the housing from those developments for households, the Government has progressed a range of relevant measures, including a targeted development contribution rebate scheme, updated statutory guidelines on apartment developments, the &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) and wider planning reforms, including the provision for improved timelines in making planning decisions.   </p>  <p>  Taken together, I believe that these measures will further support the delivery of both State-supported and affordable homes, not only in Cherrywood, but across other major residential sites throughout Dublin and other urban areas. </p></reply>

This is reflected in the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland that by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in limited circumstances for emergency accommodation for families.  It is intended that this will be achieved by meeting their housing needs through the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and general housing allocations, and by providing new supply to be delivered through an expanded Rapid Build Housing Programme and a Housing Agency initiative to acquire vacant houses.  </p><p>My Department is working closely with local authorities and with the Housing Agency towards the achievement of these actions and initiatives.  For example, a record level of exits from homelessness - 1,350 &ndash; was delivered by local authorities in the first six months of this year and the level of activity in this regard has continued to accelerate.  As of 14 November 2016, 594 HAP tenancies had been created for homeless households under the Homeless pilot of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, already exceeding the end-year target of 550 set in Rebuilding Ireland. </p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness contains a clear commitment to provide regular progress updates, particularly through quarterly progress reports.  The first quarterly progress report (in respect of Quarter 3 commitments and actions) was published on 1 November, and can be accessed through the Rebuilding Ireland website, <i>www.rebuildingireland.ie.</i>Further progress reports will be published on a quarterly basis, with the next report due to be published in January 2017.  Each Quarterly Report will focus on the actions due to be progressed or completed in the preceding quarter.</p></reply>

Further information on the NTICI can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at a link that will be circulated with the Official Report.</p><p>[<i></i>]. </p><p>Baseline surveys carried out to inform the development of the NTICI in December 2015 indicated that, of the 5,566 housing developments yet to be taken in charge, there were approximately 914 estates with developer-provided infrastructure (DPI).</p><p>Under the terms of the NTICI, only those developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the call for proposals for pilot funding under Circular FPS3.  It is important to recall that NTICI is not intended to establish a rolling annual funding programme to take in charge all estates not yet taken in charge but was instead intended to develop better knowledge and systems to support the taking in charge of further estates over time. </p><p>Nationally, 353 developments were approved for funding under the NTICI and of these, 44 contain stand-alone treatment plants or developer-provided infrastructure, which is the focus of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</p><p>Seven local authorities were allocated funding of some &euro;2.7m under Measure 2 of the NTICI in relation to DPI type infrastructure.  To date, six of those local authorities have drawn funding totalling almost &euro;900,000.  Works are in progress and further updates are due from the relevant local authorities later this month .</p><p>With regard to the position in Donegal, the December 2015 survey that preceded the NTICI indicated a total of 281 developments with stand-alone wastewater treatment plants and, of these, 154 developments are subject to on-hand applications to be taken in charge.  In respect of these, Donegal County Council was allocated approximately &euro;634,000 in NTICI funding to progress 8 housing estates with stand-alone wastewater treatment plants to bring them to taking-in-charge standard.  I understand that these works are progressing and some &euro;313,000 has been drawn down to date.</p><p>I intend that the experience and learning from the operation of the NTICI over the course of 2016 will be used to point the way forward in relation to supporting the taking in charge process in future.  </p></reply>

Implementation of this initiative is being led by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  This centre will have multi-agency participation including the Dublin housing authorities, Tusla, Family Mediation Services, the Department of Social Protection, tenancy protection services and expert NGOs.  The services concerned will work together to assess and support families with children presenting as homeless to ensure every effort is made to keep them in their current homes or to ensure appropriate homeless and other support services are provided.  DRHE has indicated that it remains on track to have this One-Stop-Shop in place by the end of the year.  The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness contains a clear commitment to provide regular progress updates, particularly through quarterly progress reports.

Compliance with the requirements of this Directive is reported annually by the Environmental Protection Agency in their Urban Waste Water Treatment Report.  In September 2013, the European Commission commenced formal infringement proceedings against Ireland regarding non-compliance with the requirements of the Directive in the case of certain named agglomerations.  An additional letter of formal notice issued from the European Commission in September 2015.  </p>  <p>  In January 2016, my Department, assisted by Irish Water, and in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, responded to the Commission in relation to the infringement.  The response set out the plans in place, including timeframes, to ensure compliance.  This was followed by a 6 monthly progress update which was sent to the European Commission in July 2016.   </p>  <p>  In September 2016, a reasoned opinion on this infringement issued from the European Commission.  My Department, with the support of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Irish Water, is currently preparing a response which will be completed before the end of November 2016.  While these legal proceedings are still ongoing against the State, it would be inappropriate of me to comment further on the matter .   </p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels, including the management of urban waste water collection and treatment infrastructure.  Irish Water has set out in its Water Services Strategic Plan its approach and strategies for the delivery of these services in a manner that will protect the environment and provide wastewater services in an efficient and economic manner.  The strategic approach involved, supported by the planned investment for the period to 2021 outlined in more detail in Irish Water&rsquo;s Business Plan, will play a critical role in ultimately supporting Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with relevant EU water legislation.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-17a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111700056#WRA02000"><p>My Department routinely monitors the planning process and acts to ensure it facilitates appropriate multi-unit housing developments to meet the broader housing requirements of society.  The Dublin Housing Supply and Co-ordination Task Force indicates that sufficient planning permissions are in place in Dublin to yield almost 27,000 new dwellings, whereas only approximately 126 sites, producing around 4,000 dwellings, are active.  This leaves around 22,000 dwellings uncommenced on approved sites. </p>  <p>  While securing a planning permission is obviously important, having the funds or available potential purchasers necessary to support the activation of a permission is equally important.  This is why tackling our current housing crisis demands a whole-of-Government approach, covering budgetary and financing issues, as well as planning and housing policy matters. </p>  <p>  The publication of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness reflects the commitment to that whole-of-Government approach, with the theme of the third Pillar, &ldquo;Building More Homes&rdquo;, in particular setting the objective to more than double housing output between now and 2021. </p>  <p>  In addition, and prior to the launch of Rebuilding Ireland, my Department progressed several measures identified in the policy package, Stabilising Rents - Boosting Supply, including publication of updated statutory guidelines on apartment developments, which addressed inconsistencies in development plan policies.   </p>  <p>  More recently, the establishment of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) has commenced a process for providing &euro;200m for infrastructure investment over the 2017 to 2019 period, opening up key sites for early development and delivery in an economically efficient manner, and promoting affordable supply in the areas of greatest need. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 commenced debate in the Seanad this week, providing for a radical new approach to streamlining the planning process for urgently needed large-scale housing proposals.  This is a response to a review of cases recently decided by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which showed typical periods of up to 18-20 months to get approval for major residential developments from pre-planning consultations through to the final appeal determination. </p>  <p>  Acknowledging the complexities of the housing market, the reasons why so many permissions have not been commenced and supply is lagging behind evident demand are multifaceted and no one single fix is going to address the issues.  However, I believe that through the multiplicity of actions currently being progressed, the Government will create the conditions required for the restoration of a more sustainable and normally functioning housing market capable of providing the homes that people need, where and when they need them.</p></reply>

The scheme was  launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016, on a pilot basis, and it is my intention that the scheme will be available nationally by April 2017  . </p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency met with representatives from both local authorities as recently as last week and I understand that the pilot is progressing well at a local level. Waterford and Carlow have been advertising the scheme with local media and have made good progress in engagements with property owners.  Inspections of potential units have also commenced.   </p>  <p>  Several AHBs will be working together with the Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas and, as the scheme becomes available nationally, I expect that more AHBs will become involved over time and as the scheme is rolled out nationally. </p>  <p>  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I will be making up to &euro;140m available.  It is expected that 150 units will be delivered in 2017 and based on the early progress of the scheme in both Carlow and Waterford to date, I am confident that we will achieve those numbers.</p></reply>

The best way to address rents in the long term, and benefit the entire sector, is to increase the supply of rental accommodation and accelerate also the delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors.  However, I acknowledge that there is a need for short-term measures also.   </p>  <p>Pillar 4 of the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector.  The strategy will include measures to address immediate issues affecting the supply, cost and accessibility of accommodation.  In addition , the strategy will consider measures to increase security of tenure and, in particular, the potential of new mechanisms for both setting and reviewing rents.  There will also be a focus on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply. </p>  <p>  The strategy will provide a vision of the role that the rental sector will play in the short, medium and long term in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives for the housing sector.  I expect it to be finalised before the end of the year.   </p>  <p>  Some of the measures in the rental strategy will require supporting amendments to be made to the Residential Tenancies Act.  However, other legislative changes are being accelerated for early enactment in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016, which commenced Second Stage in the Seanad yesterday.  Tenants and landlords alike will therefore see a number of improvements in place arising from these legislative provisions.   </p>  <p>  The key challenge is to ensure the development of a viable and sustainable rental sector that can provide choice, quality, value and security for households together with secure, attractive investment opportunities for rental providers.  </p></reply>

Part L of the Building Regulations deals with the conservation of fuel &amp;amp; energy and applies equally to all new social housing and new private housing.  In respect of dwellings, taking the energy efficiency requirements established in 2005 as the benchmark, the current requirement delivers a 60% aggregate improvement in both energy and carbon performance.

The Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) provided the overarching framework for the pyrite remediation scheme and its eligibility criteria are reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of that report.  The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated unless or until they exhibit significant pyritic damage.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.</p><p>The <font color="#2F2F2F">pyrite remediation scheme </font>is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion or to review the scheme in this regard .</p><p>Given that the scheme does not apply to dwellings which have a Damage Condition Rating of 1, the Pyrite Resolution Board does not maintain records on the number of properties that fall into this category.  Nevertheless, the Board is aware that 7 dwellings, which had a Damage Condition Rating of 1 when their building condition assessments were first completed, and which were refused under the scheme, have now progressed to a Damage Condition Rating of 2; these dwellings have now been included in the pyrite remediation scheme following the submission of new applications.  </p></reply>

Activity by institutional and professional residential sector investment specialists such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) in purchasing housing and engaging in the building out of part completed schemes and commencing new housing projects is a positive signal of investment beginning to flow back into the housing sector to provide the housing that people need.  The acquisition and management of properties by professional Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) is one component part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and tenants.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation. </p>  <p>  Historically the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation.  However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects, is more stable and less exposed to property market risk and volatility.  Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  Attracting large-scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector that tenants deserve.   </p>  <p>The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive sets out the requirements for the collection, treatment and discharge of waste water from urban areas/agglomerations.  Compliance with the requirements of this Directive is reported annually by the Environmental Protection Agency in their Urban Waste Water Treatment Report.  In September 2013, the European Commission commenced formal infringement proceedings against Ireland regarding non-compliance with the requirements of the Directive in the case of certain named agglomerations.  An additional letter of formal notice issued from the European Commission in September 2015.  </p>  <p>  In January 2016, my Department, assisted by Irish Water, and in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, responded to the Commission in relation to the infringement.  The response set out the plans in place, including timeframes, to ensure compliance.  This was followed by a 6 monthly progress update which was sent to the European Commission in July 2016.   </p>  <p>  In September 2016, a reasoned opinion on this infringement issued from the European Commission.  My Department, with the support of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Irish Water, is currently preparing a response which will be completed before the end of November 2016.  While these legal proceedings are still ongoing against the State, it would be inappropriate of me to comment further on the matter.   </p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels, including the management of urban waste water collection and treatment infrastructure.

According to the most recent Census data available, almost one-fifth of the population lives in the rental sector and there are now over 324,000 tenancies registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  In publishing the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Government has set out a practical and readily implementable set of actions to create a functioning and sustainable housing system.  The Plan is available at the website <i><i>www.rebuildingireland.ie.</i></i></p><p>The Plan is divided into five pillars, with each targeting a specific area of the housing system for attention.  </p><p>Pillar 4 of the Plan commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector.  The strategy will be structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  My Department has just completed a public consultation process, and has received a number of submissions from a wide range of stakeholders, which will contribute to shaping the strategy.</p><p>In developing the strategy, all key measures to promote long-term tenancies and provide for increased security of tenure will be explored.  One of the specific measures that will fall to be considered under the heading of security is the scope for a move to indefinite leases, replacing the Part 4 four-year tenancy, along with measures which might encourage landlords to waive their right to terminate a tenancy in the event of the sale of the property.</p><p>Some of the measures in the rental strategy may require supporting amendments to be made to the Residential Tenancies Act.  However, other legislative changes are being accelerated for early introduction in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016, the debate on which commenced in the Seanad yesterday.  The Bill includes measures to prevent a future recurrence of situations where large numbers of residents in a single development are simultaneously served with termination notices, together with other early actions to enhance the Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s (RTB) enforcement and dispute resolution powers.  Tenants and landlords alike will therefore see a number of improvements on foot of this legislation .</p><p>The overarching objective of the strategy will be to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering true choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.</p></reply>

Thereafter, the relevant development agency within the meaning of Section 165 of the Act, usually the relevant local authority, is responsible for drawing up a detailed planning scheme or masterplan for the designated area.  </p>  <p>  The preparation of such a planning scheme demands extensive engagement with, and commitments from, a range of stakeholders, including relevant State Agencies and Government Departments, to ensure a reasonable degree of certainty that, within broader budgetary and fiscal considerations, the implementation of the planning scheme will be supported by a programme of delivery in relation to relevant transport, social and other infrastructural requirements.     </p>  <p>  Where the decision of the relevant local authority to adopt such a planning scheme is appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Board independently assesses the planning scheme.   </p>  <p>  As part of the Construction 2020 Strategy, my Department reviewed broad arrangements in relation to the SDZ process and as a result, decided to progress amendments to the legislative provisions surrounding SDZs, principally concerning the review mechanisms, which ultimately were approved by the Oireachtas as part of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015.   </p>  <p>  I am therefore satisfied that, having set a broad legislative and policy framework for the identification and implementation of SDZ designations, and having conducted a review of the arrangements involved, existing arrangements in relation to institutional and infrastructural engagement around the implementation of SDZs are sufficient.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation, and related services, for homeless persons rests with housing authorities.  It is fully recognised that the period of time that families spend in emergency hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation should be minimised.  This is reflected in the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness that by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in limited circumstances for emergency accommodation for families.  This will be achieved by meeting their housing needs through the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and general housing allocations, and by providing new supply to be delivered through an expanded Rapid Delivery Housing Programme and a Housing Agency initiative to acquire vacant houses.  My Department is working closely with housing authorities and the Housing Agency towards the achievement of these actions and initiatives.

In addition, over the period in question, the City Council supported Approved Housing Bodies to provide an additional 991 homes for applicants from its waiting list, while also sourcing over 1,400 units under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.

As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system enables more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation.  Under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. </p>  <p>  More effective democratic representation and local decision making is provided by the new system in which a wide range of local functions are devolved to the elected members at district level with more strategic matters decided by the plenary county.  Unlike the uneven patchwork of separate town councils with outdated boundaries which it replaced, this is a comprehensive sub-county system, with membership in common between district and county levels, rational allocation of functions between levels, and a single administrative and operational structure.</p>  <p>  In 2015, which was the first full year of the revised local government structures, a broadly based Advisory Group was convened to carry out a review of their operation, in conjunction with a Local Government Forum for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government.  Feedback from these deliberations and the results of surveys of local authority members and chief executives, indicate that the revised structures are generally operating well but will need more time to bed down fully.  The results of this operational review will provide a key input to the consideration of issues in the preparation of a report for Government and the Oireachtas by mid-2017, pursuant to the Programme for a Partnership Government, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issue of town or borough council status.</p>  <p>  Initial scoping work in relation to this report is being undertaken in my Department, and will identify in greater detail the specific issues and options which will fall to be addressed and the approach to be followed in relation to consultation.  Decisions will be a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas, as appropriate, following consideration of the report.</p>  <p>  Separately, and in line with the PPG commitment, the development of the National Planning Framework is underway and will take into account all of the relevant inputs and statutory requirements.  It would be inappropriate at this early stage to comment on the likely content of the Framework, until sufficient preparatory and consultative work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.

It is the responsibility of the tenant to raise the finance to purchase the house.  A tenant may fund the purchase money for a house from a mortgage loan and/or their own resources which may include funds provided by family members. </p>  <p>  To be eligible for this Scheme, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.  This is in order to ensure that they are in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.   </p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.  The only income that can be included is the income of the tenants of the house. </p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government and reaffirmed in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, it is intended that a review of the Scheme will be undertaken in January 2017 following the first 12 months of operation.

The strategy will provide a vision of the role that the rental sector will play in the short, medium and long term, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives for the housing sector.</p><p>Some of the measures in the rental strategy will require supporting amendments to be made to the Residential Tenancies Act.  However, other legislative changes are being accelerated for early enactment in the <i>Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 </i>which commenced Second Stage in the Seanad yesterday.  The Bill includes measures to prevent a future recurrence of situations where large numbers of residents in a single development are simultaneously served with termination notices to facilitate vacant possession and sale of the property.  These are accompanied by a number of other early actions to enhance the Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s (RTB) enforcement and dispute resolution powers.

This process provides for extensive public and stakeholder consultation with the adoption of any LAP being a reserved function of the elected members of the relevant local authority.  To assist the local authority elected members and executives, the public and wider stakeholders in the LAP making process, my Department prepared and issued <i>Local Area Plans Guidelines for Planning Authorities</i>in June 2013 under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).  These statutory guidelines include practical advice on all aspect s relating to the preparation and adoption of LAPs, including the phasing of development and engagement around the provision of necessary social and community infrastructure, which needs to be realistic and taking account of the likely availability of funding for such infrastructure, mindful of the broader budgetary and fiscal position of the relevant sponsoring agencies, whether they be the relevant local authority or relevant Government Departments and agencies. </p><p>Furthermore, with respect to particular matters relating to the provision of educational facilities, my Department also issued statutory guidelines in 2008 on the <i>Provision of Schools and the Planning System</i>which is being implemented under a Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Education and Skills and the local government system, in respect of identification and acquisition of sites for new schools. <i></i></p><p>Specifically with respect to the provision of infrastructure, the LAP Guidelines strongly recommend planning authorities use the powers available to them under Section 20 (1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) to ascertain the views of different infrastructure providers, land owners and developers with particular regard to how future development and infrastructure provision, such as local transport, schools, amenities and water services, might be effectively phased and integrated.</p><p>The Guidelines also stress that the results of such statutory engagement with infrastructure providers is a leading influence, in an iterative manner, on the plan - making process, with the practical effect that statutory plans should avoid identifying areas for development where the relevant physical or social infrastructure provider has clearly indicated that investment in essential supporting infrastructure is unlikely to be provided within the lifetime of the plan.</p><p>While keeping the matter under general review, I am satisfied that, in view of the extensive legislative underpinning for LAP and the relatively recent statutory guidance on the matter, the processes for devising and implementing statutory LAPs continue to befit for purpose.</p></reply>

The overall aim of the Directive is to maintain high and good status waters where they exist and to restore waters that do not currently adequately support aquatic ecosystems.  River basin management planning, structured in six -year cycles, is the tool prescribed by the Directive for achieving these aims.   </p>  <p>  The second-cycle River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) for the period up to 2021 is in preparation at the moment, and the draft Pl an is scheduled to be published in the coming months.  A six-month public consultation process will take place in the first half of 2017, and the finalised second-cycle RBMP is due for completion by the end of 2017.  Once finalised, the second-cycle RBMP will be submitted to the European Commission within three months of its publication.     </p>  <p>  There is ongoing north-south cooperation on implementation of the Water Framework Directive.  In the context of the development of the second cycle RBMP for Ireland, it is intended that there will be a single national River Basin District (RBD) resulting from a merger of the Eastern, South Eastern, South Western, Western an d Shannon River Basin Districts that had been provided for in the first cycle RBMP.  In addition, a single administrative area will be established for the purpose of coordinating water management with authorities in Northern Ireland for both   the North Western and Neagh Bann International RBDs.</p></reply>

Annual housing output for 2015 was 12,600 homes, meaning that housing supply must be effectively doubled during the lifetime of the Action Plan.  A number of actions are already being progressed by my Department in conjunction with other Departments and Agencies, local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and the construction industry.  Last week, I announced details of 23 Major Urban Housing Development Sites with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes on existing zoned lands and close to the key areas of demand over the next 3-4 years.  These sites will be highlighted as exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management. </p><p>In order to quickly get these and other key sites moving, a &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) has been established.  Twenty-one local authorities, working in conjunction with housing providers, including private developers, home builders and Approved Housing Bodies, have now submitted proposals for funding which are currently being evaluated.  Successful bid proposals will be announced before the end of 2016. </p><p>Separately, the NTMA and ISIF are currently exploring opportunities to support the delivery of housing-related on-site enabling infrastructure in large-scale priority development areas, with a view to kickstarting the development process. </p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 was published earlier this month and is a legislative priority during the current term.

My Department already has a range of funding programmes that support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to build or acquire properties for social housing use.  For example, the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) operated through my Department currently provides a means whereby properties can be built or bought by AHBs, with the use of private funding, and leased through AHBs and local authorities, for the provision of social housing.  This scheme is underpinned by a lease and other legal agreements which provide that rental payments a   re made by the State over an agreed long-term time period, typically 20 years, in return for which the housing unit is made available for social housing.  </p>  <p>  The Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) provides funding to AHBs for the provision of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing needs such as homeless and older people, people with disabilities, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence.   </p>  <p>  If an AHB is interested in making use of one of these funding programmes, I would advise them to contact the relevant local authority to discuss how   best they can work together and access the relevant funding.</p></reply>

The estimated costs arising would also need to be fully analysed and considered.

There is already a strong pipeline of new social housing delivery projects in place nationally, involving both local authorities and approved housing bodies and that pipeline is being added to through the enhanced targets under Rebuilding Ireland.  My Department will remain engaged with all local authorities to support the increased and accelerated delivery of social housing.  </p><p>In regard to assisting people with building/purchasing their own homes, a standard annuity mortgage is available from local authorities targeted at  lower income first time buyers.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  A local authority mortgage is an annuity mortgage with variable interest rates so repayments can go up and down in line with interest rate changes.  The Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 408 of 2012) prescribe in detail the terms and conditions applicable to local authority housing loans.  Key eligibility criteria provide that a loan applicant must be a first time buyer and must be able to show their local authority that they cannot get a loan from a bank or building society. Also, the gross income (before tax) of a single income household in the previous year must be &euro;50,000 or less and the combined gross income (before tax) of a two - income household in the previous year must be &euro;75,000 or less.</p><p>Another option is the Home Choice Loan, a Government backed mortgage for First Time Buyers.  First time buyers can apply for a Home Choice Loan to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home. Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased. The maximum loan amount is &euro;285,000.  The loan is a normal  capital and interest bearing mortgage which is repaid on a monthly basis.  Home Choice Loan offers one variable interest rate. The rate is currently set at 3.25% variable, APR 3.30%. Further information is available at .</p><p>Serviced sites initiatives have been successful in the past in enabling people with the means to build their own homes, but without access to a suitable site, to meet their housing requirement while also contributing to urban and village rejuvenation. Actions 5.12 and 5.13 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>are aimed at ensuring that a range of demonstration projects and brown field development opportunities are progressed by local authorities as part of their public housing building programmes. The potential of a serviced site programme will be considered in the context of the progression of these actions in tandem with wider land supply actions, such as the commitment set out in Action 3.5 to prepare a National Land Supply Management Strategy.</p></reply>

HAP is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas, with over 14,900 households currently being supported by the scheme and around 10,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to those households.  A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP in each local authority area at the end of September 2016 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:  . </p><p>Rebuilding Ireland commits to accelerating the roll out of the HAP scheme to nine further local authorities by the end of 2016 and the remaining three Dublin local authorities by the end of March 2017, completing the national roll-out of the scheme.  An intensive programme of training for Cavan, Kerry, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils is currently ongoing in preparation for the proposed introduction of the scheme in these areas from 1 December 2016, subject to the necessary regulations being in place.</p><p>The full roll-out of the scheme will be completed by March 2017, with the introduction of HAP to the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown and Fingal County Council. A multi-agency HAP Implementation Dublin Working Group has been established to advise and prepare for the introduction of the scheme to the Dublin region based on experience of the roll-out to date, and the particular pressures and characteristics of the rental market in Dublin.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland also commits that an additional 12,000 households will be supported by HAP in 2016, and a further 15,000 new households in 2017. Reflecting on the current average weekly rate of new  households being supported by the scheme (350 per week over the last three weeks , and 230 per week for the year to date ), I am confident that the 2016 target will be met.</p><p>The Action Plan makes a specific commitment that as part of the accelerated delivery of the scheme, the housing needs of 1,750 homeless households will be met through the Homelessness Pilot of the HAP scheme over 2016 and 2017 . As of 14 November 2016 a total of 594 tenancies had been set up under the pilot scheme this year, exceeding the Rebuilding Ireland target of 550 homeless households to be supported by the scheme in 2016.</p><p>While the level of supply in the rental market is challenging, HAP continues to offer many families stable and supported social housing. The recent increases to maximum rent limits underpinning the HAP scheme, together with the additional flexibility provided to local authorities in operating the scheme locally, mean that HAP can and will continue to offer families ongoing support and access to good quality housing in communities of their choice.</p></reply>

In this regard, two key measures in the Bill propose:</p><p>the introduction of temporary fast-track planning arrangements whereby planning applications for large-scale housing developments (100+ units), including student accommodation developments (200+ units), will be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and determined within the specified maximum timeframe of 25 weeks; and</p><p>the streamlining of timelines, to a maximum of 20 weeks, for presenting and considering local authority own development proposals, including social housing proposals, through the Part 8 process.</p><p>Both of these streamlining measures, in respect of large housing developments and local authority own developments proposals, are intended to provide greater certainty in respect of the timelines for the progression of such housing developments, thereby facilitating the earlier provision of increased housing supply and helping to address the current housing supply shortage situation.</p><p>It is estimated that, from the aggregation of factors arising from measures already taken to reduce housing input costs, including the package of interim measures on housing supply, entitled Stabilising Rents &ndash; Boosting Supply which was<i></i>approved by the Government in November 2015, a decrease in the cost of building new residential units by between &euro;20,000 and &euro;40,000 can be achieved, depending on whether apartments or houses are being constructed.

On 16 December 2014, a statutory direction was issued to all authorities involved in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefiting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through a transfer option.  Local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  It is ultimately up to the household to choose if they wish to be placed on a local authority&rsquo;s transfer list, and I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of this option.  As of the start of November 2016, over 190 households across the country have transferred from the HAP scheme to other forms of social housing support.</p></reply>

This includes undertaking a detailed analysis, in conjunction with the construction sector, to benchmark housing delivery input costs in Ireland, in order to facilitate an increased level of housing output into the future.  A working group, chaired by my Department, will begin work on this task over the coming weeks with representatives from the Construction Industry Council.</p><p>My Department has also input into work led by the Department of Finance in relation to construction costs which was undertaken under the Construction 2020 Strategy.  In addition, costs are examined in the context of proposed legislative changes, particularly in relation to Building Regulations, and a cost benefit analysis and regulatory impact analysis is carried out on any proposed amendments.</p><p>In the context of social housing provision, my Department undertakes analysis in respect of the average costs associated with the delivery of a range of differently sized social housing units, both in terms of construction costs and &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; costs.  These costs are based on an analysis of returned data from local authorities on social housing schemes and this is kept under constant review.</p><p>Further measures taken by my Department to bring down the cost of providing private sector homes include the &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which will provide much-needed enabling infrastructure on key sites to open up lands for development from early 2017 onwards.</p><p>In addition, the NTMA, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), is developing proposals to offer competitive financing on a commercial basis, and in line with ISIF&rsquo;s statutory mandate, to meet other infrastructure requirements on large development sites.</p></reply>

At the present time, the person in question does not have any permission to remain in the State.</p>  <p>  On 8th May 2015, some five months after their permission had expired, the person concerned made an application for further permission to remain in the State.  However, they were informed on 12th July 2016 that they had come to the end of their permission to remain in the State and that they should make arrangements to leave the State.  They were also informed that they were not entitled to Stamp 4 permission to remain in the State.</p>  <p>  Ireland has offered a generous immigration regime to foreign students, not only in allowing them to work to support themselves in their studies, but also in providing ample opportunity for them to obtain academic qualifications that will equip them for their future, whether that is in Ireland or on their return to their home country.  It is up to each student to make the best use of that opportunity.  If their academic achievement is high, then Ireland offers opportunities to students to stay on as graduates, researchers, or high skilled employees.  In other words, student permission gives the person concerned a chance to qualify for an enhanced immigration status on the basis of their academic achievement.  However, student permission is of a temporary and limited nature that is not reckonable for naturalisation purposes and that generally does not allow for family reunification.  Merely spending time in Ireland as a student does not confer entitlement or expectation to remain.</p>  <p>  I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to the document "Guidelines for non-EEA students registered in Ireland before 1 January 2011."  This notice clarifies the position in relation to non-EEA students registered here.  The overall seven year period, which the person in question has now exhausted, provides students with ample opportunity to achieve the sort of qualifications they need to qualify them for an employment permit should they wish to remain in Ireland afterwards.</p>  <p>  If the person concerned leaves the State voluntarily, then it would be open to them to apply for a D reside visa from outside the State.  At that point, any family circumstances would be taken into account along with any other reasons why the person in question believes that they should be granted permission to reside in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  If there are any relevant exceptional circumstances which would justify granting the person concerned permission to remain in the State, they will be taken into account if the person concerned is issued with an intention to deport letter under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established for this purpose.

Vetting checks are conducted by the Garda vetting bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available are taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. </p>  <p>  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.  This is an option that is open to the relevant organisations who seek vetting, including in the education sector. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform that Deputy that I have been advised by the Garda authorities that there is no particular backlog or delay in Garda vetting applications for schools and temporary substitute workers.  At present 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is very largely obviated.</p>  <p>  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system  which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.</p></reply>

I would draw the Deputy's attention to section 4, which addresses the reasonable accommodation needs of people with disabilities.  The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination in a wide range of employment and employment-related areas; these include recruitment and promotion, equal pay, working conditions, training or experience, dismissal and harassment including sexual harassment.  Again, the issue of reasonable accommodation is addressed in sections 3 and 4. </p>  <p>  I cannot provide legal advice by way of replies to parliamentary questions or otherwise interpret the application of these provisions.  However, any person may obtain advice from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission if they feel that they have been discriminated against contrary to equality legislation, including advice on how to take a claim to the Workplace Relations Commission which provides a free and accessible adjudication service.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Louth Division, on the 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 302.  There are also 33 Garda Reserves and 23 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Since its inception, the Policing Authority has been focussing, as a matter of priority, on its functions which have statutory deadlines and reform significance. The Policing Authority has met on several occasions with the Commissioner and her senior team, as a follow up on its consideration of the O&rsquo;Higgins Report and related matters. A number of these meetings have been held in public to reassure the community about the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Areas that have been highlighted in the discussions include: </p>  <p>  -  Implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p>  <p>  -  Review of the Garda Protected Disclosure policy;</p>  <p>  -  Plans to conduct a culture audit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p>  <p>  -  Corporate governance arrangements and management structures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and </p>  <p>  -  Arrangements for training and the professional development of members.</p>  <p>  The Authority has approved a three-year Strategy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which will inform the content of 	the 2017 Policing Plan to be published before the end of the year. It has reviewed and issued recommendations on the Garda Protected Disclosure policy and will also establish a Code of Ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for Garda members.  </p>  <p>  The sections of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 which remain to be commenced contain provisions essentially enabling the Policing Authority to appoint and remove persons from positions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Sections 10, 11 and 13 contain provisions governing the removal of the Garda Commissioner, Deputy Garda Commissioners, Assistant Garda Commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents, including the procedures to be followed before such removal. Section 12 deals with the appointment by the Authority of persons to the ranks of Assistant Garda Commissioner, chief superintendent and superintendent.  Sections 39 to 42 deal with appointments and secondments between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the procedures to deal with disciplinary matters in relation to persons comprehended by those sections. </p>  <p>  The commencement of these sections is dependent on the regulations governing promotion and discipline in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being amended to reflect the envisaged role for the Authority. In accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner and the Authority must be consulted on any proposed changes to these regulations. In addition, the Garda representative bodies must be consulted and that process is well underway.  Work on the preparation of the proposed regulation changes is nearing completion with a view to the appointment and removal functions being transferred to the Authority in the coming weeks and in any case before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to be aware that the establishment of the Policing Authority has no bearing on promotions to the ranks of sergeant and inspector. These continue to be a matter for the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 14 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Promotion) Regulations 2006.</p></reply>

The Directive provides that victims of crime will be able to:</p><p>-  understand and be understood </p><p>-  receive information </p><p>-  be heard</p><p>-  access victim support services </p><p>-  enjoy safeguards in the context of restorative justice services </p><p>-  access protection </p><p>-  enjoy privacy in the context of the criminal proceedings </p><p>-  receive an individual assessment to identify victim&rsquo;s specific protection needs.</p><p>At an operational level arrangements have been put in place by the criminal justice agencies to ensure that the rights conferred by the Directive are provided to victims of crime within existing legislation and on a non-statutory basis. Legislation to introduce the rights provided for in the Directive on a statutory basis is being drafted as a priority and I expect to publish the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill during the current D&aacute;il session. The key arrangements put in place by the criminal justice agencies are set out beneath. </p><p><b>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</b></p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have trained members of all ranks to implement the new policies and procedures that they have put in place to ensure that victims of crime receive an appropriate and consistent response.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner put in place Garda Victim Service Offices across all 28 Garda Divisions following a successful pilot programme. These offices provide additional assistance to that already provided to victims and their families by investigating officers and Family Liaison Officers. Information on services available is provided to all victims and each victim undergoes an individual assessment of needs.</p><p><b>Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)</b></p><p>The Office of the DPP, which is independent in its functions, has also put in place the necessary measures to implement the Directive, together with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who prosecute cases in the District Court on behalf of the DPP. These measures enable victims to receive reasons in the event of a decision not to prosecute and to seek a review of such a decision. </p><p><b>The Courts Service</b></p><p>The Courts Service has arrangements in place to ensure the final decision in a criminal trial and reasons for such a decision, where there is no jury involved, are given to victims. New court facilities built recently have and those planned will have separate areas for victims to reduce the likelihood of contact with accused persons in their case.</p><p><b>Funding</b></p><p>I have secured a &euro;250,000 increase in the funding for 2017 for the victims organisations funded through the Victims of Crime Office in my Department in the recent Estimates process. This should help fund improved and expanded services by organisations working with victims. This is in addition to an extra &euro;250,000 that I secured for 2016. The advertisement announcing the 2017 grant scheme appeared in the newspapers recently and applications are being received in the Victims of Crime Office. Services to victims that received funding in 2016 included helpline services, face to face emotional support, information and court accompaniment to victims and specialist services for those bereaved by homicide, tourist victims, child victims and victims of sexual crime and victims of domestic violence.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. </p>  <p>  This inability to intervene in such matters is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  </p>  <p>  However, I do accept that it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market. Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair. The initial focus of the Working Group is on the factors that are contributing to the cost and availability of motor insurance and identifying what short-term, medium-term and long-term measures can be introduced to help consumers and businesses. However, as some of the factors are common to all insurance lines, it is likely that many of the recommendations being considered will also address the difficulties being experienced in the cost and availability of insurance in other sectors, including the SME sector. </p>  <p>  The Department has received submissions from a number of SME's outlining how the cost of insurance is impacting  them. These submissions have informed and fed into the ongoing work of the Working Group. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that at the end of October 2016, the Working Group provided me with an initial set of emerging recommendations. Since then, the Working Group has been working to finalise the Report and developing an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of agreed priority actions.  The report and action plan will detail any legislative or regulatory changes that may be required and will include a detailed timeline for implementation.</p></reply>

In that regard, section 784A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, provides that income or gains arising while the funds are invested in an ARF are exempt from tax. Withdrawals from an ARF are generally taxable at the owner's marginal rate of tax. ARFs are managed by Qualifying Fund Managers, mainly insurance companies, banks and stockbrokers.  </p>  <p>  Under the Double Taxation Treaty between Ireland and the United Kingdom, in common with double taxation agreements generally, a taxing right in respect of income and capital gains from immovable property is given to the Contracting State (Ireland or the UK as appropriate) in which the property is situated. As there is no specific exemption for ARFs in the treaty, ARFs with investments in UK property are liable to tax in the UK on the income and gains arising from such property. However, Article 14A of the treaty provides an exemption in relation to income and gains derived by a resident of one Contracting State from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State in certain circumstances. This arises where the competent authority of the first State certifies that the income and gains are tax exempt in that State "by reason of the provisions in the laws of that State which afford relief from taxation to charities and superannuation schemes, as such, or to insurance companies in respect of their pension business ".  An ARF must, therefore, be either a superannuation scheme or pension business of an insurance company in order to qualify for the exemption under Article 14A. </p>  <p>  As outlined above, ARFs are not superannuation schemes and, therefore, it is only where they come within the scope of "insurance companies in respect of their pension business" that they are covered by Article 14A. I am advised by Revenue that subsection (5) of section 784A of the TCA 1997 specifically extends the scope of references to the pension business of insurance companies to include ARFs provided by such companies. However, it should be noted that such ARFs are exempt under Article 14A not because they are ARFs, but because they form part of the pension business of such companies. I understand from Revenue that HM Revenue and Customs considered whether they were in a position to extend the benefits of Article 14A to all ARFs, but concluded that as ARFs are not superannuation schemes, per se, they are outside the scope of the treaty other than where they fall within the "insurance company" element referred to above. </p>  <p>  As regards Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs), the 2016 Finance Bill contains provisions to stop PRSAs being used for tax avoidance purposes. The avoidance concerned involved benefits never being taken from a PRSA so that it never "vests" with the result that certain taxes never applied and a more favourable tax treatment was afforded the PRSA assets on the death of the beneficial owner. To counter this avoidance, the Finance Bill provides that where PRSA benefits have not commenced by the date of the owner's 75th birthday (as envisaged by the TCA 1997), such benefits are deemed to commence (i.e. the PRSA is deemed to vest) on that date.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:  </p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  -  be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  -  be without one or both legs;  </p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014. These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Ombudsman has made comments regarding the eligibility criteria of the Disabled Driver and Disabled Passengers Scheme.  The Ombudsman stated that, in his opinion, the criteria were narrowly focused and prescriptive.  The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities. I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria. While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

To do so would consist entirely of deadweight, as individuals who signed contracts to purchase new homes or who drew down the first tranche of their mortgage in respect of a self-build home, in advance of the original announcement did not need the assistance of the State to fund the required deposit. Such individuals made their purchasing decisions on the basis of the information available to them at the time of purchase, and could not have expected a subsequently introduced tax relief to be available to them.</p>  <p>  It is unclear from the Deputy's question as to the precise details of the case concerned.

Following this report, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) appointed Promontory Financial Group to further investigate these allegations.  Promontory's work along with the involvement of the FCA, led RBS last week to announce redress for certain SME customers.</p>  <p>  As I have previously answered, Ulster Bank Ireland Limited undertook an independent review into the relevance of these allegations to its corresponding division, namely the Global Restructuring Group Ireland (GRGI).  On the 19th December 2014, Ulster Bank published the findings of the independent review by Mahon Hayes Curran into practices at GRGI. The investigation found no evidence to support the allegations and suggested that GRGI's driving policy was to manage its customers through the cycle, supporting them where possible to return them to viability.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is the statutory body with responsibility for the investigation of any such allegations in an Irish context and I consider this a matter for the Central Bank.  I am confident that legislative changes since the financial crisis have equipped the Central Bank with an array of investigative, regulatory and enforcement powers to ensure that regulated financial service providers adhere to the requirements of financial services legislation.  These changes include significantly enhanced powers for the Central Bank to gather information under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 which broadened the Banks' information gathering and authorised officer powers.  It is evident that the Central Bank is properly undertaking its enforcement role by the recent sizeable settlements in enforcement cases.</p>  <p>  In addition to this enforcement role, the Deputy may be aware that the Central Bank is proactively regulating the financial system and has issued regulations aimed at protecting SMEs when dealing with regulated and unregulated firms as set out below.  These strengthened regulations include the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation for regulated lenders (other than credit unions) on 1 July 2016 and in the case of credit unions, will come into operation from 1 January 2017.  These revised SME Regulations introduce specific requirements for regulated lenders, including: </p>  <p>  -  Contacting SME borrowers who have been in arrears for 15 working days; </p>  <p>  -  Warning SME borrowers if they are in danger of being classified as not co-operating; and </p>  <p>  -  Expanding the grounds for appeal and setting up an internal appeals panel.</p>  <p>  In relation to unregulated firms, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015. It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the SME Regulations noted above) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about his educational progress I would advise, in the first instance, that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the school&rsquo;s assigned NEPS psychologist.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy or local NEPS office.</p></reply>

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as they operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment.  SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage women to take up apprenticeships in these areas. Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers. 25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development. In recent months, we have seen the first of these new apprenticeships with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship recently commencing. Further new apprenticeships will get underway later this year and early next year. Many of these new programmes are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Accompanying the renewal and expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign. SOLAS will examine how this campaign can assist with promoting apprenticeship to women and to their potential employers.</p></reply>

This decision was extended by the Government to all staff in the education sector ahead of the 2016 General Election.  Therefore the only means by which a teacher who takes up a seat in the Oireachtas can temporarily take leave from their teaching post and subsequently return to it is through taking a career break.</p></reply>

The objective on this visit was to both demonstrate what Ireland is doing in the fields of education and training, and to observe and learn from what is being done in other countries, and to discuss problems arising and how they are being approached.  It was hoped also specifically to offer support to the education and training sector in Palestine, which Ireland is already directly supporting through Irish Aid assistance and capacity building.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this visit to Palestine entailed transit through Israel.  It was natural therefore, as well as courteous, to seek also to discuss these areas with relevant Israeli Ministers.  I found these meetings useful and interesting.  In this regard, no meeting with the Minister to whom the Deputy refers actually took place.</p>  <p>  This visit was arranged with the advice and assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and its diplomatic missions on the ground.  This advice was clearly in favour of meeting Ministers in both jurisdictions, if possible.  Ireland has consistently voiced criticisms of Israel&rsquo;s occupation of Palestinian territory, but the Government does not consider that this should prohibit mutually beneficial relations with Israel in other spheres.  Similar concerns would apply to very many states around the world with whom Ireland has human rights concerns.</p>  <p>  Questions relating to Ireland&rsquo;s relations with Israel, or Israeli Ministers, should be taken up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></reply>

The increased target of 47,000 new social housing units by 2021 is backed up by &euro;5.35 billion funding.  My Department is engaged on an ongoing basis with all local authorities concerning their plans and programmes for the delivery of those targets.  I have met directly with the local authority chief executives and assured them that funding is available to advance new projects and to urge the swiftest possible progress on their overall programme of projects.</p>  <p>  Our efforts to significantly ramp up social housing construction nationally are taking effect.  In 2015, only 74 units were constructed by local authorities.  In 2016, circa 1,400 units will start or have already started on site.  More than 3,000 additional units will start on site in 2017.  The continuous contact between my Department and all local authorities is focused on both the existing projects and on bringing forward additional, new proposals through a range of delivery means.  This contact also includes a focus on housing acquisitions, which are providing a strong and immediate stream of delivery.  Over 1,000 new social homes were delivered last year through acquisitions and I anticipate a significant programme again this year.  Local authorities and AHBs are also undertaking new turnkey construction projects with private developers.</p>  <p>  The targets for social housing under Rebuilding Ireland represent a substantial increase over previous targets.  While a challenge for all of us who are involved in their delivery, I am confident that the range of measures provided for in Rebuilding Ireland provide a solid basis for the full achievement of our targets.</p></reply>

The Guidelines also aim at ensuring that sites being developed for rural housing are suitable with regard to access and wastewater disposal , and also from landscape and design perspectives.</p><p>It is a matter for individual planning authorities to prepare their development plans and the policies contained within such plans, taking account of local and varying geographical and landscape circumstances, as well as the approaches set out under the Guidelines in relation to rural generated housing.

I intend to keep the Guidelines under review, particularly in view of the commitments in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland, which aim to accelerate the delivery of housing in order to address the current housing supply shortage and the projected housing needs over the coming years.  The Action Plan indicates that achieving this aim will contribute to wider objectives, including the need to support sustainable urban and rural development and communities.</p></reply>

Under the Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, a total of 1,500 rapid-build units will be delivered by 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working closely with the four Dublin local authorities in relation to the rapid delivery programme.  To date, 22 rapid build units have already been delivered and are occupied and by end year a total of 350 rapid-build homes will be advancing through various stages of delivery, including construction.  A further 650 rapid-build homes will be advanced in 2017, with another 500 units to be delivered in 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition to working with the four Dublin local authorities on their rapid delivery programmes, my Department is also encouraging other local authorities with urgent housing needs to advance a range of rapid delivery projects so as to ensure the delivery of units in the quickest manner possible.</p>  <p>  Of particular note is the establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement, which is currently at the final stages of tender evaluation.  The framework will be in place next month and will mean that local authorities across the country will be able to run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid build projects to site more efficiently and effectively.</p></reply>

Rebuilding Ireland takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market by including actions to streamline the planning system, remove infrastructure blockages and support the delivery of affordable housing.  These measures should help make new developments economically viable in areas where supply constraints and price pressures are particularly acute.</p>  <p>  Only last week, I announced details of 23 Major Urban Housing Development Sites with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes on existing zoned lands and close to the key areas of demand over the next three to four years.  These sites will be highlighted as exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management.</p>  <p>  In order to quickly get these and other key sites moving, a &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) has been established.  Twenty-one local authorities, working in conjunction with housing providers, submitted proposals for funding which are currently being evaluated.  Successful bid proposals will be announced in December.</p>  <p>  Separately, the NTMA and ISIF are currently exploring opportunities to support the delivery of housing-related on-site enabling infrastructure in large-scale priority development areas with a view to kick starting the development process.</p>  <p>  Given the particular challenge faced by first-time buyers in accessing the housing market, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, recently announced a Help-to-Buy initiative as part of Budget 2017.  The Help-to-Buy initiative has been designed to complement the structural measures announced in Rebuilding Ireland; by providing immediate and targeted support for first-time buyers of new homes in meeting their deposit requirements, greater certainty regarding the pool of available purchasers is provided to the house-building sector, encouraging the construction of new housing units.</p>  <p>  The combined effect of these, and other actions, under the Plan, will  help reduce costs and deliver more housing at affordable prices, where it is greatly needed.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland, published in July 2016, further reinforces the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the area of urban regeneration.</p><p>In this context, the Government  launched the Town and Village Renewal Scheme last August with an allocation of &euro;10 million in funding for the year.  A sum of &euro;380,000 was made available to each of the 26 counties for 2016 under this initial phase of the scheme.  Local Authorities, in conjunction with local communities and businesses, were each invited to submit up to eight proposals by the end of September for approval.  Following an assessment of the proposals received, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, announced (on 4 November) details of 172 towns and villages which will benefit from the funding available under this year's Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  The full list of towns benefitting under the scheme is available on the website of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p><p>Increased funding of &euro;12 million has been provided in Budget 2017 to enhance this scheme with a view to increasing the attractiveness and sustainability of our towns and villages as places in which to live and work.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to examining a series of further initiatives, such as:</p><p>- the introduction of a similar scheme to the &lsquo;Living City Initiative&rsquo; to regenerate urban centres and villages throughout Ireland (Year 1 action),</p><p>- examining the scope to reform the Derelict Sites Act to tackle the under-use and hoarding of derelict land by the State, semi-State and private sectors (Year 1 action),</p><p>- the establishment of a National Register of Derelict Sites, in addition to the new vacant site levy, to bring vacant and under-utilised sites into beneficial use for housing and urban regeneration purposes (Year 2 action),</p><p>- the mandating of local authorities with better land management powers, including the possibility of additional CPO capabilities (Year 2 action), and</p><p>- various other measures, which were further developed under the Rebuilding Ireland, Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<i>,</i>and especially those under Pillar 5 aimed at re-using vacant housing stock, such as the:</p><blockquote>- Repair and Lease Initiative (&euro;140 million funding over five years)<br /><br />- Buy and Repair Initiative (&euro;25 million funding for 2017)<br /><br />- purchase by the Housing Agency of vacant buy-to-let properties on the portfolios of financial institutions and investors (&euro;70 million funding for 2016).</blockquote><p>To drive forward these and other considerations, a Working Group, chaired by my colleague, the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal, and comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and other relevant bodies, has been established and will bring forward proposals for new urban regeneration measures as early as possible.  It is intended that the new measures will complement the existing regeneration programme under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Capital Programme, as well as other social regeneration initiatives already under way.</p><p>Having held its inaugural meeting in mid-June, the Working Group has met on three occasions and is due to meet again in the coming weeks to consider issues and emerging proposals.</p></reply>

The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  These limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 .</p><p>I am aware of the difficulties experienced by some households in purchasing their own home where they are not eligible for social housing support on income grounds.  It may be possible for such households to avail of a mortgage from a local authority which is targeted at lower income first- time buyers who can demonstrate that they are unable to get a loan from a building society or bank.  A loan can be up to 97% of the price of the property, subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 408 of 2012), which prescribe a maximum annual gross income threshold of &euro;50,000 for a single person household or a combined annual gross income of &euro;75,000 for a two person household. The Regulations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>Another option is the Home Choice Loan, a Government backed mortgage for first time buyers.  The Home Choice Loan is available through authorised mortgage brokers and can be used to provide up to 92% of the market value of the property being purchased, up to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  A new or second hand property may be purchased under the scheme. Further information is available at:<i></i></p><p>.</p></reply>

The &euro;200m Fund will be composed of an Exchequer allocation of &euro;150 million, matched by a &euro;50 million contribution from participating local authorities.  </p>  <p>  A call for proposals under the fund was issued to local authorities on 26 August 2016, with a closing date for receipt of proposals of 14 October.  It was open to all local authorities to apply, with funding to be allocated on the basis of a competitive bid process.  21 local authorities have submitted a total of 74 project applications relating to specific sites or development land areas.  Louth County Council submitted a proposal in relation to Northern Environs, Drogheda which includes the Port Access Northern Cross Route. </p>  <p>  The overall total cost of the 74 funding bid applications is approximately &euro;800m, with funding of some &euro;600m being sought from the Exchequer and local authorities agreeing to fund approximately &euro;200m as part of their matching fund requirements.  It will not be possible to approve all applications, given the scale and value of applications received. </p>  <p>  The viability of the applications is currently being examined in detail against the assessment criteria set out in the Call for Proposals, with a focus on the level of funding required and what it might leverage, the number of housing units that could be delivered, their strategic location and speed of delivery, and affordability levels of a proportion of the homes. </p>  <p>  In light of the different financial assessments required for the different scales of proposals under the Public Spending Code, there will be two phases of announcements.  I intend to make initial announcements for successful smaller-scale projects in mid-December and a second phase announcement by end March 2017 for those project bids requiring more detailed financial appraisals.   </p></reply>

Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them tackle barriers to employment and to assist them in finding full-time sustainable jobs.  Each participant is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants receive the JobPath service for a period of 12 months (which can be extended by up to six months to facilitate the jobseeker completing training programmes) or until such time as they find employment whichever is the sooner.  If the jobseeker secures employment during this period they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment</p>  <p>  T&Uacute;S is a community work placement initiative providing short-term working opportunities for jobseekers as a stepping stone back to full-time employment.  T&Uacute;S placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Unemployed people do not apply to participate in T&Uacute;S.  Eligible people are selected for T&Uacute;S by my Department. In general, in order to manage the allocation of places effectively, jobseekers cannot participate in two schemes simultaneously.  This restriction applies to T&Uacute;S, JobPath and other schemes.  However, if a person has completed their engagement with the one service and continues to be unemployed, participation on other schemes remains an option that can be considered for that person subject to an assessment by a departmental case officer.</p>  <p>  Jobseekers, who are selected for JobPath, are invited to attend an initial information session that is jointly hosted by my Department and the JobPath company and at which the jobseekers' rights and responsibilities are explained.  I have asked my officials to arrange for information on referrals to T&Uacute;S (as well as other scheme such as Community Employment and Gateway) to be provided at future sessions.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  One of the conditions of the State pension (contributory) is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.</p>  <p>  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim. </p>  <p>  The State assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. </p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme in 1994, there was no provision for the recognition of periods of homemaking.  This scheme introduced such recognition of periods going forward from that date, but had it been backdated, the costs would have been very considerable.  I am advised that if the Homemakers scheme was to be backdated to all dates prior to 1994, for payments from January 2017, the net cost to the Exchequer could be expected to amount to approximately &euro;290 million in 2017, and this annual cost would rise at a faster rate than the overall cost of State pensions. </p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of next year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Government is committed to working constructively with the new Administration when it assumes its responsibilities on January 20th.  In the meantime, we will avail of all opportunities during the transition period to sensitise the incoming Administration to our concerns on immigration related matters.  The Government continues to believe that progress on this issue will also require intensive work on a bi-partisan basis in both Houses of Congress, an approach we will continue to take once the new Congress takes office in the New Year.</p>  <p>  I most recently raised the question of immigration reform, including relief for undocumented Irish citizens in the United States, during my meeting with US Secretary of State, Mr John Kerry, on 30 October. While Secretary of State Kerry does not carry policy responsibility for immigration reform, he was personally very sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented Irish and was hopeful that progress could be made in the future.</p>  <p>  I also availed of my visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly in September to meet Irish community leaders in the United States, to discuss with them the prospects for achieving immigration reform and to reassure them of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the issue.  In addition, Minister of State McHugh met representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, representing a broad group of Irish centres across the United States, in New York on 20 September.  That meeting was also attended by Senator Billy Lawless of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  The Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Washington continue to work closely with Irish American community leaders in actively pursuing all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform.  There is little prospect of the comprehensive reform that we seek being achieved within the lifetime of the outgoing Congress and the current policy platform of the Trump campaign would not suggest that it will be an immediate priority for the incoming Administration. Nevertheless, our Ambassador and Embassy staff in Washington DC are working with their contacts on both sides of the political aisle to assess the basis for a renewed initiative once a new Administration and Congress have been established in Washington DC. </p></reply>

The attendance and participation by business figures from Northern Ireland at the recent All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit, for instance, was very welcome, and it is clear from our contacts that the Northern Ireland business community recognises how much the economies North and South can gain from co-operation.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the Strategy will include agreed actions in relation to improving the health of travellers.

The Act sets out the primary and community health services made available, free of charge, to qualifying women.  The health services included in the legislation are: a general practitioner service; prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; home nursing; home support; chiropody; physiotherapy; and counselling services. In addition, the prescription fee is not be payable for all medicines, medical devices or other medical products that are reimbursed by the community drug schemes.  A specific card has been issued to the qualifying women so that they can access the health services they require without charge, as set out in the Act.  There are no proposals at present to extend automatic eligibility to other victims of institutional abuse.</p>  <p>  Caranua is an organisation which offers support, information, advice and advocacy to survivors.  For example they will help members get the services they are entitled to as citizens, and improve access to those services.  They can also pay for services so that each member has the supports needed, and can give grants to individuals to source services themselves.  The areas Caranua provide help with will depend on the needs and circumstances of each individual.</p>  <p>  However, where there are people with medical needs it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  It is clear greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 113,210 as of 1 November this year. </p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public;</p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older weighing less than 25kg.  In March of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: . </p><p>The HSE will enter into negotiations with the manufacturer in an effort to secure significant price reductions for Kalydeco. </p><p>The HSE will consider the outcome of these engagements, together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement.  This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>As you will appreciate, I cannot comment on the case of any individual, or intervene in individual patient cases.</p></reply>

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  More recently, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population was conducted by the Health Research Board (HRB) on behalf of the Department.  This review was published by the HRB in June 2015.  The HRB found no definitive evidence that community water fluoridation is associated with negative health effects.  A research project "Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth" (FACCT) is being conducted by UCC and supported by the HSE.  Preliminary results indicate that children's oral health has been improving, fluoridated communities have lower levels of dental caries. </p>  <p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  It has already considered the specific issues raised by the Deputy and advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, is a safe and effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  Given that the policy has already been reviewed and is under constant review, a further public consultation is not considered necessary.  Fluoridation policy is provided for in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.  There are no plans to consider a plebiscite.</p></reply>

Currently a National Steering Group, chaired by the Health Service Executive (HSE) Head of Disability Reform, is considering feedback on a draft implementation framework which was circulated for consultation to wider stakeholder interest groups.  The revised framework will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of Neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level from a non-acute perspective.  Proposals for specialised residential services for people with acquired brain injury will be considered in the broader context of the finalisation of the implementation framework for neuro-rehabilitation services.</p>  <p>  With regard to this specific business proposal, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Drug and Alcohol Task Forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem in their areas and coordinating action at local level, so that there is a targeted response to the problem of substance misuse in local communities. </p>  <p>  Following a review of Task Forces completed in 2012, increased responsibilities were given to Drug and Alcohol Task Forces to address the alcohol problem.  In light of their expanded role, a substance misuse measure was included in the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2014 and the Task Forces were identified as the key structures through which the measure would be implemented.  In excess of &euro;930,000 in additional funding was recommended for disbursement to Drug and Alcohol Task Forces from the Dormant Accounts Fund for substance misuse initiatives, including over &euro;35,800 for the Tallaght Drug and Alcohol Task Force.  The grants to Task Forces were provided from the Dormant Accounts Fund on a once-off basis to undertake a range of coordinated activities aimed at raising awareness of drug and alcohol-related harm in local communities in line with the National Drugs Strategy.  There are no further grants available  for this purpose under this round of funding. </p>  <p>  In addition, a number of Task Forces, including Tallaght Drug and Alcohol Task Force, have benefitted from training provided by the Alcohol Forum for the development of local alcohol action plans. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health will shortly be inviting Task Forces to submit recommendations for the funding of projects from the Drugs Initiative budget in 2017.  It is a matter for Task Forces to ensure that their budget is effectively deployed to address current priorities and locally identified needs.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public;</p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older weighing less than 25kg.  In March of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: <i>. </i></p><p>The HSE will enter into negotiations with the manufacturer in an effort to secure significant price reductions for Kalydeco. </p><p>The HSE will consider the outcome of these engagements together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement.  This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>As you will appreciate, I cannot comment on the case of any individual, or intervene in individual patient cases.</p></reply>

There has been significant progress in terms of responses from all stakeholders across a number of areas, with EU measures, initiatives by processors and a new flexible loan fund for dairy and other farmers announced in Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  On the market front, since taking office I have led trade missions to Asia and to North Africa, with a view to increasing the profile of Ireland as a producer of quality food products, particularly dairy products. This work on market diversification is a critically important element in mitigating market volatility and is particularly important in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  On-going efforts within industry to move dairy production up the value chain wherever possible are also critically important and continue to be supported by Government. These efforts are supported by investment by my Department and its agencies in research and innovation. By providing financial support for Teagasc, ICBF and Animal Health Ireland, and for knowledge transfer groups, we continually invest in the provision of advice and education to farmers, which facilitates technology adoption and improves profitability at farm level. My Department is also providing support for investment at farm level through the TAMS scheme.</p>  <p>  The Dairy Quality Assurance Scheme is also critically important in developing a unique selling point for Irish dairy products on EU and international markets. Dairy processors make a substantial contribution to cover some of the costs of audits under the scheme, but of course the question of price incentives for participation is a matter for the industry.</p>  <p>  Where appropriate, we must continue to focus on appropriate national and EU measures that can play a role in supporting the sector. It is vital that we continue to work closely with the Commission and all other key stakeholders in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Commission, in many instances based on suggestions from Ireland and other like minded Member States, has already deployed a range of market supports including intervention and Aids to Private Storage, and a financial package of &euro;500 million for liquidity assistance was agreed at the Agriculture council in September 2016, with Ireland topping up its allocation to provide a total assistance package of approaching &euro;27M to Irish farmers in late 2015 and early 2016.</p>  <p>  The Commission also announced a further &euro;500m support package for EU farmers in July 2016. The first &euro;150m was reserved for an EU-wide scheme compensating farmers who reduce their milk output over certain reference periods towards the end of 2016. This was very well subscribed to in Ireland and, should the commitments for reduction be adhered to, will be worth over &euro;10M to Irish dairy farmers in 2017.</p>  <p>  For the other element of the Commission package, &euro;350m is set aside for Member State initiatives with fixed allocations per MS. Ireland&rsquo;s allocation under this scheme is &euro;11m. I have decided to provide an additional &euro;13 million national aid in that in order to optimise the effectiveness of this measure and to use it to support  the development of a &euro;150 million fund for low interest loans for farmers.</p>  <p>  A further measure that has assisted in reducing the burden on all farmers, including those in the dairy sector, was the negotiation and agreement of advanced payments for the Basic Payment and the RDP schemes, allowing us to pay out 70% and 85% respectively from 16th October.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work closely with the dairy sector, with EU colleagues and International counterparts to ensure the development and maintenance of a sustainable dairy sector in Cavan, Monaghan and elsewhere.</p></reply>

My Department continues to engage with stakeholders, including circus groups, animal welfare organisations, in relation to the welfare of wild animals in circuses.

The reason for the reduction is attributable to two factors. The first is that the Department, under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme rules, pays on the lesser of the area claimed and the area of the claim as digitised by the Department. In addition the area of biodiversity enhancement is limited to 15% of the area determined for payment.  When the necessary adjustments were made in accordance with the Scheme rules this resulted in a slightly reduced payable area to that claimed on behalf of the person named.</p></reply>

It gives a comprehensive account of all the work by my Department to date to try to curtail and eradicate the disease on a national basis and the findings from each of the targeted and systematic surveys undertaken from 2012 to 2016. The website also provides information on the Reconstitution Scheme (Chalara Ash Dieback) which is available to assist owners of forests planted under the Afforestation Scheme which have suffered from the disease to restore those forests, as well as information on research projects into the control and management of the disease, in particular projects to identify trees that show strong tolerance and or resistance to the disease. There is also a national distribution map and summary table of all confirmed findings up to the second quarter of 2016 (i.e. 30 June this year). This table and map will be updated with the figures for third quarter of 2016 in the coming days.</p>  <p>  To summarise the current situation and to speak to the long term outlook, at this juncture it is important to note that notwithstanding the positive effects at local level of the eradication actions undertaken to date, both by affected landowners supported by the Reconstitution Scheme or directly by the Department itself, the annual systematic surveys and targeted surveys as well as follow up inspections by Department Inspectors have indicated year on year that there is a continuing rise in the number and geographic distribution of confirmed findings nationally. By June of this year, at a time when the targeted and systematic summer surveys were still underway, the initial results were already such as to confirm the presence to a greater or lesser extent of the disease in all 26 counties.</p>  <p>  Another factor is that initially the findings were in imported ash trees. Later  the disease was found  in native hedgerows beside infected imported ash trees. The Department is now finding the disease in native hedgerows where there is no obvious introduced source of infection nearby. In addition over half the recent findings in forest plantations are in ash trees of native Irish origin. It is also worth noting that in  Britain the disease has spread quickly and widely in the natural environment over the same time period.</p>  <p>  As already noted, the Department is actively supporting a number of research projects into disease, in particular projects with a key long-term focus of developing an ash tree breeding programme to identify trees that show strong tolerance and or resistance to the disease and the genetic basis for tolerance. It is through such programmes that a long term strategy for ash can be identified and supported.</p></reply>

The Department will endeavour to issue a more comprehensive reply within 20 working days thereafter. Receipt of all reports successfully submitted using the TreeCheck App are also automatically acknowledged.</p><p>The time taken to complete field investigations and testing can vary greatly depending on the individual circumstances of the case reported. The time taken to complete this work and inform the forest owner of the outcome is dependent on the following factors:</p><p>- the level of detail initially supplied by a reporting party;</p><p>- assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors as to whether ash dieback disease is actually involved and an evaluation of the potential risk associated with the report;</p><p>- the need in terms of the efficient and prudent use of public resources to schedule follow-up visits on such reports with other already planned survey work or inspections, and</p><p>- the need for both the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and its laboratory scientists to prioritise different bodies of work at different times of the year.</p><p>Depending on the above factors, the time taken to report the final outcome to forest owners could be anything between three weeks and three months. </p><p>In terms of calculating the average time taken to reply to reported cases it is not practical to do so given that there are now 255 confirmed cases of ash dieback disease in forest plantations.</p><p>The number of cases that would have to be revisited to calculate this figure is much greater than this figure if sites with negative test results are taken into account. Furthermore, an average figure would be a poor indicator of how long an individual forest owner could expect to wait for a reply from the Department given the significant range that exists between the shortest response time and the longest.</p></reply>

More recently, the future of the CAP was discussed over lunch at this week's Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels. </p>  <p>  This debate is still in its very early stages.  The discussions so far have been very preliminary and exploratory in nature.  Commissioner Hogan has indicated his intention to undertake a wide public consultation in the first half of 2017, following which he will table a communication that will address Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's commitment to modernise and simplify the CAP. </p>  <p>  I am very much of the view that the CAP is a progressive policy that can make a critical contribution to addressing the strategic challenges faced not only by the European agricultural sector in the coming years, but also those facing the EU itself.  One of the key challenges will be to facilitate an increase in food production by up to 70% by 2050 in order to meet the requirements of a growing global population, while doing so in an environmentally sustainable way that also facilitates adaptation to climate change.  The CAP has been increasingly effective in this regard in recent years as it has evolved and responded to the consumer and environmental demands placed upon it, while at the same time helping farmers to deal with price and income volatility.  I will be working to ensure that it continues to do so, and to ensure that it provides a solid and effective foundation for the development of the sector into the future. </p></reply>

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p><p>  In July this year, I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016.  Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well. I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year.</p><p>  Environmental sustainability is at the heart of Food Wise, which states that &ldquo;environmental protection and economic competitiveness are equal and complementary: one cannot be achieved at the expense of the other&rdquo;.  An Environmental Sustainability Subgroup was established under the auspices of HLIC to monitor and drive the sustainability actions outlined in Food Wise 2025.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s whole of Government approach to sustainability includes development of coherent and cost-effective policies to meet the twin challenges of sustainable food production and climate change in the agriculture and land use sector.  The EPA report will help to inform the development of coherent and cost-effective policies to meet these challenges.  The national policy position is based on an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  Officials from my Department work very closely with other Departments and in particular, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment which is the lead in this area.</p><p>  Through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the application of emerging scientific knowledge, Ireland is taking the necessary steps towards addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions in the Irish agriculture sector.  The Rural Development Programme, worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years, is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including knowledge transfer programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers.</p><p>  My Department is also contributing to the National Mitigation Plan, which is being prepared under the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  The work on the national plan is overseen by Government through a hierarchy of committees and sub-groups, with independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council.  These committees and groups include the Cabinet Committee and the Senior Officials' Group on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, a Technical Research and Modelling Group and a Domestic Climate Finance Group.</p><p>  DAFM is a key stakeholder in the implementation of the National Regulations referred to as the Nitrates or the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) Regulations.  These regulations protect water through the implementation of specific controls and are aimed at minimising the loss of Nutrients from Agriculture.  Substantial investments has been made both by my Department and the farming community to implement the GAP measures under the Nitrates Action Programme since their introduction in 2006.  Additionally, under our Agri-environment scheme, GLAS, farmers in areas of high water status and vulnerable water bodies have priority entry to the scheme whilst measures such as 'Fencing of Watercourses' within the scheme are designed specifically to enhance water quality.  The scheme is therefore very much targeted at improving water quality and this objective is supported by both the Knowledge Transfer and the Targetted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes. </p><p>The effectiveness of the Nitrates regulations is monitored by the Agricultural Catchments Programme.  This is an integrated research/advisory programme established in 2008 with over 300 participating farmers in six catchments, funded by my Department.  The Nitrates Regulations provide a considerable environmental baseline which all Irish farmers must achieve.  The next review of these regulations will take place in 2017.</p><p>  With regard to the economic viability of farms outlined in the EPA report, this analysis is based on research by my Department and Teagasc.  The overarching emphasis of Food Wise is to support increased competitiveness and profitability on farms with a view to delivering sustainable growth.  In that regard the three pillar strategy I announced as part of the recent Budget - comprising payments, agri-taxation measures and the innovative Agri Cashflow Support Loan Fund - is designed to alleviate the difficulties caused to farmers by current market difficulties and the uncertainty engendered by the UK decision to leave the EU, and to provide them with longer-term financial stability.</p></reply>

It is therefore proposing that the application of the active farmer definition should be optional for Member States.</p>  <p>  From Ireland's perspective, we are very much in agreement with the Commission's view.  Extensive checks have been carried out in my Department, involving all 132,000 farmers, and I can confirm that no farmer in 2015 was excluded from receiving the Basic Payment Scheme as a consequence of failing the active farmer criteria.  It is our understanding that other Member States had similar results, despite extensive and costly administrative checks.  On this basis, Ireland is very supportive of the proposal to make the application of the active farmer optional for Member States.</p></reply>

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)statistics, published in September 2016, illustrate Ireland&rsquo;s current progress towards meeting EU waste targets including WEEE. The most recent WEEE statistics are with respect to 2014 and demonstrate that 7.2 kg of household WEEE was collected per person in Ireland, compared to the EU target of 4 kg per person, and that Ireland is also meeting recovery rates of 80% and 90% across different recycling processes. This information is available on the EPA&rsquo;s website .</p><p>These statistics are tangible proof of the positive response to the implementation of the WEEE directive in Ireland. Since the introduction of the Irish WEEE legislation, some 100 million waste electrical items have been collected and over 300,000 tonnes of WEEE diverted from landfill. The Irish public have supported the WEEE system and have fully utilised the network of free collection facilities and take-back options available to them. In so doing, they have played an important role in eradicating the visible blight on our countryside and towns caused by waste fridges and washing machines and other electro-scrap.</p><p>More than 300 people are employed in Ireland in direct connection with WEEE collection, recycling and treatment activity and 65% of all WEEE collected in Ireland is recycled by treatment facilities in Ireland. The introduction of the WEELABEX requirements into Irish WEEE legislation requires producers with obligations in Ireland to work with recyclers that are certified to the highest standard in the WEEE industry. This has had the effect of raising standards in the WEEE system in Ireland generally with domestic processing plants for small mixed WEEE, lamp recycling and television and monitor recycling in operation all of which have achieved WEELABEX certification.</p><p>While repair and re-use of WEEE is already well developed in Ireland, particularly in the social economy sector, the key to re-use organisations developing further is access to quality product, a fact acknowledged in the Irish WEEE legislation. Our legislation provides for such access in a co-ordinated and efficient manner for approved re-use organisations, who under our domestic WEEE Regulations now have a legal right to access WEEE from producer&rsquo;s designated collection hubs.</p><p>There are a number of key social, economic and environmental benefits to be gained from the development of a strong re-use marketplace in Ireland and re-use of WEEE is consistent with EU and Irish strategies, policies and directives towards a more sustainable future and circular economy. I am satisfied that we have created the appropriate regulatory environment  to facilitate WEEE re-use and look forward to working with all stakeholders who wish  to play a full and active role in realising the potential of this market.</p></reply>

The most recent rounds of the programme were in 2012, 2014 and 2015.</p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the 2017 Estimates discussions, a total of &euro;52 m has been provided for sports capital projects. This will meet all existing commitments under previous rounds of the Sports Capital and Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, and also allow for a new round of the of the Sports Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  The new round will be open for applications by January at the latest. The new Programme will include a revised online portal which will make the process more user-friendly. Other supports will include a comprehensive written guide and video guides. Based on previous rounds of the programme, the assessment process takes a number of months to complete so I expect that actual final grant allocations will be announced some time during Summer 2017. All other relevant details of the new round will be announced shortly including the relevant closing dates.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p><p>The extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the recession meant that the position in relation to Specific and Strategic grants had to be reviewed in 2013.  Because of the cuts, expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to maintain the regional and local road network adequately.  For this reason the then Minister informed Government in February 2013 that given the impact of the expenditure cuts on maintenance/renewal of roads the decision had to be made to prioritise expenditure on the protection of the existing network and to curtail road improvement grants with effect from 2014.</p><p>Since then the main focus of the grant programme has been on maintenance/renewal including bridge rehabilitation.  In this context my Department is not operating a general application process for Specific and Strategic grants at present.</p><p>  Where funding is being provided for Specific Grant type projects, it is primarily to meet existing commitments, address important safety issues and progress projects included in the Capital Investment Plan.  While 2017 will see a modest increase in funding for regional and local roads, it will still take some years for funding to reach &quot;steady state&quot; levels and the main focus in 2017 will continue to be on maintenance and renewal.  It is expected the 2017 allocations will be announced early in the new year.</p><p>  It is open to Councils to fund road improvement projects from their own resources.  The purpose of Exchequer funding is to supplement the own resources of local authorities, not to meet the full cost of schemes.</p></reply>

The difficulties of taxi and hackney operators in obtaining insurance have been highlighted to the task force by my Department and the National Transport Authority (NTA).  I am advised that the NTA has also had a bi-lateral meeting with the Department of Finance to apprise them on the situation pertaining to small public service vehicle (SPSV) licence holders in relation to both the availability and cost of SPSV insurance.

That is why I am making sure that I am in possession of all the detail of how Brexit impacts on each and every sector and company type &ndash; be they micro, small, medium, or even larger companies in some instances - before I finalise my proposals or make any announcements about specific measures.</p>  <p>  My Officials have also engaged with the European Commission to gain clarification on, and a full understanding of, the scope of EU State Aid rules that currently apply.  The Commission is also aware from our contacts with them that Ireland, above all other Member States, stands to be uniquely impacted by Brexit.</p>  <p>  In order to build further on the foregoing, my Department is currently scoping out various possible responses to the short term currency challenge and I expect to be in a position to announce more detail, based on actual company needs, shortly.  Any new initiative must be tailored, targeted and evidence-based in order for our SMEs to receive the maximum support possible, and in the sectors most needed.</p>  <p>  From the strategic perspective, Enterprise Ireland, an Agency under my remit, is assisting companies to maintain and grow UK exports and extend their international reach, as well as helping companies to enhance their competitiveness.  In addition, the Local Enterprise Offices, also under my remit, are working closely with those clients likely to be impacted by Brexit.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am also aware that my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Michael Creed TD, and Agencies under his remit, are equally engaged in monitoring the impacts of Brexit on all relevant sectors, including the mushroom sector, and is drawing the attention of all firms to supports being provided to the industry through national and EU Schemes.</p></reply>

As part of the organisation&rsquo;s resource plan, Enterprise Ireland launched a Voluntary Leaving Programme in November 2014, which closed in January 2015.  Fifty-one staff availed of the Voluntary Leaving Programme in 2015 and 2016.  The reform agenda included an ongoing process to analyse the skills and capabilities of the organisation.  Recruitment has been ongoing within the agency to address critical gaps in the management structure and current skill gaps in emerging and future sectors to reflect the needs of Irish industry.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I secured additional pay monies which will provide for 50+ new posts for the Department and its agencies to respond to Brexit and to work with companies to help them respond to the challenges and opportunities.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a critical contribution to make in my Department&rsquo;s overall strategic response to Brexit.  Therefore, Enterprise Ireland will create 39 new posts in 2017 in targeted overseas markets including in the UK and also in Dublin, to prepare companies at home and in market to manage the challenges that arise as a result of Brexit.  This immediate need is aligned with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing strategic objective to diversify Ireland&rsquo;s export trade by supporting clients to continue to sustain and win new business in existing markets while exploring opportunities in new markets.</p>  <p>  New posts will be created in a number of overseas markets where Enterprise Ireland and their client companies see strategic opportunities.  It will be hugely important to intensify export growth to other markets, to reduce reliance on the UK, re-orienting companies towards North America, Canada, Asia and the Middle-East.  On foot of 2015 export figures, there is immediate opportunity and potential for strengthening our foothold in existing established markets and for diversified export growth.  Last year sales to North American grew by 27%, Northern Europe by 8% and Asia-PAC by 11%.</p>  <p>  The additional staff placed in the UK will provide market expertise in support of clients dependent on the UK market, to help them sustain existing sales and to win new business.  Some 1500 Enterprise Ireland client companies have recorded exports to the UK and it will remain a priority market for many Irish exporters, particularly first-time exporters.</p>  <p>  In relation to additional staff in Dublin, the experience of the Department, through Enterprise Ireland, is that those clients who are more prepared before entering the market and engaging with in-market Enterprise Ireland teams, have a greater chance of sustained success.  To maintain and grow market share in the UK and broaden the global exporting figures, companies need to be more competitive and innovative.  For Enterprise Ireland, that means proactive engagement with clients in delivering their suite of programmes, such as LEAN, innovation and R&amp;D projects, management and leadership capability as well as sales and marketing and export diversification strategies.  This suite of supports will help companies reduce supply-chain costs and increase efficiencies as a means of improving operating margins, building market share and creating new market opportunities.</p>  <p>  Enhancing EI&rsquo;s Irish based team will increase client preparedness before they enter the market and ensure that the resources in market are being used strategically and to best effect.</p>  <p>  Other key elements of the 2017 Enterprise Ireland strategy include an enhanced programme of trade and investment missions and other trade promotional events and the rollout of EI&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Global Ambition Campaign&rsquo; which will promote Irish companies and their products and services to international buyers.</p></reply>

In today&rsquo;s interconnected world, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policies aim to build resilience into our economy &ndash; by strengthening the capabilities of our enterprises, diversifying export markets and source markets for investment and by maintaining our focus on Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness. Enterprise 2025, our agreed national enterprise policy, was developed in the context of ongoing global uncertainties.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that the UK referendum result has created a high degree of uncertainty and, in that context, it can be expected that many, fluctuating macro-economic, trade and employment forecasts will be produced between now and the UK leaving the European Union. </p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 provides a robust framework that remains valid and sets out an ambitious policy approach. That ambition must be maintained despite any turbulence in international developments.  If anything, the result of the UK referendum has placed an increased emphasis on re-doubling our efforts. At the same time, I know that the UK referendum result requires specific policy responses in parallel with the implementation of Enterprise 2025. My Department and others across government are taking action. The enterprise development agencies are working closely with companies to provide the support and advice needed. As part of Budget 2017 I secured additional resources for the Department and its agencies, with up to 50 additional staff to be provided to secure our ambitious indigenous exports, inward investment and jobs growth targets. My focus remains on achieving the Government&rsquo;s ambition of having an extra 200,000 at work by 2020. Details of action taken to date were provided in my earlier reply to a related question (REF 34327/16, question number 332 of November 10th 2016). </p>  <p>  In light of the foregoing, and notwithstanding the challenge facing us, I do not anticipate any revision to Enterprise 2025, or its ambition, at this time.</p></reply>

CETA is a comprehensive and progressive trade agreement between the EU and Canada.  It removes over 99% of tariffs that currently hinder trade between the EU and Canada.  It is expected to increase bilateral trade by &euro;12 billion per year, and to generate growth and new jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.  </p>  <p>  Given the position taken by Ireland and other Member States, the Commission submitted CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed Agreement.  That is one requiring both EU and individual Member States ratification.  As this process may take a number of years to complete the Agreement provides for provisional application.  The Agreement has now been signed so the next step is the ascent of the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that investment protection and investment dispute settlement provisions have been excluded from the provisional application of the Agreement.  This means these provisions will not come into being until voted for by the D&aacute;il and every other Member State according to their constitutional requirements.  </p>  <p>  The EU and Canada have also agreed a legally binding Joint Interpretative Instrument that has been added to CETA to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  </p>  <p>  The Government does not propose to seek an opinion from the European Court of Justice on the legality of the Investment Court System in CETA under EU law.  The Deputy will be aware that the opinion of the ECJ has already been sought in relation to the EU Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the outcome of this case is awaited.  </p>  <p>  CETA and the EU&rsquo;s other trade agreements help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  Ireland stands to gain substantially from this Agreement and I am looking forward to Irish firms enjoying the benefits and new opportunities as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Almost &euro;12.0m is provided for emergency refuge and support services and a further &euro;4.6m is provided for other community based domestic violence support services. The level of expenditure in this area will further increase in 2017, arising from the provision of &euro;37m in additional funding to Tusla for services generally.</p>  <p>  Tusla provides revenue funding towards the running costs of emergency refuge accommodation. Local authorities are responsible for capital funding in respect of emergency accommodation spaces. In the current year, Tusla is providing funding to support eight additional family units of accommodation; six additional family units of emergency accommodation in Dublin and Kildare and two emergency safe housing units in Sligo. The emergency domestic violence accommodation spaces in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing will be in addition to those already supported by Tusla.</p>  <p>  Tusla is engaged with a number of specialist domestic violence service provider organisations and other stakeholders about additional provision to support families in safe accommodation in 2017 and beyond. Tusla&rsquo;s focus is on achieving the optimum use of emergency shelter accommodation and effective community based services to avoid, in so far as possible, the need for use of refuges by vulnerable women and families. </p>  <p>  My priority, and that of Tusla, is to ensure that the needs of women and children fleeing domestic violence are being met in the most effective way possible. I am committed to continuing support for these vital services.</p></reply>
