I expect to be in a position to make a statement on the matter in the coming weeks, outlining the proposed revisions to the Guidelines and the timelines for implementation of the various elements shortly.</p>  <p>  It is important to mention that as part of the overall review, and having regard to a recent ECJ Judgement on the Belgian/Wallonian wind energy guidelines, it is intended to undertake a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of the proposed revisions to the 2006 Guidelines before they come into effect. This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive. In light of the SEA requirement which will take approximately 9 months, it is likely that while the proposals for revisions to the Guidelines will be available shortly, the Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until the end of the year.</p>  <p>  When finalised, revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that the re-cast RAPID programme will roll out in 2017. The logistical and other arrangements for that programme are currently under consideration in my Department.</p>  <p>  In relation to SICAP, there are a number of actions being undertaken, which my Department is leading out on, and which will lead to a better understanding of SICAP and its impacts, and which will inform my Department in reshaping the next iteration of SICAP, due to roll out in 2018. </p>  <p>  Firstly, I am leading a targeted national consultation process which will assist in the design of the next programme, involving national and regional sessions and a number of focus groups in which feedback is being sought from the key stakeholders involved. The consultation process offers a platform to consider how the programme can be refined and for solutions to be put forward in order to strengthen the programme from 2018. </p>  <p>  Secondly, the ESRI has begun a qualitative study looking at SICAP goals and its governance structure as part of a wider evaluation project. </p>  <p>  There will also be a qualitative research project looking at a cohort of SICAP participants - young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) - carried out by an external provider in 2017.  This research will examine how SICAP&rsquo;s Programme Implementers identify and engage with this target group, it will look at the types of outcomes being achieved for them and it will put forward good practice examples to inform the next iteration of the programme. </p>  <p>  The method for establishing contracts for the next SICAP programme is currently under consideration in my Department, commensurate with, inter alia, legal requirements, compliance with the Public Spending Code and value for money considerations.</p></reply>

Irish Water is also responsible for water services infrastructure including water supply pipes or drainage pipes extending from a waterworks or wastewater works to the curtilage of a private property.  </p>  <p>  Under sections 43 and 54 of the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for maintenance and replacement of any water or wastewater pipes, connections or distribution systems that are located within the boundary of a private property rests with the owner.  This was the position that pertained prior to the establishment of Irish Water, when individual local authorities held responsibility for public water services and infrastructure. </p>  <p>  While the legal position is set out in the 2007 Act, my Department is engaging with Irish Water to set out clearly the responsibilities of both Irish Water and property owners in relation to water supply and wastewater infrastructure.</p></reply>

In addition, national-level policy approaches in relation to residential densities in urban areas are set out in my Department&rsquo;s Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas, which place a heavy emphasis on the importance of provision of public infrastructure, such as public transport, community and sports facilities.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, progression of the forthcoming National Planning Framework, to be entitled Ireland 2040: Our Plan, will further clarify and enhance urban development policy in this area, for example in relation to identifying the potential to sustainably build up the economic vitality, population levels and supporting social and physical infrastructure of town centre and inner urban areas that in many cases have witnessed a sustained movement of people outwards to suburban and wider settings. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State Catherine Byrne,  recently launched the Communities Facilities Scheme, under which &euro;2m is being made available this year to fund projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social cohesion at a local level.  The Scheme is being managed at a local level by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in conjunction with the Municipal Districts, under the remit of the local authorities. </p>  <p>  I would also stress that the most appropriate forum for working through and resolving the issues raised by the Deputy is at local authority level. Within local authorities, the local elected members play a crucial role in addressing the issues raised by the Deputy, through identifying local social and community infrastructure requirements and the mechanisms to address these through  implementing statutory development plans and local economic and community plans, harnessing resources from local authority own finances, centrally voted expenditure and the contribution of the wider community, voluntary and private sectors.</p>  <p>  I am confident that, through working with my colleagues in Government and with local authorities, the communities we build into the future will be well planned and provide the relevant facilities to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated and that the building up of strategic urban areas will take account of the key need for appropriate community facilities.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Following on from the success of the initial Repair and Leasing pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, the pilot scheme was expanded on a national basis from 23 February 2017. </p>  <p>  In the period since the launch of the scheme, my Department has been engaging bilaterally with local authorities and AHBs and has convened the first of two planned workshops for local authority and AHB staff. My colleague, Minister of State English also recently met with the 4 Dublin Local Authorities and interested AHBs on my behalf, to create momentum behind the scheme in Dublin and to encourage early co-operation across all stakeholders. A Circular setting out the framework for delivery of the scheme issued to all local authorities on 28 March 2017 and a detailed guidance document, template legal agreements and other resources are now available to local authorities and AHBs. </p>  <p>  Local authorities have been invited to apply for delegated sanction from my Department to enter into leasing arrangements for a defined number of units under the scheme. The RLS has been designed to draw on the expertise and experience gained by AHBs on social housing acquisitions and leasing in recent years and it is open to local authorities to work in collaboration with AHBs in their areas to maximise the potential impact of the scheme. However, local authorities will retain overall responsibility for the implementation of the scheme in their area and for ensuring that housing units brought into use under the scheme are required and fulfil social housing demand in their areas. </p>  <p>  In recognition of both the critical demand for additional units and the potential the RLS scheme has to offer, I have assigned additional funding to the scheme in 2017, bringing the total amount of investment available this year to &euro;32m, which will facilitate up to 800 vacant properties being brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists. </p></reply>

The new approach recognises that the same pressures do not apply equally in all parts of the country.  It provides a significantly more detailed understanding of market behaviour in the rental sector and an objective evidence base required to appropriately target the Rent Predictability Measure introduced last year and designate the correct areas as Rent Pressure Zones.</p>  <p>  The new methodology allowed me to make an order on 26 January 2017 designating 12 Local Electoral Areas as rent pressure zones in parts of counties Cork, Galway, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  On 29 March 2017, I made a further two orders designating Maynooth and Cobh.  Altogether, some 57% of tenancies nationally are now located in rent pressure zones. </p>  <p>  The legislation only allows for Housing Authority areas or Local Electoral Areas to be designated as rent pressure zones.  For the purposes of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone. </p>  <p>  I have undertaken to carry out a review, in June this year, of the Rent Predictability provisions introduced under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016. At that point, the provisions will have been in place for 6 months and it will be possible to ascertain their effectiveness and whether any changes need to be made. The issues the Deputy raises in relation to the areas that can be designated as rent pressure zones will be considered in the context of that review.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p>  <p>  On 24 January 2017, the Housing Agency proposed that 15 Local Electoral Areas, including Greystones, should be considered for designation as rent pressure zones. On foot of the proposal from the Housing Agency, again in accordance with the Act, I requested the Director of the RTB to make a report to me as to whether these areas met the criteria for designation as Rent Pressure Zones. </p>  <p>  On 26 January 2017, I received a report from the RTB confirming that, based on rent data from Quarter 3 2016, 12 out of the 15 Local Electoral Areas examined met the criteria and I made Orders designating those 12 areas as Rent Pressure Zones on 26 January 2017.  In relation to Greystones, the RTB reported that, although the average rent there was above the average national rent, annual rent inflation had not been above 7% in four of the previous six quarters.  Accordingly, Greystones could not be designated a rent pressure zone.</p>  <p>  On 29 March the RTB published the Rent Index Report in relation to Quarter 4 2016, which includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating rent pressure zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country, allowing all interested parties to see exactly where their area stands in relation to rents and possible designation.  On the basis of this data  and in accordance with the procedures set out in the Act, I signed orders designating Maynooth and Cobh Rent Pressure Zones with effect from 30 March 2017.</p>  <p>  The most recent data shows that no other local electoral areas meet the criteria for designation at this time. The average rent in Greystones is above the national average, but the annual increase in rents in Greystones has been less than 7% in four of the last six quarters.  In Athy, the only Local Electoral Area in Kildare that is not a Rent Pressure Zone, and in all of Laois, the average rent is well below the national average. Currently none of these areas can be designated.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, I have no further role or discretion in proposing areas for designation as Rent Pressure Zones or in deciding whether they should be designated. The designation process is independent and based on clear objective criteria and quantifiable evidence.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p>  <p>  I have undertaken to carry out a review, in June this year, of the Rent Predictability provisions introduced under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016. At that point, the provisions will have been in place for 6 months and it will be possible to ascertain their effectiveness and whether any changes need to be made to, for example, the qualifying criteria or the designation process.</p></reply>

In this regard, Action 5.1 commits to the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy, informed by Census 2016 data, to:</p>  <p>  - inform the compilation of a register of vacant units across the country,</p>  <p>  - identify the number, location and reasons for longer-term vacancies (i.e. over 6 months) in high demand areas, and</p>  <p>  - set out a range of actions to bring vacant units back into re-use.</p>  <p>  To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for coordinating the development of the Strategy, established a working group in September 2016, comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy. The Working Group is presently concluding its deliberations on recommendations to be incorporated in the Strategy, with a view to facilitating and incentivising the greater re-utilisation of vacant properties. It is expected that the Strategy will be published next month.  </p></reply>

The PPP programme complements the increased Exchequer-funded capital expenditure which is part of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan.  PPP is just one of the methods of delivery being pursued under the Action Plan.  As an off-balance sheet source, it provides a means to access otherwise unavailable finance.  It should also be noted that the Programme is subject to comprehensive value for money tests, details of which, and the manner in which the tendering process is to be conducted, are set out in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 163 of 8 March 2017.</p>  <p>  The PPP programme will use what is termed an &lsquo;availability based&rsquo; PPP model, in which a private sector company designs, builds, finances and maintains the social housing units over a 25 year period in return for a monthly &lsquo;unitary payment&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;availability based&rsquo; model being applied has been used successfully in Ireland to deliver roads, schools, primary healthcare centres and courthouses.  The housing units will be handed back to the local authority after 25 years in a predefined, good quality condition.  The sites will remain in State ownership for the entire period.</p>  <p>  The relevant local authorities will retain responsibility for tenant nominations and the allocation of units during the contract period.  Tenants allocated to PPP units will be drawn from the local authority social housing waiting list in accordance with that local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  The tenants will be subject to standard arrangements as apply to other social housing allocations, including in respect of the charging of differential rent.</p>  <p>  The project comprising the first bundle of sites is being overseen by an established corporate governance structure.  The Project Board is chaired by the Chief Executive of Dublin City Council and each local authority is represented by a Director of Service.  My Department has two nominees, with the National Development Finance Agency also represented.  An independent Process Auditor attends Project Board meetings to assure that correct procedures are followed.  This structure operates effectively and provides for local authority participation and oversight in respect of the project.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's submission addresses some other issues on which my Department will respond directly, having considered the matters further.</p></reply>

This figure represents an increase of 1,728 households, or 1.9%, on the 89,872 households recorded in the last summary which was carried out in May 2013.  The results of the 2016 Summary are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, published in July 2016, sets out the Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing the current challenges in the housing sector.  Delivering on the ambitious targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland, including the commitment to deliver an additional 47,000 social housing units by 2021 and an accelerated roll-out of the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme, will address the needs of households on waiting lists. </p><p>The delivery against this target is already underway and 2016 saw over 19,000 social housing supports provided nationally, with expenditure of &euro;935 million on housing during the year. This exceeded the target of 17,240 for 2016, giving a very positive start to the challenge of meeting the ambitious targets in Rebuilding Ireland.  In 2017, it is planned to deliver social housing supports to at least 21,000 households. In addition, I expect to provide new social housing delivery targets for all local authorities later in Q2 2017, taking account of the results of the 2016 Assessments.</p><p>In line with previous commitments, statutory summaries of social housing assessments are now being  carried out on an annual basis, rather than every three years as was done in the past. These regular summaries will provide up-to-date and comprehensive data on the numbers of households qualified for social housing support on an on-going basis and will ensure that social housing supports delivered continue to match the variable profile of those in need.</p><p>Arrangements to carry out the 2017 summary are well advanced and I expect the results to be available for publication in the latter half of this year.</p></reply>

Work on this activity was carried out by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, despite a high level of engagement with a wide range of potential providers and financiers of social housing, no new model of provision and/or financing of social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified.</p>  <p>In response to this outcome, it was decided instead to commit &euro;10 million per annum from the Bord G&aacute;is proceeds, over a longer period, which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme.  Action 4.6 of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan   provided for the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  Provision was made for &euro;10 million to be allocated through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2017.</p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published Strategy for the Rental Sector, the commitment on affordable rental is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.  The cost of providing rental units is to be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers - AHB or private - allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the provision of &euro;10 million allocated for 2017 is being redirected to support additional activity under other housing programmes within my Department.</p>  <p>I am committed to continuing the effort to develop mechanisms that can deliver funding for social housing in a manner that is off-balance sheet and does not negatively impact on the general government balance.  Action 2.4 of Rebuilding Ireland   provides that the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) will work with the private sector to establish a funding vehicle capable of facilitating off-balance sheet investment in delivering social and private housing.  Work on developing the new funding vehicle is currently underway within the NTMA.</p></reply>

This &euro;5.35 billion investment comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure.

Individuals with a housing need who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP, avail of full-time work and retain their housing support.</p><p>HAP is now available nationwide to all eligible households in all local authority areas.  HAP has been rolled out on a phased basis since September 2014 with 7 local authorities delivering the scheme initially, 11 more authorities added in 2015, 10 added in 2016 and the final 3 Dublin authorities providing HAP from 1 March 2017.  The phased nature of the HAP roll-out has allowed for significant learning in the operation of the scheme.  In this way, new HAP authorities have benefitted from the experience of those authorities where the scheme has been previously operational.At the end of Quarter 1 2017, there were more than 19,600 households being supported by the scheme.  Some 300 additional households are currently having their housing need met each week by HAP, with a total of 3,765 HAP tenancies set-up in the first quarter of 2017.</p><p>As HAP is a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.  With the completion of the HAP roll-out and the ending of the scheme&rsquo;s pilot phase, I recently signed a Ministerial Direction instructing local authorities to continue to offer HAP tenants access to other forms of social housing through the transfer list. </p><p>A new HAP website,<i>www.hap.ie </i>, was recently launched and provides prospective HAP tenants and landlords with the information that they need to better understand how HAP works.  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme committed to under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

I note that there is considerable common ground between the NERI report and the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and Strategy for the Rental Sector.  For example, and in line with Rebuilding Ireland, the NERI report concludes that: supply is the most significant challenge at present; there is a need to increase public investment in new permanent social housing stock; traditional patterns of demand are changing: increased labour market mobility and wider economic factors are encouraging a lesser reliance on home ownership; a significant proportion of the required new stock needs to be provided specifically for rental; the State needs to create the right conditions for investment in the delivery of rental accommodation; and that local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Housing Finance Agency all have a key role to play in the delivery of housing.</p>  <p>  Through Rebuilding Ireland, the Government is progressing a range of actions to meet these challenges. Over the lifetime of the plan, the overall social housing stock will be increased by providing 47,000 social housing units through local authorities and approved housing bodies using &euro;5.3billion in capital funding and Housing Finance Agency loan finance.  In addition, under the strategy for the rental sector, a range of supply side measures are being progressed including: build to rent models; use of State-owned lands to deliver affordable rental in areas of high demand; measures to increase the supply of dedicated student accommodation to free-up units in the general rental market; supports to bring vacant stock into use; consideration of tax and fiscal incentives to encourage additional supply. </p>  <p>  In addition to the commitment to advancing projects to deliver additional rental accommodation, the strategy for the rental sector noted that the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to develop a "cost rental" option, taking account of work already completed in this area, including by NESC and others.  This is also the central recommendation in the report by NERI.</p>  <p>  In line with this commitment, action 12 of the strategy for the rental sector provides that my Department will lead an expert group to develop a cost rental model for the Irish rental sector, addressing issues such as funding mechanisms, the need to grow the necessary institutional capacity, particularly within the AHB sector - whether through mergers, new entrants or strategic partnerships - the households to be targeted and the appropriate regulation mechanisms.  The expert group will consider the proposals put forward by NERI - including the proposal to establish a semi-State company to progress the cost rental model - in the course of its work, which is scheduled to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. </p>  <p>  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met up-front by the local authority or an AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum period of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.  The scope and cost of the works required, and the recoupment of the works cost through the lease payments, will be agreed between the property owner and the local authority or AHB.  The maximum cost of repairs allowable under the scheme is &euro;40,000.</p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities; the local authority or AHB will be the landlord and will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.  The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme, having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into account the extent of repairs that may be required. </p>  <p>  Depending on the manner in which a local authority elects to operate the scheme in their administrative area, property owners may apply directly to their local authority in respect of the scheme or to a participating AHB.  Properties must be vacant for at least one year, and property owners and contractors engaged under the scheme must demonstrate that they are tax compliant through the provision of tax clearance certificates on request.  Local authorities retain overall responsibility for ensuring that housing units brought into use under the scheme are required and fulfil social housing demand in their areas, and will have full nomination rights for units delivered through AHB led mechanisms.</p></reply>

For example, the unprecedented increase in the Government&rsquo;s social housing investment programme to &euro;5.35 billion over a six-year period is already ramping up social housing supply.  Last year, &euro;935 million was invested in providing some 19,000 social housing supports.  Almost 5,300 homes were built, refurbished or acquired and some 12,000 housing assistance payment tenancies were established. In 2017, some 21,000 households will have their social housing needs met.  </p><p>With regard to the wider housing market, the ambition under Rebuilding Ireland is also to increase and accelerate the supply of homes for those who do not qualify for social housing support.  Under pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland, I am working across Government and with other stakeholders, using all the levers available, to activate idle sites, particularly in urban areas where demand is greatest, so as to deliver affordable, mixed tenure housing at scale.</p><p>While I am fully aware of the considerable further progress required to activate housing development sites and to increase and accelerate delivery to the scale required, the indicators are positive and the latest residential commencements and completions data show that house-building activity is continuing to grow. </p><p>Completions for the 12 month period to end January 2017 stood at 15,256 homes, an 18% increase year on year.  Likewise, commencement notices for 13,334 new homes were submitted in the twelve month period to end January 2017, an increase of 44% year on year. Importantly, multi-unit developments, that is developments other than one-off houses, currently represent 69% of all housing commencements up from 60% in 2015.  My expectation is that some 18,000 homes will be completed nationally this year.</p><p>As committed to under Rebuilding Ireland, my Department has developed a monthly housing activity report, which provides monthly updates on a range of statistics.  This report is published on the Rebuilding Ireland website,<i>www.rebuildingireland.ie</i>.  </p><p>I believe that, through the range of actions currently being progressed through Rebuilding Ireland to increase the supply of homes across all tenures, the Government has created the conditions required for the restoration of a more sustainable and normally functioning housing market, capable of providing homes, at affordable price points to buy or rent, where and when they are needed.</p></reply>

Overcrowding may give rise to concerns in respect of fire safety, and may lead to enforcement action by fire authorities.  Situations of overcrowding should be reported to the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  Partial use of houses as overnight guest accommodation, essentially for B&amp;B purposes, is provided for as an exempted development under Regulation 10(4) of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as long as not more than four bedrooms in a house are used and not more than four persons are accommodated in a bedroom.</p>  <p>  Using a residential property as hostel accommodation is not exempted development and constitutes a change of use which would require planning permission.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness published in July 2016, further reinforces the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the area of urban regeneration.</p><p>In this regard, the Programme for Government specifically commits to examining a series of initiatives in the area of urban regeneration, such as:</p><p>-  the introduction of a scheme similar to the &lsquo;Living City Initiative&rsquo; to regenerate urban centres and villages throughout Ireland, </p><p>-  examining the scope to reform the Derelict Sites Act to tackle the under-use and hoarding of derelict land by the State, semi-State and private sectors,</p><p>-  the establishment of a National Register of Derelict Sites, in addition to the new vacant site levy, to bring vacant and under-utilised sites into beneficial use for housing and urban regeneration purposes,</p><p>-  the mandating of local authorities with better land management powers, including the possibility of additional CPO capabilities, and </p><p>-  various other measures, which have subsequently been developed under Rebuilding Ireland, particularly under Pillar 5, aimed at bringing vacant housing stock into reuse and which have already been launched such as the Repair and Leasing Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme, and the &euro;70m rolling fund to enable the Housing Agency to purchase vacant properties on the portfolios of financial institutions and investors for social housing use.</p><p>To drive forward these and other considerations, a Working Group, which I chair and comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and other relevant bodies, has been established to bring forward proposals for new urban regeneration measures as early as possible.  It is intended that the new measures will complement the existing regeneration programme under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Capital Programme, as well as other social regeneration initiatives already under way.

The Local Government Fund, through General Purpose Grants (GPGs), historically provided local authorities with finance for funding some of their day-to-day activities, including elements of water services costs.  In 2014, certain water services costs were moved to Irish Water, resulting in a reduced funding requirement for local authorities from the Local Government Fund and, in 2015, LPT allocations to local authorities replaced GPGs.  Local authorities now receive funding from Irish Water for services provided under service level agreements.  Local authorities also receive significant other funding, current and capital, from my Department and from other Departments and agencies for a range of activities, such as housing and the maintenance of non-national roads, for example.  While capital funding levels declined in line with the national economic circumstances, they have now started to increase significantly again.</p><p>The combined impact of these changes is that income proportion figures from 2010 are, therefore, not directly comparable to more recent years.</p><p>The levying and collection of rates is a matter for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of the local authority as part of the annual budget based on what level of income is considered necessary in order to provide the required level of services.  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 and 2016 are not directly comparable due to local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas.</p><p>It is important to note that, while income from commercial rates in 2015 makes up an increased proportion of local authorities' income compared to 2010, the actual quantum of rates income has not increased significantly in monetary terms from 2010 (&euro;1.43bn) to 2015 (&euro;1.496bn).</p><p>Further details of the funding available to local authorities is reported in the Chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General on Central Government Funding of Local Authorities, the most recent of which is available at: </p><p><i></i>.</p></reply>

The Act applies to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions which are set out in section 3(2) of the Act. Student accommodation is not specifically exempt under the Act. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the Act applies to student accommodation that is the subject of a tenancy and the protections under the Act do apply to such tenancies. However, section 25(4) of the Act provides for an exemption of certain purpose built student accommodation from Part 4 of the Act, which relates to security of tenure provisions. These tenancies are still protected under the remaining provisions of the Act. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants. Where a dwelling is occupied by a person under a tenancy to which the Act does not apply or under an arrangement or agreement which is not a tenancy, such as instances where a bona fide licensing arrangement exists, the RTB does not have any function in relation to such agreements or arrangements. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where it is unclear as to whether a particular rental agreement is a tenancy or a licence, the RTB can adjudicate on the question and has done so in the past.  Where it finds that a tenancy is unregistered due to the landlord&rsquo;s wrongful claim of licence, the RTB can serve a notice requiring registration and failure to comply is an offence.</p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to amend the Act to include licensing arrangements for student accommodation.</p></reply>

The Review Group made recommendations in areas such as culture; leadership and structure; audit and risk management; corporate functions and IT systems; and benchmarks. Significant progress has been made in implementing these recommendations as outlined below and the work of embedding and sustaining the changes continues to be prioritised in my Department.  </p><p>The following recommendations, which mirror many of the actions set out in the Civil Service Renewal Plan, have been implemented in the Department: </p><p>-  The Department&rsquo;s Management Advisory Committee was reconstituted as a Management Board, new personnel were appointed, both from within the Department and externally, and lateral mobility put into effect.  A new Deputy Secretary post was created in April 2015 to provide more cohesive leadership across the criminal justice portfolio and following a competition, a Secretary General was permanently appointed in October 2016.  Both I and the Minister of State for Equality, Immigration and integration meet on a monthly basis with the full Management Board;</p><p>-  Following consultation, a Culture and Values Charter was published in 2016 with the objective of fostering a more outward facing, listening organisational culture. These values have been signed off by the Department's leadership team and are fed into all induction and leadership training with a view to informing the way in which the Department communicates with staff and stakeholders.  It is recognised that changes to organisational culture takes sustained effort over time and a cross grade team, led by the Secretary General, is working to ensure that this continues to be embedded in the organisation;</p><p>-  Robust supporting processes have been put in place to enhance leadership and oversight of the Department and wider sector and to facilitate more effective management and governance of the strategic objectives. A Corporate Governance Framework for the Department was published in April 2016.  Since 2015 an annual Strategic Plan has been published, which draws together in one single plan all the strategic priorities across the Department. To support the Management Board in its oversight of this programme, a programme management reporting system has been implemented, progress is monitored monthly by the Management Board and twice yearly progress reports are published on the website;</p><p>-Risk management processes have been significantly strengthened and the Department's Audit Committee which has a majority of external members has reviewed its processes in line with the recommendations;</p><p>-  Since March 2014, the Department has also put in place revised systems and procedures to ensure that<b></b>all correspondence is handled appropriately which specifies that high priority correspondence is brought to the attention of both myself and relevant officials and followed up in a timely manner;</p><p>-  The Report made several recommendations regarding relationship management and oversight of Agencies, all of which have been implemented. Agency performance and governance arrangements have been formalised and strengthened through formal Performance/Service Delivery Agreements and Frameworks<b></b>agreed with 24 key agencies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as mentioned above. In addition, as the Deputy is aware, the Policing Authority was established in January 2016 to bring a new and dedicated layer of public accountability to the administration of policing services and provide additional impetus to drive necessary changes in the policing system and its practices.</p><p>-  Formal structures have been put in place to support communication and collaboration with the agencies in the Justice and Equality sector: the Civil Agencies Network covers a range of diverse agencies and meets quarterly to share information and best practise while the Criminal Justice Strategic Committee comprising the heads of all the relevant agencies was established in 2015.  The Strategic Committee also meets quarterly and is driving effective collaboration through a detailed work-plan on a range of shared interests from international cooperation, data needs and interoperability to leadership development and victims services.</p><p>-  A programme of work in regard to Data and Information has been developed and is being taken forward in cooperation with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, including a system providing real time support to the front-line Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC) programme, the roll-out of an e-Submissions system and the development of the Justice and Equality Hub, to facilitate better collaboration and information sharing between the Department and its stakeholders and the provision of data and management information to support the development of more evidence based policy;</p><p>-  Many of the Review Group's recommendations related to Human Resources management and the Department held an open competition last year to appoint a professional Head of Strategic Human Resources.  Following this appointment, a three year workforce plan has been developed which directly supports the Department&rsquo;s 2016-2019 Strategy and informs recruitment and deployment of available resources to effectively deliver on the Department's business objectives as well as identifying training needs.  The 2017 training plan includes risk management, customer service, leadership development and performance management.  The Department is also developing its HR capacity, including the recent implementation of a business partner model to try to ensure that the business needs, including managed mobility and succession planning, are being met by HR.  A HR strategy is being prepared which will reflect the changes being implemented since the Toland Report and which will reflect the internal Change Programme, the forthcoming Civil Service HR strategy and public service reform.</p><p>-  A Head of Communications was appointed and a strategy covering internal and external communications in support of the change programme was published in 2016.</p><p>New structured governance arrangements with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also been introduced.  A Governance Framework Document is in place which makes provision, amongst other things, for regular Governance meetings including tripartite meetings involving my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority.  In that context, senior officials meet monthly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a senior management level to oversee progress on  strategic and resource matters such as the Modernisation and Renewal Programme, IR issues, Garda recruitment, civilianisation, ICT, and Garda buildings.  The Department also participates in the Garda ICT Oversight Board monitoring the ongoing ICT Programme which forms an integral part of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme.  In addition, arrangements are in place for quarterly meetings involving the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority in the context of the Authority's statutory functions in relation to advising the Minister with regard to Garda resources.</p><p>In addition to the ongoing reforms in the policing area, achieving better collaborative practice and parallel to implementing the major change programme, the Deputy will be aware of the volume of work delivered over the past 3 years on the Department's business agenda across very significant areas of public life. Major achievements include the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015, the Marriage Equality Referendum, International Protection Act 2015 incorporating a single applications procedure and implementation of the McMahon report recommendations, progressing the implementation of the EU Victims Directive, establishment of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) to meet Ireland&rsquo;s international humanitarian obligations, amongst many others.</p><p>In terms of recommendations not yet implemented, the Review Group recommended the development of a HR strategy which is in preparation in parallel with the Civil Service HR Strategy as mentioned above.  It also recommended changes to the Department&rsquo;s structure but was not definitive on the detail of this.  The Department&rsquo;s structure has been reviewed in recent months and a number of options for structural changes are under consideration.  Given the workload on hand, it is envisaged that structural change will be implemented on a phased basis.It should be noted, however, that despite concerns expressed by the Review Group about the breadth of its responsibilities, my Department's remit has continued to expand significantly in recent years with responsibility assigned in 2015 for additional agencies including the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  In addition, since the Review Group reported, the Charities Regulator, the Policing Authority and the Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been all been established.  Clearly all of these are necessary bodies but it remains the case that my Department has an expanding remit with associated risks.  </p><p>Finally, I should add that over the next few months the Department will be taking stock of the changes implemented to date with a view to ensuring that the measures outlined above are embedded, sustained and further developed, continuing to take account of the wider process of Civil Service Renewal.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>This process will also examine priorities for the next phase of reform with a view to driving continuous improvement.</p></reply>

Of the 81 recommendations in the Inspectorate report 74 were directed to the Garda Commissioner.  Of these, 71 were accepted or accepted subject to modifications.  The vehicle for the implementation of the agreed recommendations is the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation &amp;amp; Renewal Programme 2016-2021, the overall aim of which is to modernise and professionalise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the 21st century.  Key agreed reforms include the roll-out of a Divisional model of policing and further civilianisation.</p>  <p>  Government has agreed that the current District model of policing will be replaced on a phased basis with a Divisional one where responsibilities are allocated on a functional rather than a geographical basis subject to appropriate modifications to meet the needs of large rural Divisions and ensure that the close relationship with communities is maintained.  Four pilots are in train and are due to be evaluated later this year.  The number of regions and Divisions will be maintained at six and 28 respectively for the time being but will be reviewed as the Divisional model is rolled out.</p>  <p>  In relation to civilianisation, the Government, in line with international experience, agreed a medium term goal of 20% civilians to be adopted for the overall Garda workforce to be achieved through (i) a 'civilian by default policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and (ii) redeployment of Garda&iacute; and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  Garda management is developing a workforce plan to achieve this. </p>  <p>  I have referred the agreed recommendations of the Inspectorate report to the Policing Authority in accordance with section 117A(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to monitor and assess their implementation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report progress to me on a quarterly basis.  I received the first progress report from the Authority in January.  The second is due later this month.  Given the scale and five-year time frame of the reform plan, the Authority reported that its initial attention had been focussed on understanding the agreed recommendations and the MRP, establishing robust structures to ensure a focus is created and maintained on this priority area of work and on identifying a number of priority areas for attention including to ensure that the benefits of investment are realised.  In particular, it has established a dedicated committee to undertake this work area.  While the report acknowledges that substantive reform will take time and persistence by the Commissioner, it notes a very welcome start on further civilianisation.  I expect that reports in due course will include more detailed assessments of the progress, including actions taken and timelines, on the implementation of the  agreed recommendations.  I have asked my officials to consult with the Authority in relation to how its future progress reports in relation to the implementation could be put into the public domain.</p></reply>

However, a process to do so was established with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008 which resulted in the publication of status implementation update reports twice a year on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.  The last such regular update was published in November 2013 when, I understand, the process was interrupted due to pressure of work. </p><p>However, the Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are now working towards the production, in tabular form, of a document which will indicate the position regarding the implementation of recommendations contained in a number of Inspectorate reports up to and including the Crime Investigation report.  Once completed, the results will be published on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.  As the time frame for the conclusion of this work is not clear, my Department has asked for quarterly updates as to the progress in relation to this matter. </p><p>It should be noted that the statutory position regarding the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in Inspectorate reports has changed.  Section 117(A) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides for a role for the Policing Authority in monitoring the measures taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the recommendations contained in reports prepared by the Inspectorate. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner published her Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 in June 2016.  This Programme includes recommendations from the various Garda Inspectorate Reports, including the two most recent Inspectorate Reports referred to above.  Key reforms being implemented include the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis.  This will be subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in large rural Divisions.  In line with international norms, a medium term target of 20% civilians to be achieved by 2021 has been set. </p><p>The implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme is primarily a matter for the Commissioner.  However, the Government decided that the Policing Authority should be requested to monitor the implementation of the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and to report to me at regular intervals.  I have received the first such progress report from the Policing Authority.  Their next progress report is due by the end of April.</p><p>In July, the Government approved a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This Plan marries the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' with a major investment programme that will increase the number of garda&iacute; to 15,000; double the number of civilians to 4,000; and more than double the number of reserves members to 2,000.  This investment in human capital is supported by a &euro;300 million capital plan that will deliver leading-edge technology and other capital infrastructure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2017 Estimates reflect this commitment by providing the resources to recruit 800 garda&iacute;, 500 civilians and 300 reserves in 2017. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that at the Government meeting earlier this week I received approval to begin the process of establishing a Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I expect that the Commission will have regard to appropriate structures for oversight and accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

My Department received a copy of the draft report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Head of the Internal Audit on 16 September 2016.  I understand that the draft report was sent to all interested parties for their observations before being finalised.  This was in accordance with standard practice on reports of this nature.  My Department has been in ongoing communication with Garda management in relation to the Report since receipt of the draft.</p>  <p>  A copy of the final Report was received by my Department from the Garda Commissioner on 27 March 2017 and was forwarded for my attention by way of submission from my officials on 28 March 2017. </p>  <p>  The Report raises serious issues in relation to accounting practices and procedures in the Garda College that must be addressed comprehensively.  Some of the main issues of concern highlighted by the Report include the manner in which the College was run, the existence of a large number of bank accounts and investment accounts linked to the College, staffing issues and issues relating to the ownership and use of certain lands.  These are serious issues in relation to governance and accountability in the College that must be addressed comprehensively and the Garda Commissioner, as the Accounting Officer for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts, must take the lead role in this regard.  </p>  <p>  I have been assured that the Garda authorities recognise the gravity of the issues raised and that they are taking proactive steps to progress the recommendations in the Report.  In particular, a Steering Committee, chaired by the Chief Administrative Officer and including a representative the Department of Justice and Equality, has been established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and external governance expertise and auditors have been engaged.   </p>  <p>  I am informed that there are several aspects to the implementation of the recommendations that require further consideration to ensure that there is a full understanding of the extent of the issues identified and the implications of the actions required to put the appropriate governance structures and financial and operational processes and procedures in place in the College to address fully the recommendations and the future development of the College.  This work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  In view of the gravity of the issues raised, I requested the Policing Authority on 29 March 2017 to oversee the implementation of the Report's recommendations and to report back to me on a quarterly basis in relation to progress being made.</p></reply>

The questionnaire, therefore, does not and cannot indicate any time-frame for its return.  The indicated time-frame for return is detailed with the accompanying documentation.</p><p>Applicants have a duty to cooperate, as set out in Section 27 of the International Protection Act 2015 (the 2015 Act), and there are consequences for failing to cooperate set out in Section 38.  It is entirely appropriate and necessary, therefore, to include a warning to that effect in the questionnaire.  It should also be noted that Section 38 of the 2015 Act, which deals with the consequences of non-cooperation, sets out specifically the procedure to be followed in these cases and gives applicants ample opportunities to address any potential non-cooperation issues.</p><p>The paragraph referred to in the Deputy's question points out that applicants <i>may</i>be found not to be cooperating if the form is not returned on time and applies where no explanation or request for additional time to complete it has been received.  The warning will be valid as part of the ongoing work of the organisation.  The CIPO informs me that adherence to time frames helps to ensure that the work of the office is conducted efficiently and that applicants get timely decisions, particularly those in prioritised categories.  For those applications made since the commencement of the 2015 Act, the IPO is asking applicants to adhere to the time-frames indicated.</p><p>Regarding the information sent to transition applicants (i.e. those applicants who commenced proceedings under the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) and are now being processed under the 2015 International Protection Act), Paragraph 7.3 clearly states that the IPO 2 Questionnaire should be returned 'if possible, no later than 20 working days from the date of the covering letter'.  The next paragraph 7.4 goes on to state clearly that opportunities to add to the information supplied exist up to two weeks, 'if you are in a position to do so', before the scheduled interview in order to <i>'facilitate the translation of documents if required and ensure that the IPO interviewer has all your papers available and considered  in advance of the interview date'</i>.  The word deadline or statutory deadline does not appear in this correspondence and no negative consequences for failing to meet an 'if possible' time frame were included or implied.</p><p>Flexibility is being provided by the IPO in recognition of the complexity of the process for applicants affected by the transition provisions and the demands placed on their legal advisors by the transitional arrangements - the wisdom of accessing legal advice is stressed in the Questionnaire.  A call centre is available to answer any queries and extra time is available if required for the completion of the  IPO 2 Questionnaire.  It can be seen, therefore, that no impediment or disadvantage exists to prevent the careful filling out of the new single application form.</p></reply>

The cable lands in Killala County Mayo and interconnects New York, Dublin and London.  Aqua Comms is a provider of data connectivity and bandwidth infrastructure services for content providers, cloud-based networks, data centres, IT companies and the global media.  Its network will be used by major multinational technology and telecoms companies to provide fast, secure data connections between Ireland, the US and UK and will enable the continued growth of the Irish digital economy.</p>  <p>  - ISIF also rolled an existing (National Pensions Reserve Fund) commitment in daa plc's public bond, which was issued in 2008 (repayable in 2018), into a &euro;35 million commitment in a new 2028 public bond issuance by daa, the operator of Dublin and Cork Airports.  This continues ISIF's role as a long-term, strategic, domestic investor in daa.

This plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current housing crisis, of which the HTB incentive is just one.  The comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy (HTB) scheme should be considered. Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan.  The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Therefore, the impact of the HTB incentive on property prices should not be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.  In my view, it is the lack of supply that is primarily responsible for driving house prices higher and I would point out that increases in house prices prevailed long before the introduction of the Help to Buy incentive.  I would also point out that the HTB is targeted towards new build homes only, and to first-time buyers only, and it would be simplistic to designate this incentive as being the sole or the major contributor to house price increases.  Furthermore, the incentive is designed to help first-time buyers obtain the deposit required to facilitate the purchase of a home.  Therefore it helps first-time buyers to meet the loan to value requirements of the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.  However, the loan to income requirements of those rules must also be satisfied and the HTB pays no role in relation to that aspect. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including movements in property prices. In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that I have already committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the incentive which will look at, among other issues, its potential impact on property prices.  The contract for this assessment, following the completion of a competitive tendering process, will be awarded shortly.</p></reply>

I am advised by The Revenue Commission that the supply of dog grooming services is liable to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  Under the EU VAT Directive, there is no provision to allow the reduced rate to be applied to the supply of dog grooming services. </p>  <p>  The EU VAT Directive also allows for the continuation of a historic VAT rating.  Where a Member State applied a zero or reduced VAT rate to a good or service on and from 1 January 1991, they are entitled to retain that historic VAT treatment.  Dog grooming services did not apply a zero or reduced VAT rate on 1 January 1991 and as such it is not possible to apply a reduced or zero VAT rate to the service now.</p>  <p>  As Ireland applied a reduced VAT rate to the supply of services by a veterinary surgeon on and from 1 January 1991 we can continue to apply the 13.5% rate to these services.  In this context, where a veterinary surgeon carries out a dog grooming service as part of a veterinary procedure, such as treating an illness or disease, the dog grooming is considered part of the veterinary procedure and the entire procedure is liable to VAT at the 13.5% rate.  However, where a veterinary surgeon provides a dog grooming services as a supply that is distinct from a veterinary procedure the service is liable to VAT at the 23% rate.</p></reply>

In accordance with this, ISIF's investment strategy and its activities are closely aligned with and support Government policy across a wide range of areas, including: housing, the agri-sector, communications and energy.</p>  <p>  ISIF has already committed &euro;2.7 billion and it acts as a catalyst for other investors to invest in Irish projects.  This includes a commitment of &euro;361m to Infrastructure investment essential to the future competitiveness of the Irish economy.  In addition, ISIF's ability to attract co-investment from the private sector means that &euro;7 billion of total investment has been committed up to end December 2016.</p>  <p>  Only a certain amount of any capital investment programme can be deliverable via either direct Government expenditure or traditional, proven sources of commercial investment such as PPPs.  Therefore, in the course of implementing its investment strategy and conducting its activities, ISIF has been playing an important role, as both an investor and as a catalyst for private investment, in respect of the capital plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment, 2016-2021. </p>  <p>  As a public fund, it is important to the ISIF's success that the commercial investment decisions taken under its mandate are consistent with Government policy.  In this regard, ISIF's investment policy dovetails with Government policy while also, critically, maintaining the commercial mandate which is at ISIF's core.</p>  <p>  ISIF has made a number of investments which support the objectives and principles of the Capital Plan, including investments in student accommodation, enabling infrastructure for residential development and innovative energy investments.  There are strong two-way working relationships between ISIF and the relevant Government Departments and bodies, in order to ensure that ISIF investments are coherent, consistent and co-ordinated with Government policy.  Some noteworthy outcomes arising from such engagement include:</p>  <p>  - ISIF's investments under the Connectivity Fund, with a combined value of &euro;57 million, in the areas of telecommunications connectivity with both our European and US neighbours, as well as in transport connectivity through investment in Dublin airport.</p>  <p>  - Energy commitments of &euro;44 million to the Dublin Waste to Energy project, &euro;35 million to NTR's onshore wind fund and &euro;76 million investment in Greencoat Renewables DAC.</p>  <p>  - Commitments to housing investment of &euro;325 million in Activate Capital, &euro;25 million in the Ardstone Residential Partnership and &euro;54 million in student accommodation in DCU.</p>  <p>  - Cornerstone investor in the Irish Infrastructure Fund (IIF) managed by AMP Capital. </p>  <p>  In this way, ISIF plays an important role as a key link between Government, semi-State bodies and the private sector.  Such a strategic position is important for the continued investment in Ireland's infrastructure and, indeed our future economic growth and expansion. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, given ISIF's new and unique mandate as a sovereign development fund, and because of the uncertainty regarding the investment opportunities in Ireland, it was agreed that a formal review of the ISIF investment strategy would take place after 18 months.  This was to allow for a sufficient period of time having elapsed before considering the operations and impact of the Fund. </p>  <p>  The investment strategy review is ongoing and is examining the performance and impact of ISIF.  The review includes an appraisal of the success of ISIF's mandate to end December 2016 and involves interactions with both my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the process.  The review itself is due for completion shortly.  </p></reply>

Accordingly, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the likely impact on revenue streams based on the exchange rate scenarios set out by the Deputy. <table><tr><th>Receipts</th><th>Oils</th><th>Alcohols</th><th>Tobacco</th><th>VRT</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>Jul-15</td><td>&euro;185.72</td><td>&euro;98.90</td><td>&euro;81.18</td><td>&euro;91.99</td><td>&euro;457.79</td></tr><tr><td>Aug-15</td><td>&euro;178.30</td><td>&euro;105.97</td><td>&euro;103.43</td><td>&euro;54.44</td><td>&euro;442.14</td></tr><tr><td>Sep-15</td><td>&euro;181.20</td><td>&euro;91.60</td><td>&euro;70.38</td><td>&euro;32.68</td><td>&euro;375.86</td></tr><tr><td>Oct-15</td><td>&euro;185.04</td><td>&euro;103.00</td><td>&euro;109.76</td><td>&euro;27.22</td><td>&euro;425.02</td></tr><tr><td>Nov-15</td><td>&euro;171.58</td><td>&euro;132.94</td><td>&euro;93.07</td><td>&euro;19.53</td><td>&euro;417.12</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-15</td><td>&euro;106.96</td><td>&euro;92.02</td><td>&euro;277.01</td><td>&euro;14.68</td><td>&euro;490.67</td></tr><tr><td>Jan-16</td><td>&euro;240.88</td><td>&euro;126.81</td><td>&euro;1.16</td><td>&euro;158.29</td><td>&euro;527.14</td></tr><tr><td>Feb-16</td><td>&euro;173.79</td><td>&euro;57.14</td><td>&euro;100.11</td><td>&euro;109.40</td><td>&euro;440.44</td></tr><tr><td>Mar-16</td><td>&euro;184.74</td><td>&euro;74.86</td><td>&euro;112.11</td><td>&euro;103.46</td><td>&euro;475.17</td></tr><tr><td>Apr-16</td><td>&euro;187.84</td><td>&euro;105.12</td><td>&euro;113.86</td><td>&euro;69.24</td><td>&euro;476.06</td></tr><tr><td>May-16</td><td>&euro;184.61</td><td>&euro;89.44</td><td>&euro;172.14</td><td>&euro;49.49</td><td>&euro;495.68</td></tr><tr><td>Jun-16</td><td>&euro;184.66</td><td>&euro;101.07</td><td>&euro;161.41</td><td>&euro;29.67</td><td>&euro;476.81</td></tr><tr><td>Jul-16</td><td>&euro;177.23</td><td>&euro;106.04</td><td>&euro;157.76</td><td>&euro;114.64</td><td>&euro;555.67</td></tr><tr><td>Aug-16</td><td>&euro;184.57</td><td>&euro;104.45</td><td>&euro;59.81</td><td>&euro;61.17</td><td>&euro;410.00</td></tr><tr><td>Sep-16</td><td>&euro;187.98</td><td>&euro;106.03</td><td>&euro;24.96</td><td>&euro;38.95</td><td>&euro;357.92</td></tr><tr><td>Oct-16</td><td>&euro;177.72</td><td>&euro;112.05</td><td>&euro;56.52</td><td>&euro;35.18</td><td>&euro;381.47</td></tr><tr><td>Nov-16</td><td>&euro;185.01</td><td>&euro;113.84</td><td>&euro;70.99</td><td>&euro;22.83</td><td>&euro;392.67</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-16</td><td>&euro;99.45</td><td>&euro;110.64</td><td>&euro;66.88</td><td>&euro;21.89</td><td>&euro;298.86</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-06a.323.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040600060#WRJ01600"><p>Contingency planning for Brexit has been ongoing at all levels of Government well in advance of the UK EU referendum in June 2016.  Ireland has a successful track record of competing for, and winning, global foreign direct investment.  One of the key pillars of that success is the growth of the International Financial Services (IFS) sector, in particular over the past 30 years.  Ireland is now recognised internationally as a leading global centre for internationally traded financial services.</p>  <p>  In March 2015, the Government launched the lFS2020 Strategy, a whole-of-government approach to further driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland.  Implementation of the IFS2020 Strategy and the annual Action Plans is driven by a public sector High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC).  The HLIC, meeting on a quarterly basis, is chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services Eoghan Murphy TD.  Minister of State Murphy also chairs quarterly meetings of the IFS2020 Joint Committee, comprising of members of the public sector HLIC and senior IFS industry representatives.  Brexit is a standing agenda item at these quarterly meetings.  </p>  <p>  The Government is keen to maximise on opportunities that arise from Brexit where possible.  The IFS2020 Strategy, the long-term vision for international financial services, was developed and put in place long before the UK decision to leave the EU.  However, it provides a clear framework to maximise any opportunities that might arise from that decision particularly through the annual Action Plans.  The annual Action Plans enable a tailored response to deal with these challenges and opportunities as they arise.  The IFS2020 Strategy combines long-term strategic thinking with the flexible tools to react to any domestic and international developments occurring over the period.  </p>  <p>  In January Minister of State Murphy launched the IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017, the Action Plan has two sections, the first is a contextual piece in respect of Brexit, and the second section outlines the 40 specific measures to be actioned under the plan and the lead government departments, agencies or industry bodies who lead on each measure.  </p>  <p>  Also in January, the second annual European Financial Forum was held in Dublin Castle.  The forum, which was hosted by Minister of State Murphy is designed to showcase Ireland's financial services offering to an international audience and highlight the Government's commitment to the development of international financial services in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Since his appointment Minister of State Murphy has undertaken a significant number of overseas visits to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment and launch the IFS Ireland banner brand.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the role of the Central Bank of Ireland, the Central Bank does not have a promotional mandate and legally cannot promote Ireland for financial services investment.  The clear mandate of the bank is to protect consumers and ensure the financial stability of the state.  A key component of a successful and attractive jurisdiction for the location of financial service firms is a strong and independent regulator, with international credibility.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is well resourced to meet the current level of demand and enquiries that are being presented.  The Central Bank Commission has recently approved additional complement of 170 staff for 2017 to bring the Central Bank's total staffing to 1,800 full-time equivalents.  The 2017 expansion includes dedicated resources of additional staff to address specific Brexit-related new business needs.  The Central Bank also plans to assess on a regular basis the need for contingency-based extra Brexit related hiring in response to additional business volumes.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is already engaging with a significant number of firms across all sectors, and is committed to providing a high quality, fair and transparent authorisation process for all applicants.

This has included meetings with the European Commission in order to highlight the benefits of relocating the Authority to Ireland.  The meetings with the EBA have in addition sought to determine the needs of the Authority and its staff, after they are relocated from London.  </p>  <p>  Also, Minister Murphy met with Vice President Dombrovskis (Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union) in March.  The issue of the EBA was raised by the Minister who outlined the benefits of Dublin as a location for the Authority.  </p>  <p>  I would point out, that the European Commission launched a public consultation on the operations of the European Supervisory Authorities (European Banking Authority, European Securities and Markets Authority and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) on the 21st of March.  It is expected a legislative proposal from the Commission will follow in due course.  </p>  <p>  In the consultation the Commission challenges the structure of the European Supervisory Authorities, which currently mirrors the traditional tripartite nature of the financial industry.  It has raised the question of whether there are potential benefits from merging the EBA with EIOPA, which is based in Frankfurt.  </p>  <p>  Due to this uncertainty surrounding the future of the EBA, it is unlikely a final decision on its location will be made in the near future.  A decision may only be made once the legislative proposal on reforming the European Supervisory Authorities has been agreed. </p>  <p>  As the timeline for a decision is not immediate and will be dependent on the outcome of the Public consultation, I do not consider any need to engage external consultancy firms at this stage to support our bid for the EBA.  The resources currently available in my Department are sufficient to manage the process.</p></reply>

This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that this initial assessment of all schools has been used to extend DEIS supports to those schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage as detailed in the list of schools published on 13th February.  This represents a first step in the application of the new DEIS Identification process and we are moving to support pupils in those schools with effect from September 2017.  </p>  <p>  We must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since the list of the current schools included within DEIS were evaluated.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.</p><p>The self-assessed Charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the Charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid.</p><p>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge.  The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities.  If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014.  As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013.  In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen.</p><p>Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect NPPR charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted.  The guidelines, which are available at , encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases.  It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners.  In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.  All non-compliant owners or owners with queries should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make any outstanding payments.</p><p>Should an initial claim of hardship be rejected by a local authority, the claimant should also be afforded, if requested, a further appeal to a more senior officer in the local authority.  Ultimately, should a subsequent appeal be unsuccessful the complainant should be notified as early as is possible.  Claimants should also be informed that if they are still not happy with the determination they can appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

It will also be empowered to drive a national research, education and public information programme to highlight the role and benefit of planning.</p>  <p>  In establishing the OPR, the Government&rsquo;s aim is to ensure proper oversight over the systems and procedures used by planning authorities and ensure public confidence in the delivery of quality outcomes, while avoiding overlap with existing appeals procedures in relation to individual cases operated by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the role of the Courts.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for planning policy remains with the local government system, working within the legislative and policy framework for planning established at the national level.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for &ldquo;strategic planning of transport&rdquo; and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has responsibility for delivering transport infrastructure, in line with strategic transport planning.  These are very clear and distinct roles, with their own broad legislative and policy framework governing their functions.</p>  <p>  In preparing its Transport Strategy, the NTA is required to have regard to a number of matters, including the National Spatial Strategy (soon to be replaced by the National Planning Framework (NPF) currently being developed), local authority development plans, and the Regional Planning Guidelines for the regions.</p>  <p>  In addition, the NTA is required by law to ensure that the Transport Strategy is consistent with the Regional Planning Guidelines and subsequently with their replacement plans, the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, which will take account of the new NPF.</p>  <p>  It is not proposed that the OPR will have any function to review strategic transport plans drafted by the NTA or TII, nor will it have a specific statutory power to ask those bodies to alter elements of their plans.  These bodies are already bound to develop their strategies in line with the National Spatial Strategy but it is acknowledged that a much more integrated approach needs to be developed between planning and transport.  Existing legislation seeks to achieve this by requiring, on a statutory basis, consistency between strategic transport planning, in the form of the Transport Strategy, and regional level land use planning.  It is considered unnecessary to give further statutory functions to the OPR, given that statutory obligations already exist and better integration will be promoted by co-operation and collaboration between policy makers, the OPR, NTA and TII in practice, to ensure that cohesive land use planning and transport provision are achieved.</p></reply>

It was open to all local authorities to apply for funding towards the capital cost of public infrastructure, which, when provided, would secure the early delivery of additional housing at considerable scale and more affordable price points, with developments in excess of 500 units in the Dublin area, or in excess of 200 units in areas outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  Twenty-one local authorities submitted a total of 74 proposals in October 2016. On 28 March 2017, I announced funding for 34 projects under LIHAF. The cost of these projects is &euro;226.46 million, of which &euro;169.65 million would be funded under LIHAF with local authorities funding the remaining &euro;56.81 million. These public infrastructure projects will be key to the delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years, with a longer term projection of up to 70,000 units as the selected sites are fully built out.  </p>  <p>  South Dublin County Council received approval for infrastructure projects at Adamstown, Corkagh Grange and Clonburris.  The total cost of these projects is &euro;27.39 million, of which &euro;20.54 million will be funded by my Department and South Dublin County Council will provide &euro;6.85 million. Drawdown of the funding will take place in the period to 2019.  These projects are expected to deliver 3,000 housing units by 2021 and have the potential to support 11,500 housing units in the longer term, once the sites are fully built out.</p></reply>

This comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure.</p><p>Under Pillar 2 of Rebuilding Ireland, my Department is working closely with all local authorities in relation to increasing and accelerating the delivery of a range of social housing programmes and supports, including rapid build homes.</p><p>At the end of 2016, across all four Dublin Local Authorities, a total of 350 rapid build homes were advancing through various stages of delivery, including construction, with 22 rapid build homes being delivered and occupied in 2016.  A further 650 rapid build homes will be advanced in 2017, with another 500 units to be delivered in 2018.  Sites for rapid build schemes are currently being identified in Louth, Wicklow, Kildare, Meath, Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick.</p><p>There has been significant pressure to ramp-up rapid build delivery, which local authorities have been responding to positively.  Of particular note is the establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement, which means that local authorities across the country will be able to run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid build projects to site more efficiently and effectively.</p><p>My Department has published a comprehensive status list of all social housing construction schemes that are advancing nationwide, as at end-Quarter 4 of 2016. Over 500 approved schemes were listed that, when completed, will deliver some 8,500 new social homes.  The schemes listed range from those that are being designed, through to those currently on site and those completed in 2016.  It showed that just over 650 new social houses were built in 2016 and a further 90 schemes, delivering over 1,800 newly built social houses, went on site last year.  I have also continued to approve further schemes which will add to the already strong pipeline. The status list is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Other actions are underway by local authorities to respond to housing need and meet the needs of homeless people within their areas.  These include targeted acquisitions, the new Repair and Leasing initiative and the range of current funded programmes, such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme, Housing Assistance Payment and various leasing arrangements under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme.  Again, properties sourced under these programmes are used to accommodate persons on the local authority housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation or at risk of homelessness.</p><p>While the construction programme is being advanced, I have also strongly supported local authorities in the acquisition of new and previously owned houses/apartments.  In 2016, I provided over &euro;175 million to local authorities for such acquisitions and these approaches are delivering early solutions for people in need of social housing.</p><p>Details on the number of properties constructed and purchased by all local authorities for letting to those on their social housing waiting lists are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>Information on the full year of 2016 is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</p><p>The results of the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments carried out in 2016 show that there were 91,600 households on local authority housing waiting lists as at 21 September 2016.  This figure represents an increase of 1,728 households, or 1.9%, on the 89,872 households recorded in the last summary which was carried out in May 2013.  The results of the 2016 Summary are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>In line with the commitment under Social Housing Strategy 2020, statutory summaries of social housing assessments are now being carried out on an annual basis, rather than every three years as was the case in the past.  These regular summaries will provide up-to-date and comprehensive data on the numbers of households qualified for social housing support on an on-going basis and will ensure that social housing supports delivered continue to match the variable profile of those in need.</p><p>While a very significant amount of work has been carried out since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland in July 2016, I recognise the significant further progress required to activate additional housing development sites and accelerate delivery, increasing supply to the scale required, i.e. 25,000 homes per annum by 2021.  The indicators, however, are positive and the latest residential commencements and completions data show that house-building activity is continuing to grow.  Completions for the 12 month-period to end January 2017 stood at 15,256 homes, an 18% increase year on year.  Likewise, commencement notices for 13,334 new homes were submitted in the 12-month period to end January 2017, an increase of 44% year on year.  Importantly, multi-unit developments (i.e. developments other than one-off houses) currently represent 69% of all housing commencements (up from 60% in 2015).  My expectation is that some 18,000 homes will be completed nationally this year.</p><p>Building on the early actions taken to make affordable housing more viable through re-affirming apartment guidelines and reforming the development contribution regime, a number of other actions are underway to make residential property delivery viable, at a far greater scale, and at more generally affordable prices and rents.  For example, the announcement, on 28 March 2017, of &euro;226 million funding for housing infrastructure on 34 high-impact sites, through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), will act at the catalyst for the delivery of  some 23,000 homes by 2021 and an overall figure of up to 70,000 homes in the next ten to fifteen years in areas of greatest supply constraints.  Details of the projects approved under LIHAF, including those located in the four Dublin local authority areas and in Louth, Meath and Kildare County Councils, can be accessed at the following link: .</p><p>Through the range of actions currently being progressed under Rebuilding Ireland, to increase the supply of homes across all tenures, the Government will create the conditions required for the restoration of a more sustainable and normally functioning housing market, capable of providing homes, to buy or rent, at more affordable price points, where and when they are required.</p></reply>

It was open to all local authorities to apply for funding towards the capital cost of  public infrastructure, which, when provided, would secure the early delivery of additional housing at considerable scale and at more affordable price points, with developments in excess of 500 units in the Dublin area, or in excess of 200 units in areas outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  21 local authorities submitted a total of 74 proposals in October 2016. Kildare County Council submitted 7 proposals in respect of Naas, Kildare, Maynooth, Newbridge, Celbridge, Leixlip and Sallins.  On 28 March 2017, I announced funding for 34 projects under the LIHAF.  The cost of these projects is &euro;226.46 million, of which &euro;169.65 million would be funded under LIHAF with local authorities funding the remaining &euro;56.81 million.  These public infrastructure projects will be key to the delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years, with a longer term projection of up to 70,000 units as the selected sites are fully built out.</p>  <p>  Kildare County Council has received approval for the proposals at Maynooth, Naas and Sallins.  The total cost of these projects is &euro;21.43 million, of which &euro;16.07 million will be funded by my Department with Kildare County Council providing the balance of &euro;5.36 million.  These projects are expected to deliver 1,850 housing units by 2021 and have the potential to provide 4,850 housing units in the longer term, with a strong focus on affordability.  The resultant significant increase in private housing supply from these sites will facilitate increased social housing through the 10% Part V social housing dividend.  The overall increase in supply should also help ease the pressure on rented accommodation and facilitate efforts to provide social housing through existing measures such as the Housing Assistance Payment scheme.</p>  <p>  I am seeking additional funding for LIHAF under the Mid-term Review of the Capital Plan 2016-2021, but it will be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider in the context of other demands for the  available funds.  In the event that more funds are secured, local authorities will be able to re-submit proposals that did not receive funding or to advance other new proposals that would meet LIHAF objectives.</p></reply>

The Guidelines also aim to ensure that sites being developed for rural housing are suitable with regard to access and wastewater disposal, and also from landscape and design perspectives.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for individual planning authorities to prepare their development plans and the policies contained within such plans, taking account of local and varying geographical and landscape circumstances, as well as the approaches set out under the Guidelines in relation to rural-generated housing.  It is also a matter for planning authorities, as well as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to implement the Guidelines and local planning policies in assessing and deciding on individual planning applications and appeals under the development management consent process.</p>  <p>  My Department maintains a constant overview of the practical implementation of all statutory planning guidelines, including the 2005 Rural Housing Guidelines.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's key priority is delivering upon the commitments contained in its Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which collectively aim to accelerate the delivery of housing in key areas of demand, particularly in the major urban areas.</p>  <p>  With regard to housing requirements that, from a planning policy point of view, are considered to be best facilitated in an urban setting, I am confident that the broad array of policy measures this Government is taking will ensure that such requirements can be met within the fabric of our cities, towns and villages, avoiding a repeat of past mistakes when rural areas in the vicinity of our cities and towns developed in a haphazard, uncoordinated manner, with consequent adverse implications for the amenities and environment of those areas and strategic infrastructure provision.</p></reply>

These reforms provide greater certainty around the timeframes for such proposals, including proposals for social housing projects and infrastructure servicing both public and private development.</p>  <p>  In relation to assisting people to stay in their homes, this Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes, where possible.  In this regard, there are currently two Mortgage to Rent (MTR) schemes funded by my Department.  One scheme facilitates a local authority in acquiring ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  The second scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  Both schemes are part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  Both schemes target only the most acute arrears cases where a mortgage is clearly unsustainable and the household have very limited options, if any, to provide for itself.</p>  <p>  To support the ambitious Rebuilding Ireland target of 47,000 new social housing units, I have secured &euro;5.35 billion in Exchequer investment over the period to 2021.  This comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure.</p>  <p>  I am committed to tackling the range of challenges in the housing sector.  The publication of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan underpins this resolve and has seen a new level of ambition on housing.  I am confident that the multi-stranded actions involved represent a well-judged and comprehensive response to the urgent need for social housing and to respond to the need for a significant increase in housing supply generally.</p></reply>

A first-time buyer unable to get a loan from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  A local authority mortgage is an annuity mortgage with variable interest rates, so repayments will go up and down in line with interest rate changes.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012.</p><p>Key eligibility criteria provide that a loan applicant must be a first-time buyer and must be able to show their local authority that they cannot get a loan from a bank or building society.  Also, the gross income (before tax) of a single-income household in the previous year must be &euro;50,000 or less and the combined gross income (before tax) of a two-income household in the previous year must be &euro;75,000 or less.  Prospective applicants should contact their relevant local authority for further information.</p><p>The second option is the Home Choice Loan, which is available for first-time buyers to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home and will be of interest to those earning above the income limits for the standard annuity loan.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to the Home Choice Loan are set out in the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009.  Home Choice provides a loan of up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  The loan is a normal capital and interest bearing mortgage which is repaid on a monthly basis.  Home Choice Loan offers one variable interest rate.  The rate is currently set at 3.25% variable, APR 3.3%.  Further information is available at<i>.</i></p><p>To support local authorities in operating their housing loan schemes in a consistent and efficient manner, the Housing Agency provides a central underwriting service to local authorities.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the relevant statutory Credit Policy that underpins the scheme to ensure prudent lending.</p><p>The Credit Policy that underpins both house purchase loan schemes was introduced in 2009 and adherence to the requirements of the Credit Policy since then has ensured that the risk of borrowers defaulting on mortgages has been reduced.  It is imperative that local authority lending is sustainable and protects prospective borrowers from drawing down unsustainable mortgages.</p></reply>

As indicated in the reply of 19 January 2017, such households may be eligible for a mortgage from their local authority, in cases where the gross income (before tax) is &euro;50,000 or less for a single income household or &euro;75,000 or less in the case of a double income household.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.

The funding for the scheme was increased this year, as part of Budget 2017, by an additional &euro;5.7 million (almost 14% over the previous year&rsquo;s allocation) which will benefit over 50,000 children.  For the current academic year, 2016/2017, some &euro;44 million has been allocated to schools under the scheme. </p>  <p>  In recent years priority for new applications for funding had been given to schools which are part of the DEIS programme.

A further 21 DEIS schools have joined the scheme this academic year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 funding also provides for the inclusion in the scheme, from September 2017, of up to 245 new schools and 47,000 children.  This includes support to schools being brought into DEIS for the first time and the extension of the scheme to breakfast clubs in non-DEIS schools, which is the first time in many years that increased payments will be provided outside of DEIS.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-06a.481.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040600063#WRM01300"><p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition), which had been available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  </p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  </p>  <p>  Reversing this measure would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of the gross cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to increase over time.  The cost of reversing this decision would depend, therefore, on the effective date of such a measure, and also on any resultant changes in behaviour.</p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.</p>  <p>  There is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. If you require any further assistance with this query please do not hesitate to contact Philip in my office.</p></reply>

For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.</p>  <p>  There is no current legislation which prohibits married women for signing for credits.

Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018.  There are currently approximately 1,880 people in receipt of the scheme, for which Government has provided over &euro;4 million in 2017.  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.</p><p>It is expected that over the remaining period MIS customers will continue to exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies including the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.  In line with all schemes administered by my Department, any further extension of the MIS scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context. </p><p>I want to advise the Deputy that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  </p><p>The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped almost 3,400 such borrowers.  </p><p>Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.  The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,400 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.</p><p>In 2016, a further initiative was announced by Government, known as <i>Abhaile</i>.  This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  To date, approximately 5,600 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of over 3,460 principle private residences.  </p><p>I am continuing to monitor the supports and services which the Department has put in place to assist homeowners in serious mortgage arrears.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Class S (self-employed contributions) do not count. The Relevant Tax Year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which you make your claim.  So, for claims made in 2017, the Relevant Tax Year is 2015.</p><p>The employment condition requires that the carer must have been employed for at least 16 hours each week in 8 out of the 26 weeks before the period of care is due to start.</p><p>My department received an application for CARB from the person concerned on 26 November 2014.  The application was disallowed on the grounds that the PRSI conditions were not satisfied.  Although the person concerned has paid 156 reckonable contributions, he last paid them in 1984/85.</p><p>The person concerned was notified on 3 February 2015 of this decision, the reason for it and of his right of review and appeal and he was advised of his potential entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA).  An application for CA also issued.</p><p>An application for CA was received from him on 15 January 2016.  This application was disallowed on the grounds that his means were not less than the statutory limit.  He was notified on 27 July 2016 of this decision, the reason for it and of his right of review and appeal.  No review or appeal request has been received to date.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In recognition of the vital role played by the voluntary community, my Department operates a Voluntary Work Option for customers on the Jobseeker schemes.  </p><p>Customers engaged with the JobPath Service may avail of the voluntary work option provided they continue to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Customers must remain engaged with the JobPath Service while participating in voluntary work where they will continue to receive intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment and to assist them in finding full-time sustainable jobs.  The JobPath Providers will facilitate their appointments as appropriate. While voluntary work may provide long-term unemployed people with part-time experience, it is not sustainable employment. </p><p>Voluntary work normally involves only a few hours a day or a few days a week and examples in which jobseekers may engage include: </p><p>-helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disability </p><p>-assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations, local resident associations </p><p>-  All decisions determining whether the customer may take up the voluntary work will be taken by an official of my Department.  </p><p>I hope that clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is defined as requiring from another person, continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to him or herself, and being likely to require that level of care for at least twelve months.</p>  <p>  The evidence, including a medical report, submitted in support of the application for CA for the mother of the person concerned was examined and the deciding officer decided that this evidence was insufficient to show that the requirement for full-time care and attention was satisfied.</p>  <p>  There was no medical evidence submitted in support of the application for CA for the father of the person concerned.  On 14 February 2017 a medical report was issued to be completed by a medical practitioner in respect of the father of the person concerned.  To date it has not been returned.</p>  <p>  It is also a condition for receipt of CA that the carer provides full-time care and attention.  A person can be considered to be providing full-time care and attention where they are engaged in employment, self-employment or on training courses outside the home for a maximum of 15 hours per week, provided that they can show to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that adequate care has been provided for the care recipient in their absence.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was requested on 27 February 2017 to provide evidence to show that she was working outside the home for less than 15 hours per week.  The required documents and evidence were not provided, which meant the deciding officer could not determine if the condition regarding the provision of full time care and attention was satisfied.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was notified on 29 March 2017 of the disallowance of the applications for CA for both her parents, the reasons for it and of her right of review and appeal.  If the person concerned now provides the requested information, the entitlement to CA will be re-examined.</p>  <p>  Entitlement to CA is determined on evidence supplied and is never made solely on the age of an applicant. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for the delivery of public health community and home care supports at local level, including the Home Care Package (HCP) scheme.  The HCP scheme is an administrative scheme, operated by the HSE.  CA can be paid in cases where a HCP is in place.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People announced in January that a consultation process is to be launched in the coming months with a view to establishing a new statutory homecare scheme.  The consultation process will allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families and health care workers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, the long-term nature of the financial commitments arising under PPPs require that the use of such arrangements must be carefully planned in order to ensure that they are used to address infrastructural needs in a manner that is sustainable in the long term and which the public finances can afford.</p>  <p>  It was for this reason that the Government introduced an Investment Policy Framework for PPPs in 2015.  The purpose of the framework was to set a limit on the extent to which the annual costs of PPPs would pre-commit capital funding available to future Governments for investment purposes, in terms of the overall aggregate Exchequer capital allocation projected to be available in any individual year.</p>  <p>  The framework applies to the future cost of unitary payment charges in respect of both existing PPPs already in place and new PPPs currently in procurement or planning, together with the up-front Exchequer costs associated with procuring the planned new PPPs.  The current requirement is that, taken together, such future costs in respect of PPPs should not pre-commit more than 10% of the overall aggregate capital funding projected to be available to future Governments in any individual year.</p>  <p>  In the context of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan, I have asked my Department to consider  the scope for further use of PPPs to complement the direct provision of infrastructure using Exchequer funding, on a basis that is sustainable and affordable in the long term.  A senior level group has been established, comprising relevant officials from the Departments with experience of procuring projects by PPP, together with the Department of Finance, the National Development Finance Agency and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, to review past experience of PPPs and to provide an evidence based analysis of the potential for further use of PPPs (and concessions) as a procurement option for the delivery of capital infrastructure.  The terms of reference of this Group includes consideration of existing PPP guidance and governance which encompasses the investment policy framework for PPPs set out above.</p></reply>

The complete data on public works contracts is held by the contracting authority concerned.  It is the responsibility of individual contracting authorities to publish contract award notices following the signing of a contract.  This process is facilitated through the national eProcurement portal , which is managed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).</p><p>Under EU Directives on public procurement public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria.  For works contracts the current threshold is &euro;5.225 million.  The EU Directives require contract award notices for contracts above this threshold to be published in the OJEU following the award of the contract.  The publication of contract award notices is made possible by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) through eTenders which automatically forwards award notices to the OJEU for publication.  Circular 10/14 issued by my Department requires public bodies since 1 August 2014 to publish all contract award notices over &euro;25,000 on eTenders.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, that has been input by contracting authorities onto the eTenders portal, is being collated by the OGP but will not be available within the time allowed.  The information will issue directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The present winter opening hours are 9-4:30pm on weekdays and 10-4:30pm on weekends and public holidays.  In summer, weekday opening hours extend till 5pm and weekends to 6pm.  Winter closing is predicated by day length and summer closing by the end of the working day for staff.  Opening at weekends requires that a minimum number of staff are on duty to oversee the collections and the glasshouses as well as the safety of the visiting public.</p>  <p>  Whilst the Gardens do provide an important public amenity, they are also a scientific collection.  Unlike a public park such a collection requires greater oversight, of which the care and attention given to plants on a daily basis is very different to how other parks are managed.  This is due to both the rarity of some of the specimens, but also on account of legal undertakings made with donor countries and institutions, which are governed by the Nagoya Protocol to which Ireland is a signatory (since 2012).</p>  <p>  There are restrictions on certain activities in the Gardens, including picnicking, running, cycling, ball games and dog walking all of which are incompatible with the scientific and conservation aspects of the collection.  These activities are catered for in the numerous surrounding public parks; which include Griffith Park, Tolka Valley Park, Johnstown Park and Albert College Park.  These latter parks stay open later than the National Botanic Gardens and include playgrounds and a diversity of places to walk and relax.</p></reply>

The cable lands in Killala County Mayo and interconnects New York, Dublin and London.  Aqua Comms is a provider of data connectivity and bandwidth infrastructure services for content providers, cloud-based networks, data centres, IT companies and the global media.  Its network will be used by major multinational technology and telecoms companies to provide fast, secure data connections between Ireland, the US and UK and will enable the continued growth of the Irish digital economy.</p>  <p>  - ISIF also rolled an existing (National Pensions Reserve Fund) commitment in daa plc's public bond, which was issued in 2008 (repayable in 2018), into a &euro;35 million commitment in a new 2028 public bond issuance by daa, the operator of Dublin and Cork Airports.  This continues ISIF's role as a long-term, strategic, domestic investor in daa. Given the nature of the underlying business of daa, and the fact that the new bond issuance provides the underpinning long-term financing for the company, the ISIF commitment to the 2028 bond is considered suited to inclusion under the Connectivity Fund.</p>  <p>  I understand that several other Connectivity Fund investment opportunities are currently being assessed under the ISIF's "double bottom line" mandate, which is to seek both commercial return and economic impact.  These connectivity opportunities include potential investments in energy, air, sea and further data connectivity projects and businesses seeking to expand and enhance Ireland's international links.</p></reply>

One of the priorities that I highlighted was the need to strengthen incentives for providers to effectively respond to unmet health care needs by ramping up Activity Based Funding (ABF).</p>  <p>  An ABF system is currently being introduced in public acute hospitals on a phased basis.  The introduction of ABF represents a fundamental change in how healthcare is funded in Ireland.  Implementation of the funding model involves moving away from inefficient block grant budgets to a new system where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity undertaken, subject to budgetary limits.  As such, there will be a fundamental shift from funding facilities and settings to instead funding episodes of care.  Other key benefits from the introduction of ABF include increased fairness in resource allocation, improved efficiency and increased transparency.    </p>  <p>  January 2016 represented a major milestone in the implementation process because the ABF system was introduced for inpatient and daycase activity in the 38 largest public hospitals.  This means that hospitals are now being incentivised to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving their performance targets while remaining within their overall budgetary ceilings.  By operating more efficiently, hospitals will have the opportunity to maximise the delivery of activity within their overall budgetary ceilings, thereby helping to tackle waiting lists and address unmet need.  </p>  <p>  While the implementation of ABF is currently focused on inpatient and daycase activity, the Government is clear that journey must not end there.  Instead, it is vital that the funding model continually evolves so as to create the correct incentives for the delivery of optimal care for the Irish population while avoiding the introduction of perverse incentives.  For this reason, the ABF model will continue to evolve on a phased basis over the coming years to encompass other aspects of hospital services, such as outpatient activity, before extending into community services.  This is being done in order to incentivise the delivery of care in the most appropriate settings.  As part of the process of achieving this objective, my Department is engaging with the HSE in relation to the development of a framework for costing community care services.  </p>  <p>  I am also committed to using the ABF model to incentivise other health system objectives such as improving the quality of care and integration of care across different settings.  During the implementation process, my Department and the HSE will continue to learn from the experiences both of our own system and other jurisdictions in order to ensure the effective implementation of this important reform.</p></reply>

The Department has identified a targeted action to scale up effective community based programmes with a focus on disadvantaged areas to enhance knowledge and skills with regard to healthy eating and active living. (Action 9.2) In conjunction with the Health Service Executive, it is recommended that special emphasis be placed on providing guidance, advice and training to parents on healthy food and healthy eating. The Health Service Executive has already developed and is implementing two projects &lsquo;Cook It &lsquo; and &lsquo;Healthy Food Made Easy&rsquo; both of which focus on healthy eating and healthy cooking for disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  In addition, Agri Aware&rsquo;s programme Incredible Edibles, which comes with the backing of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills, is a healthy eating initiative for Primary School pupils. It encourages schools across the country to get busy growing carrots, lettuce, potatoes, strawberries, turnips and herbs. Schools are supplied with grow packs, activity sheets and videos containing everything needed to grow these healthy foods.</p></reply>

To help achieve this the Department is engaging with a range of stakeholders looking at models of good practice.</p>  <p>  My Department is already linking in with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the Food Dudes Programme, a programme that is managed by Bord Bia and receives financial support from the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine and the European Union through the School Fruit Scheme.</p>  <p>  Food Dudes encourages children to eat more fruit and vegetables both in school and at home. The Programme has been shown to be effective and results long lasting across the primary age range, regardless of gender, school size, geographic and socio-economic factors.</p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the Department of Social Protection developing national Nutrition Standards for their School Meals Local Projects Scheme which provides funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children. This Scheme provides funding directly from the Department of Social Protection to primary schools, secondary schools and local groups and voluntary organisations which operate their own school meals projects.</p>  <p>  The School Meals Local Projects Scheme aims to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, by reason of lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them.  Research has shown that inadequate nutrition impacts negatively on children&rsquo;s ability to learn and benefit from education.  Proper nutrition can improve children&rsquo;s ability to concentrate, improve disruptive behaviour and encourage children to attend school.  The School Meals Local Project is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement by children, particularly those from the most disadvantaged background.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively, and it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation.</p></reply>

The Agency plays a vital role in the protection of the health of 500 million EU citizens through the scientific evaluation and safety monitoring of human and veterinary medicines.  The Government believes that Dublin would be a very suitable location for the EMA, particularly in the interests of ensuring continuity and sustainability in the conduct of its business.  Such continuity is critical for European citizens and the industries which the EMA regulates. The EMA is also key to maintaining the competitiveness of the European pharmaceutical industry, which is worth approximately &euro;260 billion annually.  The relocation of the EMA also represents an opportunity to attract a prestigious EU Agency  to Dublin which will directly employ almost 1,000 staff and attract many more high-quality jobs in associated sectors.  Its location in Dublin would also stimulate employment in ancillary sectors, including the hospitality and transport industries.</p>  <p>The Government has decided a whole-of-Government approach will be taken to promoting the relocation of the EMA to Dublin.   An interdepartmental/interagency working group led by my Department is working to prepare the strongest possible bid.  In view of the complexity of this task, the inherently competitive nature of the process by which a decision on the future location for the EMA will be made and the likelihood that the European Council will consider this matter within the coming months, it was determined that external support was needed in respect of key elements of the bid preparation and communications process.  In this context my Department recently invited tenders from a number of potential providers, seeking public relations/public affairs and communications support for the period to the end of June 2017.  The core requirement is to ensure that the Dublin bid is prepared and  presented in a professional and proactive manner which clearly sets out, to all stakeholders, why Dublin is an ideal location for the EMA.</p>  <p>  The request-for-tender document indicated that the expected total costs submitted for the tender would be in the range &euro;100,000 to &euro;120,000.   While a preferred bidder has been chosen, the tendering process is currently in the 14-day standstill period and no contract has yet been signed.  In these circumstances it would not be appropriate to name the preferred bidder at this time.</p></reply>

These veterinary inspectors are authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act (2013) and their responsibilities include  the enforcement of animal welfare legislation provided for under the Act. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na together with officers of Customs and Excise are also designated as authorised officers under the Act. Veterinary inspectors employed by the Local Authorities can also be appointed to exercise functions under the Act. In addition, the Animal Health and Welfare Act provides for the extension of authorised officer powers to non-governmental organisations (NGO) involved in animal welfare.  In this regard, Service Agreements have been entered into with the ISPCA, the DSPCA and with the Turf Club, with the result that there are now sixteen authorised officers employed by NGO&rsquo;s operating throughout the country to facilitate enforcement of the Act.  These comprise eight ISPCA Inspectors serving fifteen counties throughout the country, three DSPCA Inspectors (serving the Dublin city and county area) and five officials from the Turf Club.</p>  <p>  A feature of the enforcement of the Act is that authorised officers from NGOs at times work alongside officials of my Department and the Local Authority on certain enforcement matters, resulting in a very effective and efficient use of resources.  My Department also provides considerable financial and administrative support to assist the NGO Inspectors in carrying out their work in protecting animal welfare. In this regard, my Department provides funding of &euro;2,480,500 to 137 animal welfare organisations throughout the country. A substantial amount of this funding is allocated to the DSPCA (&euro;290,000) and the ISPCA and its affiliated organisation (in the region of almost &euro;680,000) and this significant level of support is enabling increased enforcement by the NGO authorised officers of animal welfare legislation. </p>  <p>   I am satisfied that adequate resources are being devoted to the implementation of the animal welfare provisions of the Animal Health and Welfare Act.</p></reply>

However under a limited felling licence, while the forest owner must plant the same amount of land that is being felled, he may plant at a different location or locations.  A detailed reforestation plan is submitted with every licence application and the forest owner must replant within a specified period of time, in accordance with the conditions attached to the felling licence.</p>  <p>  The reforestation plan will include the number and type of trees to be replanted, amongst other considerations.  A landowner can propose to plant the same number of trees, where for example a small number of trees are being removed along with a hedgerow.  </p>  <p>  However, where a forest block is being felled, under a Limited Felling Licence, there is a strong likelihood that the applicant will plant a higher number of trees.  If a mature forest block is being felled there may be only 500 trees per hectare present, with the balance of the original stocking removed during previous thinning operations.  The alternative lands being afforested will have 2,500 trees per hectare where conifer trees are being planted or, 3,300 trees per hectare for broadleaves.</p>  <p>  Replanting following felling is a legal obligation and therefore failure to replant according to the conditions on a licence may result in legal proceedings against the licence holder.  It should be noted also that if land is sold after felling, the replanting obligation falls to the new landowner.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Department is to increase forest cover from 10.5% to 18% by 2046, through the reforestation of existing forest lands and the annual afforestation plan.  Sustainable forest management and, in particular, a robust replanting policy are vital to achieving this long-term aim.  Under the new Forestry Act, which will shortly be commenced, there will be a single licensing system.  The obligation to prepare and comply with a reforestation plan will remain and a replanting order may be sought where a landowner fails to reforest after felling.  </p></reply>

There are market opportunities for animal exports which are separate from and additional to opportunities for meat and meat product exports. The Deputy can be assured that both I and my Department will make every effort to promote and maintain an environment in which live exports can take place in both an economic and sustainable manner, with due regard for the welfare of all animals exported. </p>  <p>  In Ireland  we implement strong controls is respect of the welfare of animals being exported. For instance, we have a comprehensive legislative framework in place for the transport of animals by sea, set out in the Carriage of Livestock by Sea Regulations 2016 (S.I. 356 of 2016). Irish legislative standards for sea transport are higher than those which apply in other EU Member States and are recognised by the EU Commission as being amongst the most effective and stringent legislation in force as regards transport by sea. Only ships approved by my Department can load cattle for export from Ireland.  Cattle being exported are monitored during the prescribed isolation period by Veterinary Inspectors from my Department and by Official Veterinarians from the importing countries. This is in addition to work carried out by Private Veterinary Practitioners who carry out the testing required prior to export to enable certification. Animals are inspected and certified as regards health status and fitness for travel before being loaded and whilst on board livestock vessels departing from Ireland. In addition due regard is taken to weather conditions in respect of long distance transport and at times my Department makes arrangements to have veterinary assessment during transport and at point of arrival.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the reports referred to. Animal welfare standards in Ireland and in Europe are recognised to be amongst the best in the world. We will continue to work closely with the people involved in the live export business, with other EU Member States and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), with a view to improving animal welfare (including slaughter) practices worldwide.</p></reply>

This EU funding is supplemented by exchequer funding bringing the total allocation to some &euro;4 billion.</p><p>The annual breakdown of total EU support under the Rural Development Programme for Ireland is set out in annex 1 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 &ndash; see table 1.  The annual breakdown of EAFRD funding is only made at aggregate level and is not transferred down to measure/sub-measure level (or scheme level).</p><p>If the amount of EAFRD expenditure drawn down in a calendar year is less than the annual breakdown, the difference between the actual EAFRD expenditure and the annual breakdown may be reviewed without changing the overall EAFRD allocation for the period.

In November 2016, the European Commission published a proposal for a new Renewables Directive that envisages an overall European Union renewable energy target of at least 27% in 2030.  It is proposed in the draft Directive that the amount of energy from crop based biofuels which can be counted towards renewable transport targets in the period after 2020 will be progressively reduced to 3.8% in 2030.</p>  <p>  Biofuel production and its use, unless properly regulated, may not deliver required greenhouse gas savings and could impact negatively on food production and land use.  It is important, therefore, that measures are in place to mitigate against environmental risks, such as Indirect Land-Use Change, of certain categories of biofuels.  It is also important that the development of advanced biofuels, which pose little risk of ILUC, are encouraged and measures to incentivise the production of these biofuels are contained in the ILUC Directive and the proposed new Renewables Directive.</p>  <p>  I anticipate the ILUC Directive will be transposed into Irish legislation by my Department by the deadline of 10 September 2017.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>On the 4th April, I formally published  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .  The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:  </p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The updated map indicates that parts of the townland of Kilbrean Beg falls within the Blue area and  will be covered by commercial operators while the remaining part of the townland will fall within the State Intervention under the NBP.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at . </p><p>With the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map the State Intervention Area has now been finalised.  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme. </p></reply>

Developed through consultation with a wide range of stakeholders from across the public sector, and approved by Government, the Strategy establishes a new governance structure to ensure senior leadership on energy management across the public sector.  The Strategy also provides clarification that public sector bodies can retain the financial savings made from energy efficiency for re-investment in further energy saving activity or their provision of public services. </p>  <p>  I have allocated &euro;5m in 2017 for two partnership programmes between the SEAI and the OPW and Department of Education and Skills.  These projects will fund replicable, pathfinder projects in the central government property portfolio and in schools.  The SEAI is also providing technical assistance to all public sector bodies to establish a central project pipeline, and provide enhanced project development assistance, across the public sector to facilitate coordinated decision making on investment in public sector energy efficiency to 2020.</p></reply>

Responsibility for soil, and in particular soil contamination, rests across a range of Government Departments and State Agencies depending on the particular issue.  For example, soil contamination has relevance to agriculture, biodiversity, industry, human and animal health, water quality, bogs, and the environment generally, as well as having potential impacts on climate change.Indeed, an exercise undertaken in my Department in 2016 identified some 35 strategic initiatives and binding measures that currently apply to soil quality in Ireland. </p><p>The issue of soil protection, including its legislative framework, is kept under review by the relevant responsible Departments and Agencies, and through various fora, particularly in the light of national, EU and international developments in the area of soil policy.  My Department, as well as other Departments and Agencies, participate in these national and international discussions.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency is today hosting the &ldquo;End of Waste Network&rdquo; meeting in Dublin, where  soil is amongst the items on the agenda for discussion.</p><p>Once waste has been classified as hazardous, its treatment and management is subject to the Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations 2004, which govern the process under which waste licences are applied for and maintained.  Once granted, each waste licence defines the nature of environmentally acceptable activities that can take place at a waste facility, including the acceptable types of waste that can be received.  This is done by the conditions of the licence which are set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). </p><p>Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in specific cases, by a local authority or the EPA of their statutory functions under the Act.  However, the EPA publishes comprehensive information on its licensees  which is available at .  Further information is also available from the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Sustainability at .</p></reply>

Wetland management chiefly relates to the rewetting, rehabilitation or restoration of wetlands, and Ireland accounts for mitigation action within some wetlands which fall within currently reported land types (e.g. forested areas).  However, under UNFCCC reporting rules, the specific inclusion of wetlands as a distinct land category is limited to organic soils not reported elsewhere within national greenhouse gas emissions inventories.  This restricts its potential role to lands which are largely former or active peat extraction areas, degraded near-natural areas or otherwise abandoned organic soils.  The management of these lands falls across a number of Departments, and a number of public and private agencies. </p>  <p>  In relation to the potential mitigation capability of wetland areas, it should be noted that global experience in the tracking and reporting of climate mitigation measures is limited at present.  Owing to the diversity of wetlands, research is needed on the measurement, mitigation and development of national emission factors.  The Government, through the Environmental Protection Agency, continues to direct research funding to improve our understanding of carbon stock changes in peatlands and agricultural soils in order to contribute to the development of a more robust inventory and underpin future accounting for these categories. </p>  <p>  I am open to considering further work on this topic in the context of the National Mitigation Plan, building on the research already undertaken.</p></reply>

The NTFSO has also carried out inspections of the facilities where the contaminated material was originally processed and has met with the waste broker concerned with a view to improving the broker&rsquo;s inspection and monitoring procedures in order to reduce the risk of repeated incidents in the future.  Since July 2015, it has been a condition of waste collection permits that collectors must accept a minimum list of recyclable materials.  It is recognised that the co-mingled recycling bin can be contaminated with non-recyclable items due to a number of factors including awareness of what can or cannot be recycled on behalf of the household customer.  To improve awareness rates, I have allocated funding of &euro;1.6 million in 2017 towards a national waste campaign.  </p>  <p>  This public information campaign, which is being developed by the 3 Regional Waste Management Planning Offices (RWMPOs) has already begun a brown bin programme to encourage households to (i) prevent food waste and (ii) deal with unavoidable food and organic waste more effectively.  The RWMPOs will roll out further elements of a national education and awareness campaign as the year progresses which will highlight the environmental cost of contaminating your recycling bin and provide information to householders on preparing their waste and ensuring it is placed in the correct bin.</p>  <p>  In a private market, waste collectors also have a responsibility and incentive to engage with their customers to make it clear what materials are acceptable in each bin.  Likewise the facilities which receive this material are effectively gatekeepers in terms of  quality.  Certain household waste collection companies have indicated that they are introducing penalties on householders who consistently contaminate bins and it is open to other companies to do the same.</p></reply>

According to the CSO, the overall number of overseas visits to Ireland increased by 3% year-on-year in the period December 2016 - February 2017.  Within this, there was a decrease of 5.9% in the number of overseas visits from Great Britain.  It is worth noting, however, that while the December - February 2017 figures for visits from Great Britain were down on the previous year, they were still up 14% on the same period two years earlier. ​​ In common with the rest of Government there has been deep analysis of the challenges which industry and the commercial sectors, including the tourism industry, face because of the outcome of the UK Referendum.  While it is too early to be definitive as to why there has been a reduction in visitor numbers from Great Britain, Tourism Ireland has, in the context of Brexit, highlighted the strong likelihood of a reduction in the number of British residents expected to travel abroad on holidays, including a reduction in the number expected to travel to Ireland.  A key element of Tourism Ireland's strategy since 2014 has been market diversification.   In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in Mainland Europe and North America.  In addition the depreciation of sterling against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.   Looking to the medium term, Tourism Ireland's plan for the period from 2017-2019 includes the agency's response to marketing Ireland in a more focussed manner in Great Britain in order to maximise return on marketing spend.</p>  <p>  I have forwarded the Deputy's question to Tourism Ireland for any further information they may be able to provide.

My Department's input to date into the development of the new National Planning Framework has emphasised the need for more formal integration between land use and transport planning.</p>  <p>  The National Cycle Policy Framework (NCPF) has been integrated into the Development Plans of the majority of local authorities so ensuring that the objectives and policies to support and promote cycling are taken account of in current and future planning.  In addition, the National Transport Authority (NTA) published the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) Cycle Network Plan covering the seven local authority areas in the GDA in 2013.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that the precise targets set out in the Smarter Travel policy and the NCPF were largely predicated on the availability of the substantial funding which did not transpire because of the significant scaling back in overall public investment in response to the economic and fiscal crises and priorities had to be made for the delivery of specific actions.   Nevertheless, despite this, considerable progress has been made and continues to be made in providing the infrastructure and other interventions that support modal shift.  The Department is currently undertaking a full review of the National Cycling Policy Framework and action 8.10 will form part of that work.</p>  <p>  Three towns, Limerick, Westport, and Dungarvan were awarded funding under the Smarter Travel Areas funding programme to develop smarter travel demonstration towns.  The Programme ran from 2012 to 2016 and has recently finished.

As I have repeatedly stated, the appropriate forum for resolution of this dispute is the WRC, assisted if required by the Labour Court, and I hope that both parties can use this opportunity to agree upon an acceptable and fair deal.  The Deputy is aware that I have consistently stated that I will not intervene in areas where Ministerial intervention is not appropriate and I am clear that negotiations relating to the internal organisation of a company is such an area.  However, I have acted in areas where I believe it to be appropriate to do so.  I have increased the amount of funding available for socially necessary, but financially unviable PSO services and I have committed toward further increasing that funding as resources allow.  I have instructed my Department to work with the Department of Social Protection in examining the funding associated with the Free Travel Scheme and I expect a satisfactory conclusion to that examination.  I have assured rural Ireland that the NTA has the statutory powers and resources required to ensure transport connectivity is maintained where commercial bus services are altered.  I have invited members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee to submit their views on the commercial bus licensing system and stated my willingness to consider amending current legislation in cases where improvements can be identified.  I have stated I am open to meeting all relevant stakeholders on issues relating to public transport</p>  <p>  My actions alone will not resolve this situation.  Resolution will only be possible through both management and unions agreeing upon an acceptable and fair deal and I hope that their discussions, facilitated by the WRC, will result in such a deal and that the ongoing disruption to transport services ends.</p></reply>

In accordance with the requirements of EU law, my Department provides annual capital funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network under the <i>Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract </i>(IMMAC). The current IMMAC covers the period 2014-2018 and funding of almost &euro;160 million is being provided to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann under the contract in 2017. </p><p>The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  The NTA's Transport Strategy for the GDA 2016-2035, proposes implementation of the DART Expansion Programme involving electrification of the Northern line as far as Drogheda, the Kildare Line to Hazelhatch, the Sligo line to Maynooth in the west and to the M3 Parkway and construction of the DART Underground Tunnel.The original cost of the overall DART Expansion Programme (including the tunnel element) was estimated at &euro;4bn - &euro;3bn of which was in respect of the tunnel as originally designed. </p><p>However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided in September 2015 that the tunnel element should be redesigned to provide a lower cost solution and that work is being progressed at present.  Exchequer spending to end 2014 on the tunnel project amounted to &euro;44.4 million, most of which related to design, planning and railway order costs.The work and costs incurred to date in relation to the project will have value when the redesigned project proceeds.  Almost &euro;70m has been allocated under the Capital Plan for the extension of the DART to Balbriggan and for work on the redesign of the tunnel.</p><p>The NTA's GDA strategy also proposes completion of the City Centre Re-signalling Programme (CCRP) and development of the Centralised Traffic Control Centre (CTCC) which will improve rail movements on the network.  The total cost of the CCRP Project is approximately. &euro;51m with just over &euro;30m spent to date and funding of &euro;20m allocated in the Capital Plan to complete the project by 2019.  The CTCC will cost  approx &euro;116m with approx. &euro;3m spent to date and further funding of &euro;96m allocated to the project under the Capital Plan. </p><p>The Phoenix Park Tunnel Link opened in November 2016.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  Implementation of the regional and local road improvement projects included in the Capital Plan is, therefore, the responsibility of the relevant local authority.  </p>  <p>  The eight regional and local road improvement projects mentioned by the Deputy are included in the Capital Plan. As it will be some years before funding under the Capital Plan builds up to the level required to maintain the regional and local road network in a steady state condition, expenditure continues to be primarily directed towards maintenance and renewal work.  This means that the Capital Plan upgrade projects have to be implemented on a phased basis as budgets allow and as necessary project appraisal and planning consents are obtained by the relevant local authorities.  Overall over &euro;140 million of Capital Plan funding has been earmarked for implementation of these projects, the construction of which will be subject to a competitive tender process.</p>  <p>  The project which is most advanced is the Sallins Bypass.  It has been agreed that, in the interest of economies of scale and delivery efficiency, the main design and construction elements of the Naas Bypass widening Scheme, Osberstown Interchange and Sallins Bypass Schemes are to be progressed as one construction contract.  This contract is at tender at present and Kildare County Council is the contracting authority.  Subject to the satisfactory outcome of the tender process, these projects are expected to be completed on a phased basis over 2019/2020.</p>  <p>  It is also anticipated that the construction of the road upgrades in the vicinity of GrangeCastle Business Park will go ahead this year once the procurement process is completed.  South Dublin County Council is the contracting authority.</p>  <p>  The other projects will be progressed as the necessary project and planning consents are obtained and as funding can be made available by my Department.  I can assure the Deputy  that my Department is committed to these projects and will be making funding available over the capital plan period to meet the State's commitments in relation to these schemes. </p>  <p>  As regards expenditure to date and the 2017 allocations for these projects, this information is included in the Regional and Local Roads Payment and Allocations Booklets which are available in the D&aacute;il library.</p></reply>

This is recognised and reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government where we commit to ensuring that the &euro;3.6bn investment in the public transport system provided for in the Capital Plan 2016 - 2022 will uphold the principles of <i>Smarter Travel</i>.  The Capital Plan allocates &euro;100m in funding for implementation of the S<i>marter Travel </i>policy and carbon reduction measures. Expenditure to date has been in the region of &euro;11m.  However, this does not reflect the totality of the capital funding allocated for sustainable transport more generally. Significant funding is also provided to the National Transport Authority (NTA) on an annual basis for the delivery of walking and cycling infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and the Regional Cities. This is delivered through the Regional Cities Grants Programme and the Sustainable Transport Measures Programme. &euro;28m has been allocated to these programmes for 2017. A further &euro;1.6m has been allocated in 2017  to the NTA for the delivery of the Green Schools Travel Programme by An Taisce.</p></reply>

The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.  The Capital Plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  The transport element of the Capital Plan did provide for some targeted investment in a number of new projects in the Munster region including the N8/N25 Dunkettle Interchange and the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom schemes. In addition, a number of other schemes targeted at removing bottlenecks and upgrading port access, will commence subject to necessary consents.  It was not possible to include the M20 in the Capital Plan as the scale of investment to deliver it was not affordable.  </p>  <p>  I am conscious of the potential regional development benefits of an upgrade of the Cork to Limerick link and the significant interest in finding a means to at least restart planning work on the route. In this regard I agreed to TII spending &euro;1 million to  review the status of work undertaken previously and to update certain inputs including traffic studies. However as things currently stand,  I do not have the funding available to enable this scheme to progress to full planning approval stage. I do expect that the status of the Cork to Limerick road link will be examined as part of the Review of the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  As TII is reviewing the status of work previously undertaken and is updating certain inputs including traffic studies, I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to TII for direct reply.

I am informed that approximately 65 compulsory redundancies are proposed to be made from May to August this year. I am also informed that consultations with employees are ongoing.</p>  <p>  Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2014  an employee who has over two years continuous service with an employer, has a statutory right to a redundancy payment. However, there is no legal obligation on the employer to offer terms beyond the minimum provided for in  legislation i.e. two weeks for every year of service plus a bonus week. Ex gratia payments on top of statutory redundancy are matters for negotiation between the employer and the employees.</p>  <p>  The proposed job losses will be a significant blow to the employees involved and their families. My Department remains focused on creating the most competitive environment for enterprise to succeed so that we can achieve our goal of sustainable employment for all. Working with our enterprise agencies and with colleagues across Government, we are committed to delivering a range of actions outlined in our National and Regional Action Plans for Jobs to ensure that quality and sustainable jobs continue to be created throughout all regions of the country.</p></reply>

Provisional application is a standard part of trade agreements and allows those parts of the agreement for which the EU has competence to come into force.  The provisions relating to investment protection and investment dispute settlement are excluded from provisional application.  </p>  <p>  The process of ratification can now commence in some 43 national parliaments and regional assemblies across the EU according to their constitutional requirements.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the D&aacute;il will be part of the final decision to ratify the Agreement.  </p>  <p>  I fully support provisional application of the Agreement.  I am of the view that there should be no impediment to Irish companies immediately taking advantage of the provisions of CETA including eliminating tariffs on almost all of key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, easing regulatory barriers and ensuring more transparent rules for market access.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is important to wait to see the benefits of CETA come into being, before CETA is put before the D&aacute;il for ratification.  Then we can have a fully informed, evidence based debate on the value of the Agreement to Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department is already working with our agencies and Business Groups to ensure that Irish firms take early advantage of the terms of the Agreement.  I will be leading a trade mission to Canada in late May to promote the opportunities provided by the Agreement.</p></reply>

Over the years, Ireland has developed an important pigmeat export trade to Canada and now there is potential to develop the export business for Irish beef and lamb also.  The removal of the Canadian 26.5% import tariff will be a significant factor in achieving this aim.  This means that Irish meat producers have full tariff free access to the Canadian market.  In October 2016, Meat Industry Ireland wrote to me expressing their support for the early provisional application of CETA. </p>  <p>  Beef is considered as a sensitive agricultural product in EU free trade agreements where only limited concessions are granted in the form of tariff rate quotas.  Any import of beef is subject to full compliance with EU health and safety standards including the ban on hormone treated beef.  This means that only hormone-free meat can be imported into the EU.  Ireland successfully campaigned for the EU to grant Canada a low beef tariff rate quota of 45,850 tonnes progressively over 5 years thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area.  Above this agreed quota the EU's high tariffs continue to apply.</p></reply>

Work on analysing the data from this research is well advanced, and I am considering what options, in addition to those already provided by our Agencies, might be necessary.</p>  <p>  My Department is also currently piloting research to examine the implications for the most exposed enterprise sectors - in terms of trading and economic relationships - of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union. Firm-level insights on attitudes and preparedness for Brexit are an important aspect of this study. The research will also examine the associated implications for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in terms of the freedom to invest in, own, and/or manage enterprises, and to undertake certain financial transactions. The project will run in two stages: a pilot/verification stage, and a completion stage. The pilot phase began in January, will be substantially completed shortly, and will inform the next stage which is due to be completed by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  It is not intended to publish these studies as they will be part of the deliberative process to inform the development of our policy positions as part of the negotiations on the UK future relationship with the EU.</p></reply>

IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2015-2019 includes a commitment to increase FDI in every region outside Dublin by 30%-40%. The Agency made good progress towards achieving this goal in 2016, with 52% of all jobs created by IDA Ireland's clients last year based outside of Dublin.  </p>  <p>  In 2016 IDA supported companies created an additional 41 jobs in Cavan. There are seven IDA Ireland client companies in the county collectively employing a total of 1,203 people.  Enterprise Ireland, meanwhile, supports 123 companies in Cavan that sustain a total of 5,221 jobs in the county.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that IDA Ireland actively encourages clients to locate in regional locations. The final decision, however, always lies with the company concerned and can be influenced by many different factors including access to talent, proximity to transport hubs and the suitability of local infrastructure.</p>  <p>  The Agency has informed me that their Senior Manager for Regional Development is happy to meet with Cavan County Council to discuss the issues raised in their recent letter in more detail.</p></reply>

A JLC is comprised of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in a sector.  JLCs meet regularly, under an independent Chairperson to discuss proposals for terms and conditions to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector. If agreement is reached the JLC publishes details and invites submissions from interested parties.</p>  <p>  If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration. The Labour Court will then make a decision on the adoption of the proposals. If the Court decides to adopt the proposals, a copy is presented to me and if I consider it appropriate to do so I will make an Order giving effect to the proposals. Such Orders are known as Employment Regulation Orders.</p>  <p>  The Joint Labour Committee for the Security Industry was established in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 377 of 1998 (as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 2014).</p>  <p>  I am informed that the draft proposals for a new employment regulation order for the Security Industry were in the public domain since 6th January last when they were advertised as part of the public consultation process. The closing date for submissions on those proposals was 7th February last. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Chair of the Security Industry JLC has been in contact with the members of the Committee to advise them that the proposals of the Joint Labour Committee are draft proposals which have not been adopted by the Labour Court in accordance with Section 42B (13)(c) of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 as amended and neither have they been the subject of an Employment Regulation Order made by me in accordance with Section 42C(2) of that Act. </p></reply>
