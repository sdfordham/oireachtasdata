Depending on the injuries sustained, major trauma patients can be taken to these hospitals for definitive care rather than to the Major Trauma Centre. </p>  <p>  The detailed proposed designation criteria for Trauma Units are set out in Appendix 6 of the Report of the Trauma Steering Group. </p>  <p>   Currently in Ireland, there are 16 acute hospitals that could potentially meet the designation criteria for Trauma Units. The Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore is one of these 16 hospitals. While at present these 16 hospitals all treat trauma, many of the hospitals would need further enhancement and management to meet the level of service provision required to fulfil the designation criteria for Trauma Units. </p>  <p>  The HSE has established an interim implementation group, as recommended in the Report, with Departmental representation, to commence immediate actions including recruitment of a National Clinical Lead and establishment of the National Office for Trauma Services, and selection of a Major Trauma Centre for Dublin. The group met for the first time on 12 April and continues to meet on a regular basis to consider these actions in the first instance. Detailed implementation planning will be required to fully implement the Trauma Strategy over a number of years, and will be led by the National Office for Trauma Services. </p></reply>

The project did not look at the generic services that people with dementia or their families and carers may use or the quality of the identified services. However, it offers a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area.</p>  <p>   The final report, entitled &lsquo;Dementia Specific Services in the Community: Mapping Public and Voluntary Services&rsquo;, found gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development. This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia. It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to this dementia-specific mapping project, the National Dementia Office plans to work with the Centre for Economic and Social Research on Dementia in NUI Galway to identify the range of dementia-appropriate services available nationally.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-28a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062800045#WRA01300"><p>Cork Kerry Community Healthcare recognises the long waiting times for clinical assessments within the current Assessment of Need process. A portion of the &lsquo;overdue for completion&rsquo; figure under the current AON statistics includes cases where the clinical assessment has been completed and a clinical report has been given to the families. However, the formal report from the Assessment Officer as required by legislation has not issued. Resources have been directed towards this particular piece of work since the beginning of 2018 and it is expected that the backlog of reports will be completed by Assessment Officers by year end. This will in turn reduce the overdue figures.</p>  <p>  In an effort to standardise Assessment of Need procedures and to facilitate timely assessments, the HSE identified a requirement to develop a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  This SOP is intended to replace the suite of approximately 50 guidance notes that have been issued since 2007 and will define the assessment. This will ensure a standardised approach across the state in respect of the operational application of the Disability Act 2005 and  provide an important opportunity to balance or ensure equity in terms of assessment and support interventions for vulnerable children and young people with a disability.</p>  <p>  The HSE is engaged in a consultation process through Forsa on its introduction and hopes to successfully conclude this engagement in the coming weeks prior to roll out.  </p></reply>

This recognises that an increased understanding of autism across the public sector is required to ensure that the implementation of the Plan addresses the needs of people with autism on an equal basis to other people with disabilities.</p><p>The overarching principle governing the planning and delivery of health services and supports for adults and children with disabilities including autism is that they should be integrated, as much as possible, with services and supports for the rest of the population. The Government&rsquo;s agenda in this regard is clearly set out in the current National Disability Strategy which is based on a non-condition specific approach to the delivery of public services and the mainstreaming agenda.</p><p>The Minister for Health, in 2017 asked the HSE to carry out a review of the level of supports and services to people with autism spectrum disorder. A cross divisional working group was established by the HSE, lead by Chief Officer Tony Canavan, to undertake the review. The role of the group was to examine the operational effectiveness of existing health service responses in addressing the particular needs of those with autism spectrum disorder and seek to identify models of good practice.</p><p>In conjunction with the HSE review of services,<b></b>the Department of Health carried out a review of data sources and an epidemiological study into the prevalence and future projections for Autism Spectrum disorder earlier this year.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I are currently considering the findings from both the working group and the review of research.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-28a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062800045#WRA01900"><p>Following an independent review of the need for a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford, the Herity report concluded that the needs of the effective catchment population for Waterford University Hospital could be accommodated within a single cath lab. Funding has been provided to support extension of the existing cath lab operating hours to 12 weekly sessions per week, or by 20%, as recommended in the Herity Report. </p>  <p>  As I advised the Deputy in my response to his most recent Parliamentary Question on 29 May last, approval and funding has been provided for the posts required to facilitate this service expansion and recruitment is currently being progressed by local management and the HSE&rsquo;s National Recruitment Service. A mobile cath lab has been deployed since October 2017, initially for a period of 20 weeks but since extended to allow time for University Hospital Waterford to complete recruitment of the additional staff required for the service extension to the existing cath lab.</p>  <p>  The Herity report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services should cease to allow the hospital focus on the much larger volume of planned work.  I asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac catheterisation laboratories and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review, which is expected to be complete by June 2019. </p>  <p>  When I met with South East Oireachtas members on 14 February last, I indicated that I would give some consideration to the various issues raised by the group, including the potential for the deployment of a modular cath lab, as an interim solution, pending the outcome of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. My Department is currently examining this matter at my request and it is envisaged that this examination will be completed shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-28a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062800045#WRA02200"><p>Improving waiting times for hospital procedures and outpatient appointments is a key commitment in the Programme for Government.  In Budget 2018 the NTPF budget was increased to &euro;50 million. The priority for this funding is reducing waiting time for hospital procedures, and the Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan 2018, published in April, targets a reduction in the number of patients waiting for a hospital procedure to under 70,000 by the end of this year. A key target under this plan is patients waiting for Ophthalmology services, specifically Cataract procedures, and the NTPF will fund over 5,000 procedures this year.</p>  <p>  However, the issue of growing outpatient waiting list numbers is one that impacts on patients across a wide number of health specialties, including ophthalmology.  The NTPF has allocated &euro;3 million of its 2018 funding for Outpatient initiatives and my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are in the process of finalising an Outpatient Action Plan for 2018. All Hospital groups have been invited by the HSE and the NTPF to develop and bring forward proposals for outpatient initiatives for inclusion in the Action Plan. </p>  <p>  This plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with its National Service Plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services, improve the accuracy of the waiting list, and trial a number of NTPF-funded interventions, including weekend and out-of-hours clinics.</p>  <p>  Cork University Hospital advice that the development of Ophthalmology services in Cork is being progressed and that this may include the recruitment of medical ophthalmologists whose work would focus on outpatient clinics.  I have asked Cork University Hospital to provide greater details on their plans to reduce outpatient waiting times for this service and I will forward them to the Deputy as soon as I received them.  </p></reply>

To support this, we plan to establish a new statutory scheme for home care services.  The potential for changes to the funding system for home support will be considered as part of the process of developing the new scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am happy to say that we reached an important milestone in this process earlier this week when I published the report of the findings of the public consultation on home care.  The consultation process took place last year and approximately 2,600 submissions were received. The report includes a number of interesting points made by respondents in relation to innovative funding models and is available from the Department&rsquo;s website.  The findings will now be used help to inform the design of the new home care scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to progressing the development of the new scheme as quickly as possible.  However, this is a complex undertaking and will require a significant amount of detailed preparatory work.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Department and the HSE are continuing to improve existing services, including in 2018 the introduction of a single funding stream for home support services. Also in 2018, an additional 754,000 hours will be delivered, bringing the total to over 17m hours, along with 235 Intensive Home Care Packages.  </p></reply>

Since 2012, around &euro;200m additional funding has been provided for this care programme, including approval of some 2,000 new posts. The HSE continues to enhance various aspects of its CAMHS service, including improved access at local level for areas such as Laois and Offaly.</p>  <p>  There has been increased funding for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services for Laois/Offaly from &euro;1.387m in 2011 to &euro;2.528m in 2018.  Overall staffing levels for the service increased from  approximately 16 in 2011 to 34  in 2018.  It should be noted too that there has been a significant increase in activity levels for the respective years with, for example the number of referrals received increasing from 167 to 1044; new appointments offered increased from 146 to 797; and new clients seen increased from 107 to 484.</p></reply>

The goal of this reform is to develop a world class person-centred hospital service that values and empowers staff to deliver safe, high quality, integrated services based on health care needs and driven by efficiency and best clinical evidence, research, practice, education and innovation leading to better patient outcomes.</p>  <p>  The implementation of Hospital Groups is continuing, with a more co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of services across all the hospitals within the group. This allows for a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care while ensuring that patients who require true emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals. </p>  <p>  The HSE has established a Hospital Group CEO Forum that enables and supports information sharing across Hospital Groups. The membership includes all Hospital Group CEOs and the Forum is now well established with meetings held monthly. The Hospital Group CEOs also meet regularly with the HSE National Director for Acute Operations.</p>  <p>  Further, the HSE Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division (CSPD) was established to rethink the delivery of health and social care in order to improve and standardise patient care across all healthcare settings, irrespective of location. The CSPD works to bring together clinical disciplines, enabling them to share innovative, evidence-based solutions in the interest of providing improved person-centred care. As part of this, the National Clinical Programmes have been established to improve and standardise patient care by bringing together clinical disciplines and enabling them to share innovative solutions to deliver greater benefits to every user of our services. The programmes involve close collaboration between the HSE and the Colleges, working in partnership with patients, nursing and therapy leads, and with the Department of Health. Each of the Clinical Programmes has a Clinical Lead, a multi-disciplinary Working Group (including patient representatives), and a Clinical Advisory Group. Having a wide range of clinicians involved means that the proposed solutions are more robust in their conception, and supports effective implementation. </p>  <p>  The Clinical Programmes are tasked with improving specific areas of the health service. This is achieved by designing and specifying standardised models of care, guidelines, pathways and associated strategies for the delivery of integrated clinical care. The programmes provide clinical leadership to support local implementation teams where needed.  Examples include National Clinical Programmes for Acute Medicine, Acute Surgery, COPD, Diabetes, Emergency Medicine, Critical Care, Chronic Heart Disease, Stroke and many more. </p>  <p>  A further platform to share good practice is through the Health Service Excellence Awards. Held annually, these enable the HSE to identify new and creative service developments that can be shared and implemented, as appropriate, in different parts of the health system. </p></reply>

A temporary arrangement was made by the HSE with a private provider pending the completion of a tender process.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has now completed the formal tendering process for the provision of an established air ambulance service to transfer Priority 1 paediatric transplant patients to the UK between 7pm and 7.30am. The contract was awarded to Air Alliance Express and will be in place for a 2-year period.  It is envisaged that most of the patients who will use this service will be children who need to go the UK to undergo major organ transplant. The Air Alliance Express service has been operational since 23 April 2018.  </p></reply>

Last week, I met with national and local HSE representatives who assured me that they are exploring every possible option to ensure that the vacancies in the CAMHS services in the South East are filled and to ensure continuity of service. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the global lack of availability of mental health specialists, the HSE is currently conducting an extensive advertising campaign to fill these vacancies. In terms of immediate cover, they have established weekend Consultant Paediatric Psychiatry clinics in Waterford by availing of support from Galway-based Consultants. In addition, the HSE has been in contact with other CHO areas and with agencies both abroad and in the private sector to look for locum cover. </p>  <p>  I wish to strongly re-state the Government&rsquo;s commitment to mental health. This is reflected by the allocation of an additional &euro;200 million for mental health services since 2012 resulting in around &euro;910 million being available to the HSE for mental health this year. While this amount is significant by any standard I will continue to press for further resources annually in line with Programme for Partnership Government commitments. </p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan 2018 commits to further development of CAMHS. This is against a background where the demand for CAMHS has increased by 26% between 2012 and 2017. Around 18,800 referrals are expected for HSE CAMHS this year alone.</p>  <p>  To meet this demand, we have increased the supply of services. We have approved over 2,000 new posts in Mental Health since 2012. We now have 69 CAMHS teams and three Paediatric Liaison Teams supported by around 75 CAMHS beds nationally. Further beds are planned to come on-stream as quickly as possible. In addition, we have funded an extra 140 Psychiatric Nurse Undergraduate places each year.</p>  <p>  The recent appointment by the HSE of around 114 Assistant Psychologists and 20 Psychologists will help to develop counselling services in Primary Care. I understand that 13 Assistant Psychologists posts have been introduced in CHO 5, which includes Waterford &amp;amp; Wexford. It is anticipated that these posts will deal with the less complex child and adolescent cases thereby reducing the demand on CAMHS. </p>  <p>  I will be meeting the HSE again on 3 July next where they will provide me with a progress report on addressing the issue raised by the Deputy. </p></reply>

This is an increase of 3.5% on the numbers waiting in May 2017 (5,618).</p>  <p>  The Ireland East Hospital Group advises that Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives to deliver additional outpatient clinics and to address some of the long waiters on the outpatient waiting list. </p>  <p>  In Orthopaedics, the hospital has added an Arthroplasty Clinical Nurse Specialist since February 2018 to assist with outpatient clinics. The appointment of a new Musculoskeletal Physiotherapist is planned for early autumn which should free up additional capacity for new patients. </p>  <p>  Cardiology services will be improved with the upcoming appointment of a new Cardiologist between Our Lady&rsquo;s in Navan and the Mater Hospital. This is one of a number of additional posts approved between both hospitals as part of the Navan redesign programme. </p>  <p>  The regional rheumatology service will be supported with the appointment of two new Advanced Nurse Practitioners &ndash; these nurses will manage existing patients in nurse-led clinics thus freeing up space to accommodate new referrals. </p>  <p>  New organisational structures are to be introduced in the hospital. A recruitment campaign is currently underway to appoint a Scheduled Care Lead who will oversee scheduling of patients in a timely manner, and support the validation of outpatient lists and measures to improve the rates of "Did Not Attend"  (DNA) patients at outpatient clinics.</p></reply>

In addition UL Hospitals Group continues to focus on seeing and treating those who have been waiting the longest. </p>  <p>  The Hospital Group further advises that neurology outpatient activity at UL has been steadily increasing year-on-year since 2016, and saw a 7% increase from 2017 to 2018 (Jan to April). UL advises that the increase is growth in demand and an increase in the number of urgent referrals are the main reasons for these increases. </p>  <p>  The Hospital Group also advises that it continues to explore further waiting list initiatives, including long-waiter clinics and outsourcing, to make further improvements to waiting lists across the Hospital Group.   </p>  <p>  In order to address the issue of growing outpatient waiting list numbers, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are in the process of finalising an Outpatient Action Plan for 2018. This plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with its National Service Plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services, improve the accuracy of the waiting list, and trial a number of NTPF funded interventions, including weekend and out of hours clinics. I look forward to publishing the plan in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

As part of this process the NTPF and the HSE are currently reviewing proposals from hospitals for waiting list initiatives.  The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate.  </p><p>The NTPF initiatives will include a number of high volume specialties and in particular 5,000 cataracts, 800 hip/knee replacements, 1,200 tonsillectomies.  In addition, under the Plan, the NTPF commits to offer treatment to all clinically-suitable patients waiting more than 9 months for treatment in these high volume specialties. </p><p>Finally, my Department has placed a particular priority on performance improvement in scheduled and unscheduled care in order to improve access for patients. At the end of 2017, a new Unit was established in my Department with a remit to work with colleagues, with the HSE and NTPF to provide strategic direction and drive a whole of Department approach to performance oversight and innovation in this area.

While the Inpatient and Day Case (IPDC) Action Plan was published in April to address waiting times for IPDC procedures, the Outpatient waiting list remains a significant challenge to be addressed in 2018. </p>  <p>  There are currently 650 patients on the neurology outpatient waiting list in Sligo, representing a decrease of 7% on figures for July 2017. </p>  <p>  In order to address the issue of growing outpatient waiting list numbers, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are in the process of finalising an Outpatient Action Plan for 2018. This plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with their National Service Plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services, improve the accuracy of the waiting list, and trial a number of NTPF funded interventions, including weekend and out of hours clinics.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that in 2017 almost half a million (477,000) outpatients did not attend their appointment. Therefore, the validation of waiting lists is an important part of the Outpatient Action Plan and of the successful management of waiting lists and clinics. This month I approved the establishment of a Central Validation Office in the National Treatment Purchase Fund in order to centralise the validation of all waiting lists across the HSE. The NTPF envisages being in a position to commence validation of patient files from September of this year.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific measure being taken by Sligo University Hospital, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly. </p></reply>

In this regard, my Department is currently finalising an implementation plan in response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, with a focus on the initial three year period.  It is my intention to bring proposals to Government before the summer recess and to publish the implementation plan shortly thereafter. While I accept that this is later than originally envisaged, it is important that we get it right. </p>  <p>  I have already acted on several of the specific recommendations proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. A Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office is being established in the Department of Health and a provision of &euro;1 million was made available for the Office in Budget 2018. This office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by Government, arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. The process for the appointment of an Executive Director to lead the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office has been managed independently by the Public Appointments Service. This has been a thorough process involving a national and international executive search. An appointment will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  An independent board for the HSE is being established as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. The General Scheme of a Bill has been published and it is hoped that legislation will be enacted this year.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Report recommended the removal of private practice from public hospitals. I have established an Independent Review Group to examine how private practice can be removed from public hospitals. It will report later this year.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the geographical alignment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations has recently been completed and responses are being analysed. This will inform work on broader health service structural reform as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has demonstrated significant commitment to invest in our health and social care services since the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report. Funding for new initiatives in Budget 2018 were closely aligned with proposals in Sl&aacute;intecare. In addition, funding of &euro;10.9 billion has been earmarked for health projects in the National Development Plan. This will include the development of primary care centres, community diagnostics, community care beds and additional acute hospital capacity, including three elective facilities. </p>  <p>  This is the first time in the history of the State that cross-party consensus of this scale has been achieved on health policy and I welcome this. I intend to harness the consensus generated by the Report to move forward with a significant programme of health reform. The Government is committed to making tangible improvements in our health service and the Sl&aacute;intecare Report provides the direction of travel for this.</p></reply>

Of these, 54% were waiting for less than 6 months, and 81% were waiting for less than 12 months.  The outpatient waiting list data for May indicates there were 3,629 people waiting for gynaecology services, compared with 4,610 in May 2017, a decrease of 21%. Of these, 44% were waiting for less than 6 months, 74% were waiting less than 12 months. </p>  <p>  In recent years, CUMH, has received funding to invest in the improvement in its Gynaecology Services. The South/South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) committed an additional &euro;700,000 to the service for 2017 to provide increased theatre capacity and staffing resources to deliver improved waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments.  While an additional &euro;0.4m in funding has also been allocated by SSWHG for CUMH gynaecology services in 2018. </p>  <p>  In January 2017, a National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme was established within the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services. </p>  <p>  In addition, the SSWHG has developed a phased approach to improve waiting times for gynaecology services at CUMH. This includes the establishment of the SSWHG Women and Children Services Directorate last year, which, I expect, will ensure better coordination and utilisation of maternity gynaecological resources across the group.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan 2018 which was published in April outlines the combined impact of HSE and NTPF activity in 2018 to reduce the number of patients waiting for treatment.

While the Inpatient and Day Case (IPDC) Action Plan was published in April to address waiting times for IPDC procedures, the outpatient waiting list remains a significant challenge to be addressed in 2018. </p>  <p>  There are currently 2,664 patients on the neurology outpatient waiting list in Galway University Hospital, with 70% (1,891) waiting less than a year. </p>  <p>  In order to address the issue of growing outpatient waiting list numbers, my Department, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are in the process of finalising an Outpatient Action Plan for 2018.

Therefore, the validation of waiting lists is an important part of the successful management of waiting lists and clinics. This month I approved the establishment of a Central Validation Office in the NTPF in order to centralise the validation of all waiting lists across the HSE. The NTPF envisages being in a position to commence validation of patient files from September of this year.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific measure being taken by Galway University Hospital, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly. </p></reply>

Last week, I met with national and local HSE representatives who assured me that they are exploring every possible option to ensure that the vacancies in the CAMHS services in the South East are filled and to ensure continuity of service. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the global lack of availability of mental health specialists, the HSE is currently conducting an extensive advertising campaign to fill these vacancies. In terms of immediate cover, they have established weekend Consultant Paediatric Psychiatry clinics in Waterford by availing of support from Galway-based Consultants. In addition, the HSE has been in contact with other CHO areas and with agencies both abroad and in the private sector to look for locum cover. </p>  <p>  I wish to strongly re-state the Government&rsquo;s commitment to mental health. This is reflected by the allocation of an additional &euro;200 million for mental health services since 2012 resulting in around &euro;910 million being available to the HSE for mental health this year. While this amount is significant by any standard I will continue to press for further resources annually in line with Programme for Partnership Government commitments. </p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan 2018 commits to further development of CAMHS. This is against a background where the demand for CAMHS has increased by 26% between 2012 and 2017. Around 18,800 referrals are expected for HSE CAMHS this year alone.</p>  <p>  To meet this demand, we have increased the supply of services. We have approved over 2,000 new posts in Mental Health since 2012. We now have 69 CAMHS teams and three Paediatric Liaison Teams supported by around 75 CAMHS beds nationally. Further beds are planned to come on-stream as quickly as possible. In addition, we have funded an extra 140 Psychiatric Nurse Undergraduate places each year.</p>  <p>  The recent appointment by the HSE of around 114 Assistant Psychologists and 20 Psychologists will help to develop counselling services in Primary Care. I understand that 13 Assistant Psychologists posts have been introduced in CHO 5, which includes Waterford &amp;amp; Wexford. It is anticipated that these posts will deal with the less complex child and adolescent cases thereby reducing the demand on CAMHS. </p>  <p>  I will be meeting the HSE again on 03 July next where they will provide me with a progress report on addressing the issue raised by the Deputy</p></reply>

A prescription-only medicine should be taken only when it has been prescribed for an individual by their medical practitioner, or other appropriate health professional, who has taken the person&rsquo;s medical history into account. </p>  <p>  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 the mail order supply of prescription-only medicines is prohibited. Supply of prescription-only medicines by way of information society services (which includes internet sales) is also not permitted. The supply of unauthorised prescription-only medicines in any manner in or into Ireland is prohibited. </p>  <p>  There are significant concerns associated with the purchase of prescription-only medicines over the internet. There is no guarantee as to the safety, quality or efficacy of the unauthorised products purchased online. Medicines purchased in this manner are often found to be counterfeit or have inaccurate labelling or product information.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority is the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland. The HPRA, in co-operation with Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, employs enforcement actions to identify the unauthorised supply of prescription-only medicines, including those containing misoprostol and mifepristone, to the public. The HPRA uses a range of enforcement powers to tackle this activity, including seizing the products.</p>  <p>  Following the outcome of referendum on 25 May, a provisional result was published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 29 May. However, three applications for permission to challenge the result of the referendum have been made to the High Court under section 42 of the Referendum Act 1994. On 26th June the High Court began to hear the applications. It is possible that the hearings may run over a number of days, after which a decision will be made by the Court.</p>  <p>  The Constitution is not yet amended, and until the legislation to regulate termination of pregnancy is enacted, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 remains the law on termination of pregnancy. The 2013 Act allows for termination of pregnancy only where there is a risk to the life of the pregnant woman. The use of any medicinal products for the termination of pregnancy must be in line with the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the legislation to regulate termination of pregnancy and the services necessary to support its implementation.</p></reply>

Mental Health remains a key care programme priority for this Government. This is reflected by a Budget 2018 allocation of an additional &euro;35 million for new developments, bringing the total HSE mental health budget to over &euro;910 million.</p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan 2018 commits to further development of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). This is a Strategic Priority Action in the Plan, against a background where the population of children is expected is increasing, and where the demand for CAMHS has seen a 26% increase between 2012 and 2017. Around 18,800 referrals are expected for HSE CAMHS this year, with about 14,300 being seen by this specialist service.</p>  <p>  CAMHS has been prioritised in new funding made available by Government over recent years. Additional resources and facilities means there are now 69 CAMHS teams, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams, supported by around 75 CAMHS beds nationally, with further beds planned to come on-stream in the near future. </p>  <p>  There has been widely acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist CAMHS staff, particularly Consultant Psychiatrists. </p>  <p>  The HSE is working to provide the best possible service within available staffing resources.  A key focus is on managing clinical risks and prioritising referrals accordingly.  Mental health services, including CAMHS, will continue to deliver on a number of service improvements to increase productivity and efficiencies. A key approach to developing services for young people, and thereby reducing pressures on CAMHS, is the decision by Government to increase access to counselling services in Primary Care, with the appointment of 114 Assistant Psychologists and 20 Psychologists. These key staff are now being put in place nationally by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Other CAMHS specific measures included in the HSE Service Plan 2018 includes:</p>  <p>  - An initiative to increase the number of CAMHS referrals to be seen this year by 27%, compared to 2017;</p>  <p>  - Provide for a seven day per week service for CAMHS to ensure supports for young people, in line with Connecting for Life;</p>  <p>  - Improve Day Hospital services within CAMHS; and</p>  <p>  - Develop Eating Disorder specialist community teams for young people.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also focussing on enhanced access by older adolescents to specialist mental health services, along with continued appropriate placement and care in CAMHS specific settings.</p>  <p>  My Department has set as a priority with the HSE, the development of a 24 hour helpline and digital support services.  These services will provide for easier access to supports and where appropriate early and urgent interventions using innovative digital technologies.</p>  <p>  The Minister is introducing a telepsychiatry pilot project to ascertain the merits of delivering care from a distance using technology and videoconferencing. Telepsychiatry can provide a range of services including psychiatric evaluations, individual, group and family therapy, education and patient management.  There is substantial evidence regarding the effectiveness of telpsychiatry and research indicates a high level of patient satisfaction, especially among adolescents and those with autism and severe anxiety disorders.</p>  <p>  There are many types of mental health services available in Ireland and it can be difficult to understand what service is most suitable to address an individual&rsquo;s needs. Minister Daly has prioritised the establishment of a 24/7 signposting telephone mental health line service as a single point of contact to assist people locate and be referred to appropriate mental health services in their area.</p>  <p>  Minister Daly is working closely with the HSE to develop a crisis digital texting service for those who feel that they are in need of urgent support. People will be able to text a specific number monitored by a trained counsellor responding from a secure online platform. A trained volunteer can then be assigned to the caller to assist the individual immediately. Following the call or texting conversation, appropriate referrals and follow-up work begins.</p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to address the important issues raised in the Ombudsman's report, including prioritising cases based on professional assessment. My Department will continue to closely monitor the issues raised, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive.</p></reply>

To support this, we plan to establish a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care services. The Department is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review 2018, published in January, outlines projections of demand and capacity requirements for a range of health services to 2031. As our population, particularly our older population continues to grow, key projections from the analysis indicate, for the period 2016-2021 </p>  <p>  - 12% growth in overall population;</p>  <p>  - 59% growth in 65+ population; and</p>  <p>  - 95% growth in 85+ population.</p>  <p>  The review notes that if key reforms and productivity measures are implemented, a 120% increase in home supports will be required by 2031.</p>  <p>  While the new home care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and HSE are continuing to incrementally improve the existing services and meet the growing demand for home support services. The HSE has begun streamlining services in 2018 by bringing together the funding for home help and standard home care packages, which now operate as a single home support service. This new approach will provide significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;112 million has been provided for home support services over the past three years. Home support services were a particular area of focus in Budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25 million allocated. As a result, 2018 has seen a further increase in the provision of home support services. The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of just over 17 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people. This represents an increase of 754,000 hours and home support for 500 more people over last year.  In addition, 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  Earlier this year, due to the adverse winter weather, a further initiative saw an additional 324 people being provided with home support services.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government committed to increasing funding for Home Care Packages and Home Help every year. The planning and management of future health expenditure will be considered as part of the annual estimates and budgetary process which seeks to balance available funding across all the various service areas to achieve the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritise areas of greatest need.</p></reply>

This additional funding is being used to expand the availability of drug and alcohol treatment services and to improve health services for drug-users who are homeless.  </p>  <p>  Drug and alcohol task forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem and in initiating appropriate responses, so that there is a coordinated approach involving all sectors to the problem of substance misuse in local communities. The 24 task forces currently receive approximately &euro;28 million in funding per annum from the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;250,000 was provided in Budget 2018 to improve the organisational effectiveness of the task forces in implementing the national drugs strategy. Task forces were recently invited to apply for up to &euro;10,000 in additional funding, on a once-off basis, under this scheme. Their applications are currently being processed by my Department.</p>  <p>  I strongly believe that resources should be directed towards interventions that are most effective in reducing problem substance use. Measuring the effectiveness of responses to the drug problem is therefore an important objective of public policy. Towards this end, the Department of Health will develop a performance measurement system by 2020 which will improve accountability across all sectors, including the task forces.   </p></reply>

Of these, 54% were waiting for less than 6 months, and 81% were waiting for less than 12 months.  The outpatient waiting list data for May indicates there were 3,629 people waiting for gynaecology services, compared with 4,610 in May 2017, a decrease of 21%. Of these, 44% were waiting for less than 6 months, 74% were waiting less than 12 months. </p>  <p>  In recent years, CUMH has received funding to invest in the improvement in its Gynaecology Services. The South/South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) committed an additional &euro;700,000 to the service for 2017 to provide increased theatre capacity and staffing resources to deliver improved waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments.  An additional &euro;0.4m in funding has also been allocated by SSWHG for CUMH gynaecology services in 2018. </p>  <p>  In January 2017, a National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme was established within the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services. </p>  <p>  In addition, the SSWHG has developed a phased approach to improve waiting times for gynaecology services at CUMH.  This includes the establishment of the SSWHG Women and Children Services Directorate last year, which, I expect, will ensure better coordination and utilisation of maternity gynaecological resources across the group.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan 2018 which was published in April outlines the combined impact of HSE and NTPF activity in 2018 to reduce the number of patients waiting for treatment. Under the Plan, the HSE will deliver 1.14 million hospital procedures across a range of specialties. The NTPF will deliver 22,000 Inpatient Day Case treatments across a range of specialties through both outsourcing and HSE insourcing. As outlined in the Plan, the NTPF and the HSE will invite proposals from hospitals for waiting list initiatives. The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate. </p></reply>

I have asked the HSE to implement the move to HPV testing as the primary screening method as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  While the extent to which the HPV testing can be done in Ireland is being assessed, it is likely that a tendering process will be needed to meet at least some of the HPV testing requirement.

Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.  This approach is also enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a withdrawal agreement is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. </p><p>It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors and examining legislative actions which may be needed at EU level.</p><p>However, the Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector.  Capital expenditure of &euro;116bn over the coming decade under Project Ireland 2040 will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead. There was also increased funding provided to my Department in Budget 2018 for the opening of six new diplomatic missions. A further seven new Missions will be opened as part of the next phase of expanding Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint. These thirteen new Missions will be located in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Oceania and will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets.</p><p>Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. In total 34 reports analyzing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments. All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i></i></p><p>Longer-term economic strategies will also be critically important in addressing the challenges of Brexit, including Ireland 2040 &ndash;the National Development Plan. The Enterprise Strategy 2025 Renewed was recently launched and we are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank on a potential increase in investment in the country. </p></reply>

Concrete commitments with a view to achieving this objective were agreed and set out in the Joint Report on Progress in December 2017 and have since been transposed into legal terms in the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement.  The EU has been clear that this is an essential element of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement and that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners are actively engaged in examining the range of scenarios that may apply post-Brexit and have ongoing communications with my Department on this and on other issues.</p></reply>

In Germany, local public banks are called Sparkassen. These Sparkassen are only permitted to operate in specific geographic areas. The aim and philosophy of the Sparkassen is the promotion of economic development and financial inclusion in the particular regional area in which they operate, rather than solely maximising profits. Working closely and building relationships with local SMEs is an important element of the German local public banking model and the work of the Sparkassen. </p>  <p>  Officials in both departments have been working closely together to conduct a thorough consideration of the potential for a local public banking model in Ireland, based on the German Sparkassen model. This has included a detailed analysis of a proposal put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group. The proposal outlines how a local public banking model, based on the German Sparkassen model I have described above, could work in Ireland. This process included a number of meetings between officials from both my own Department and Minister Ring&rsquo;s Department, and representatives from Irish Rural Link and SBFIC. </p>  <p>  The report on local public banking has now been completed. Minister Ring and I circulated the report to all Government departments for comments and observations before jointly submitting it to Government at a Cabinet meeting in May. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the report has now been approved by Government and I anticipate that it will be ready for publication in the near future. </p>  <p>  Additionally, there are already significant Government measures in place to support access to finance by Irish SMEs.  These include the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices, the Credit Review Office and the Credit and Counter Guarantee Schemes.  </p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is working with other Government departments to develop tailored and innovative schemes to meet the evolving needs of Irish SMEs, such as the Agricultural Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme I announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018 respectively.</p></reply>

This report, and the substantial amount of data and analysis underpinning it provide a valuable evidence base for consideration of this matter. The report shows that there has been strong recruitment since 2011 to the estimated 237 recruitment grades across the public service, with over 60,500 new entrants hired. This includes over 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 Special Needs Assistants. Full year costs based on a two point increment jump for those effected were estimated at approximately &euro;200m.</p>  <p>  Discussions on this issue with public service trade unions and representative associations, commenced in October 2017, with a formal plenary meeting taking place on 27th of April last. Further discussions are ongoing as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue.</p>  <p>  I understand the issue regarding primary school principals raised in the question relates to one of the recommendations by the Public Service Benchmarking Body (II) in December 2007 based on a particular point in time public service pay review. The recommendation related to an increase in the allowance payable to principals of primary schools. Provision for payment of the recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body (II) was made under the Towards 2016 &ndash; Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009. However, payment of the increases provided for under that Agreement were not paid as part of the then Government&rsquo;s programme of measures to restore stability to the Public Finances and reduce the then existing deficit between income and expenditure. </p>  <p>  The non-payment of general round increases under the terms of the Towards 2016 Agreement and certain other third party recommendations were not and have not been paid and were acknowledged under the Haddington Road Agreement as part of the substantial contribution made by public servants to the fiscal consolidation process at that time. Accordingly, I have no plans to implement the recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body (II) made in 2007.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p>  <p>  All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  The CWMF is mandated by circular and was developed to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.  It provides an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review.</p>  <p>  Public works contracts are awarded following a competitive process where tendering contractors, respond to an invitation to tender issued in accordance with EU or National rules.  Projects up to &euro;50,000 may be awarded following a direct invitation to at least 5 contractors, between &euro;50,000 and &euro;5.548m a contract notice must be published on eTenders, the national tendering portal.  All projects with a value in excess of &euro;5.548m must also be published on the Official Journal of the EU.  In the case of the latter two, contracts are usually awarded using the open or restricted procedure.</p>  <p>  In the case of the open procedure, the tenders of all contractors who meet the minimum pre-stated selection criteria will be considered for evaluation and award in accordance with the stated award criterion.  In the restricted procedure, contractors respond to a request to participate notice, they are normally shortlisted by reference to selection criteria and only those who are shortlisted are invited to tender.</p>  <p>  In all cases tenderers are provided with identical sets of tender documents which provide significant detail on the project.  Tenderers, when arriving at their tendered price, must take into account the requirements of the project, the constraints within which it is to be built and the attendant risks allocated under the conditions of contract.</p>  <p>  The management of the tendering process for a public works contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.  Under the EU procurement directives contracting authorities are obliged to seek an explanation from tenderers where the price bid appears to be abnormally low in relation to the works defined in the tender documents.  Having undertaken an examination of the make-up of the price, a contracting authority may only reject a tender where it is satisfied that the evidence supplied does not account for the low price taking into account:</p>  <p>  - The economics of the construction method;</p>  <p>  - The technical solutions chosen or the exceptionally favourable conditions available to the tenderer from suppliers;</p>  <p>  - The originality of the works proposed by the tenderer;</p>  <p>  Where the evidence suggests that the tenderer&rsquo;s price is low because of non-compliance with labour or environmental law, or where the tenderer is in receipt of State aid then it must be rejected.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that recent studies undertaken in the United Kingdom, following the collapse of Carillion, have highlighted the meagre margins that main contractors earn on building projects.  Given the commonality in approach between the UK and Irish construction industries there is every reason to believe it is prevalent in the Irish construction sector.  This culture must be addressed within the industry if it is to service its client base in a professional manner.</p>  <p>  There are consequences both to the contractor who tenders a price that is unsustainable and to the contracting authority who accepts that price.  From the contracting authority&rsquo;s point of view, poor quality materials and workmanship can often arise in these circumstances, claims and disputes may also arise and in cases where the contractor becomes insolvent it can lead to extensive delays to the project&rsquo;s delivery.  Where the contractor is concerned they may be operating without a profit (if not incurring a loss), may have very poor relationships with suppliers and, in the worst cases, may become insolvent as a result of a failure to properly account for real cost of the works.</p>  <p>  There is a balance to be struck in deciding to award a public contract between value for money and a quality project outcome.  From the taxpayers perspective it can be very difficult to justify a decision to reject the lowest price out of hand, particularly in the circumstances where the contractor who has bid the price is willing to undertake the project.</p>  <p>  The impact of awarding contracts at low prices was highlighted in the Report on the Review of the Performance of the Public Works Contracts published in 2014.  A range of measures was recommended in that report to discourage unsustainably low pricing, amongst other aspects.  One of these measures, which has been implemented since 2016, requires contracting authorities to prepare a bill of quantities to a defined set of rules which accurately measures all the necessary works on larger projects.  Tenderers are required to price all of the measured items providing a very detailed breakdown of the price bid meaning that low pricing can be identified.</p>  <p>  A further measure identified in the Report is the development of a medium term strategy for the procurement of public works projects.  Engagement with industry stakeholder bodies has recently commenced on that strategy which will outline the optimum means of procuring the necessary expertise to deliver Ireland 2040 in a sustainable, efficient and cost effective manner.</p></reply>

Statistics in relation to the current school year will be published later this year when the data has been compiled.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 marks the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish education and training service the best in Europe within a decade. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provides for an additional 1280 teaching posts in the 2018/19 school year. This includes a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level. These changes will come into effect in September for the 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  It is expected that this one point improvement in the staffing schedule, when implemented in September 2018, will further improve the overall ratio of teacher to students. The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.7:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2016/17 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.7 in the same period.</p></reply>

SCP focuses on targeting and providing supports to young people identified to be most at risk of early school leaving.  Access to the SCP has not yet been extended to those 79 schools which were included in the DEIS programme last year.  As noted in DEIS Plan 2017, supports under DEIS will be extended on a phased basis to those schools not already in receipt of these supports.   SCP comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla Educational Welfare Service are fully committed to the future of the School Completion Programme and will continue to work with colleagues in my Department to ensure that it will deliver the best possible outcomes for young people at risk of early school-leaving. </p></reply>

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers. </p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently laid before the Oireachtas a report on the matter of the pay of new entrants to the public service. The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussion on remaining salary scale issues with the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of newly qualified pay. That process commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting. Further talks began on the 27th of April with all public service unions in relation to new entrant pay. Further engagement is being arranged as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue.</p></reply>

It is the case that many teachers who would have been available to carry out substitution work are now gaining permanent and long term contracts.</p>  <p>  I am aware of reports that some schools are experiencing difficulties in finding substitute teachers.  In order to ease the situation, in the last school year I suspended the limits that teachers on career break can work as substitutes. Schools were also reminded that, in considering career break applications, the needs of pupils should take precedence and they must take account of the availability of appropriate qualified replacement teachers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I recently established the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. The Group is considering the issues that impact on teacher supply, including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession. The Steering Group will oversee a programme of actions according to strict timelines and clear deliverables.  In undertaking its task, the Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  At this point the Steering Group and, the working groups reporting to it, have met on a number of occasions. The Group will meet again on 29 June and I hope to be in a position to announce further measures in this area over coming months.</p>  <p>  A value for money review of the Supply Teacher Scheme was published in July 2006. Following that review, it was considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences rather than retaining the supply panel as then constituted. </p></reply>

Further engagement is being arranged as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue.</p>  <p>  In the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body (issued in December 2007), the Body evaluated the pay and jobs of 109 grades across the public service, including school Principals. The Body recommended pay increases for 15 grades, including changes to the allowance payable to Principals of primary schools and of small post-primary schools. </p>  <p>  Under the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, it was agreed that the increases recommended in the second report of the PSBB would be paid as follows: </p>  <p>  (a) 5% from 1 September 2008, or where the total increase is less than 5%, the full increase from that date; </p>  <p>  (b) The issue of the payment of any balances will be discussed between the parties in the context of any successor to this Transitional Agreement which might be agreed between the Social Partners, or whatever other arrangements may be in place on the expiry of this Transitional Agreement.</p>  <p>  The pay terms contained in the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 were not implemented due to the State&rsquo;s worsening financial circumstances. In line with current Government policy, there are no plans to implement the recommendations set out in the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body as they apply to any public servant.</p></reply>

My Department advised the school that due to the Department&rsquo;s need to prioritise funding for the provision of essential mainstream classroom accommodation to meet demographic need, that it was not possible to consider the school's application at that time. </p>  <p>  The school authority was also advised that it is my Department&rsquo;s intention to replace temporary accommodation, including purchased accommodation, with permanent buildings, over the lifetime of my Department&rsquo;s 6 Year Capital Programme. </p>  <p>  To enable this development, my Department will be carrying out an assessment of the number of prefabs being used in schools to deliver the curriculum. This will also determine whether or not individual prefabs need to be replaced in the context of the long-term accommodation needs of each individual school. When completed this assessment will quantify the number of prefabs to be replaced.  It is intended that this assessment, when finalised, will enable the replacement of such prefabs to commence in 2019.  A funding provision of &euro;180 million is being made available from 2019 for this initiative in the programme.</p></reply>

SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices in these areas. Despite this the number of female apprentices in the craft apprenticeships remains low.</p><p>Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system in Ireland into a range of new sectors of the economy, following two calls for new apprenticeship proposals from employers and education and training providers.  To date eleven apprenticeship programmes are operational and we are now seeing a strong increase in female participation in many of these new programmes, particularly in the financial and hospitality sectors.  With further new apprenticeships to get underway this year, many of which that are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace, it is expected, as these new apprenticeships are rolled out, that this will lead to a continued increase in female participation.  While this is welcome, it is also important to address issues influencing the low level of recruitment of women in the craft sectors.</p><p>As set out in our Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, my Department, in conjunction with SOLAS, is currently reviewing the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation. The review is due to be completed shortly.</p><p>Furthermore, a digital campaign to promote apprenticeship is now underway with a dedicated Twitter feed #Generation Apprenticeship, a new apprenticeship website <i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>, an Apprenticeship Ireland Facebook page and a LinkedIn page. In all aspects of the digital campaign women feature prominently and there will be a specific focus on encouraging women and girls to consider apprenticeship as a means of launching or developing their careers.</p></reply>

Special classes are for students who have a recommendation for a special class placement in their professional reports.</p><p>Should the NCSE identify the requirement for additional special class placements in the area it will contact schools in the area in relation to establishing an ASD special class. Schools may also apply to the NCSE to open a special class where a need has been identified in their area i.e. a number of students have professional reports indicating they require the support of a special class.  </p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>In addition, the NCSE will consider:</p><p>- the school&rsquo;s accommodation and accessibility</p><p>- the number of special classes, if any, already in the school. </p><p>With regard to Co. Kildare in particular, there are 4 special schools and 70 special classes attached to mainstream schools. Of these, 6 are ASD early intervention classes, 42 are primary ASD classes and 14 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Kildare have increased from 32 in 2011/2012 to 62 in 2017/2018.</p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish approx. 5 new ASD Special Classes in Co. Kildare for 2018/19 school year to meet currently identified need.</p><p>In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit (SNU) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. A two classroom Special Needs Unit is being provided in each of the two post-primary schools currently under construction in the area referred to by the Deputy. Both of these schools are due to be completed by May 2019.</p><p>Parents/Guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement, including special class placement, should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child. Contact details are available at . </p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities</p></reply>

Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  The process is underway for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of personnel under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Limerick Division was 564, of whom 308 and 136 Garda&iacute; were assigned to the Henry Street and Roxboro Road Districts respectively. There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 54 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.    </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just over 1,960 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 63 members have been assigned to the Limerick Division, 10 of whom were allocated to the Henry Street and Roxboro Road Districts from the latest attestation on the 15 June 2018. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the Limerick Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. </p></reply>

This is a long-standing principle of our system of justice. The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).  Any information in relation to possible criminal acts should be provided directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation. The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP, who is completely independent in carrying out her functions.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the Courts, subject only to the Constitution and the law, are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the conduct of any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge. It is not open to me to comment or intervene in any way in relation to how particular proceedings are conducted or, indeed, on the outcome of such proceedings.</p>  <p>  If someone is not satisfied with the manner in which their complaints have been handled by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, then it is open to them to contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Office (GSOC).  GSOC, as you are no doubt aware, is the independent body charged with receiving complaints from the public concerning members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is not open to me to intervene in this case in the manner the person in question is seeking. It is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, specifically the Garda Commissioner and his management team, who are responsible for investigating all forms of alleged criminality in the State in the first instance and not the Minister for Justice and Equality. Accordingly, I cannot accede to this particular meeting request.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, it is, of course, open to the person in question to seek independent legal advice in relation to their concerns, if they so wish.</p></reply>

Specifically, this involves considering the feasibility of establishing a specialised and dedicated insurance fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, funded by industry.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) has engaged with Insurance Ireland, submitting a mechanism for further cooperation and a costed proposal to Insurance Ireland in the latter half of 2017. Insurance Ireland has agreed to explore the proposal further, subject to a full cost benefit analysis, to be carried out by Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officers Working Group. The intention would be that such a dedicated Garda unit would be funded by Insurance Ireland members and non-members alike, i.e. all entities writing non-life insurance business in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Further progress on this recommendation is dependent upon the outcome of this cost benefit analysis, which is currently awaited. As I have previously informed the House, Insurance Ireland has indicated that it expects to be in a position to provide an update in this regard by the end of June 2018.</p>  <p>  Any proposed agreed mechanism will, of course, ultimately be subject to the approval of the Garda Commissioner and myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

Broad programmes of education are provided which generally follow an adult education approach. The Department of Education and Skills funds an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the ETBs. A Joint IPS/ETBI Education Strategy 2016-2018 was launched in June 2016.  </p><p>The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning.</p><p>The attached table shows the recorded education participation rates for each Prison Education Centre from January to May of 2018.  These show that there had been decreases in the participation rates in some establishments in January to April this year, but participation levels have increased again in May.  The primary reasons for the decreases in March and April are the Easter break which occurred at the end of March and into the first week of April; the suspension of some classes due to the unavailability of discipline staff and increasing numbers of protection prisoners in custody.  There were also some closures of Prison Education Centres due to Storm Emma at the end of February.</p><p>In Mountjoy male prison, the drop in numbers participating in education is linked directly to the increasing number of prisoners on protection and the fact that by April all prisoners on both A and B wing were on protection. In response to this significant development, the timetable was overhauled in order to provide the same educational opportunities to those on protection as was being provided to other prisoners. This means that education is provided to non-protection prisoners only in the morning and to protection prisoners only in the afternoon. While this change makes education available to all, it has resulted in a notable reduction in overall participation levels, as many protection prisoners are unwilling to mix freely with each other. </p><p>The Progression Unit (Mountjoy West) allows increasing numbers of prisoners to attend external training programmes on a day release basis.  These are not counted in the participation rates for Mountjoy Prison Education Centre.  There is also high participation in work and training activities, which is not included in the education participation statistics. </p><p>In the Progression Unit Education Centre, modules have been developed to better prepare people for the World of Work: QQI Health and Safety Awareness, Work Experience, Customer Services Occupational First Aid, Career Preparation, Self-Employment Skills, Money Management, Soft Skills, Cooking on a budget and Manual Handling. </p><p>Participation levels in education in Wheatfield Prison Education centre have been heavily impacted by full and partial closures from January to April this year due to officer shortages and as a result of nationally mandated closures due to adverse weather conditions.  Wheatfield Prison Education Centre offers a comprehensive and dynamic curriculum, QQI, State Examination, Creative Arts and Holistic programmes and aims for a high level of student participation.  In spite of restrictions due to unavailability of discipline staff, many students completed state exams, QQI and music examinations this year.  In 2018, Wheatfield Prison Education Centre recruited new teachers to expand the curriculum.  In order to boost participation levels, extra-curricular activities are offered one afternoon each month, a Wellness and Mental Health Weeks was hosted and frequent Musical events are also hosted for the student body. Interviews of prospective students take place on an ongoing basis and students are recruited directly from prison landings and workshops and student mentoring also takes place on some landings. A separate school is provided for the segregated landings in Wheatfield i.e. North-Three School. </p><p>The current successful recruitment campaign for new prison officers will enable the Irish Prison Service to increase its staff complement and will greatly reduce the number of occasions on which classes have to be suspended due to the unavailability of discipline staff.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has also put Regime Management Plans in place to manage staff detail when there is a shortfall in the number of staff on duty.  This is designed to minimise the impact on prisoners engaged in structured activity including education.</p><p>The Prison Education Service works as part of the multi-disciplinary team in each prison to promote education participation, provide a relevant curriculum for students and to prepare them for the transition back to the community.<table><tr><th>Education Unit</th><th>Jan-18</th><th>Feb-18</th><th>Mar-18</th><th>Apr-18</th><th>May-18</th></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>70.9%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>52.6%</td><td>46.8%</td><td>65.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>45.5%</td><td>33.1%</td><td>33.6%</td><td>33.8%</td><td>32.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td>22.9%</td><td>19.0%</td><td>17.2%</td><td>17.1%</td><td>26.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>46.0%</td><td>38.6%</td><td>34.7%</td><td>32.9%</td><td>49.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Dochas</td><td>54.0%</td><td>39.5%</td><td>36.9%</td><td>46.2%</td><td>63.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>43.7%</td><td>36.5%</td><td>33.9%</td><td>33.9%</td><td>44.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan</td><td>81.7%</td><td>59.7%</td><td>61.2%</td><td>58.5%</td><td>80.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>37.8%</td><td>27.4%</td><td>25.0%</td><td>26.5%</td><td>36.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy</td><td>19.8%</td><td>19.5%</td><td>16.7%</td><td>18.0%</td><td>27.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>50.2%</td><td>44.2%</td><td>42.1%</td><td>35.9%</td><td>50.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>55.7%</td><td>42.3%</td><td>42.6%</td><td>45.7%</td><td>56.6%</td></tr><tr><td>MJ West</td><td>58.1%</td><td>42.5%</td><td>47.0%</td><td>49.5%</td><td>56.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>23.8%</td><td>19.4%</td><td>15.2%</td><td>19.6%</td><td>27.4%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

My Department and its agencies are working hard to ensure that all potentially impacted firms are taking the necessary steps to mitigate the risks and take advantage of potential opportunities resulting from Brexit.</p><p>My Department is engaged in helping SMEs prepare to withstand all Brexit scenarios, including a no-deal situation.  Encouraging companies to take action to identify their individual areas of exposure and to take positive steps to address them will build strong resilient businesses that can prosper in the face of difficult economic circumstances. </p><p>I am confident that the agencies under my remit have the supports available to enable companies to both consolidate market share within the UK, and become more resilient by broadening their exports to other international markets.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI), has launched several initiatives in response to Brexit, including:</p><p><b>- Brexit Scorecard:</b>This interactive online platform can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars. Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit.</p><p><b>- Be Prepared Grant:</b>This grant offers SMEs a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit. The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan.</p><p><b>- Brexit Advisory Clinics:</b>Enterprise Ireland held four Brexit Advisory Clinics over the past few months in Portlaoise, Mayo, Cavan, Cork and last week in Dublin&rsquo;s Aviva Stadium. Thepurpose of these Clinics is to support companies affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure. More Clinics are due to take place throughout the year.</p><p><b>- Brexit 'Act On' Programme:</b>This funding is to support the engagement of a consultant to draw up a report with tailored recommendations to help clients</p><p>address weaknesses and become more resilient.</p><p><b>- Strategic Consultancy Grant:</b>This grant helps client companies to hire a strategic consultant for a set period to assist the company to develop and implement significant strategic initiatives. </p><p>In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focused on further developing in-market expertise and networks, and placing greater focus on identifying new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns. In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020. </p><p>The 31 LEOs nationwide are assisting clients with a suite of supports which includes information, training and mentoring on Brexit related issues as well as advice on other sources of support.</p><p>InterTrade Ireland (ITI), has also been very active in assisting businesses address the challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce. A series of information and awareness raising events have been underway in towns across both North and South over recent months. ITI is also rolling out a &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues. </p><p>Other initiatives that my Department is advancing include the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms. I recently launched the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is aimed at supporting the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  Twenty-one successful applicants representing all regions of the country have secured up to &euro;30.5m for their projects in the first competitive call.</p><p>The work of my Department is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future, therefore I feel that all our efforts will put Ireland in a strong position in the event of a hard Brexit/no-deal scenario.</p></reply>

The Government approved the recommendations of the inter-Departmental Working Group (IDG) chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality (DJE),established to examine the implications of the judgement and decided to opt into the EU (recast) Reception Directive to give effect to the Supreme Court Judgement.</p>  <p>  An Implementation Group was established to oversee the opt-in process and involved formal discussions with the European Commission to ensure compliance with each aspect of the Directive. My Department's officials participated proactively and constructively on the IDG and on the Implementation group in relation to labour market access.  </p>  <p>Arrangements agreed under the opt-in process, which falls under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, were announced on the 27th   June 2018.  International Protection Applicants may apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality for a labour market permission, which covers both employment and self-employment, if they haven't received their first instance decision within 9 months. The Labour Market Access Unit (LMAU) of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), on behalf of the Minister, will process applications. The permission will be granted to eligible applicants for six months and will be renewable until there is a final decision on their protection application.</p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements for International Protection Applicants will not have access to the employment permit system operated by my Department. </p>  <p>  The interim arrangements for the short period from 9th February 2018 when Section 16(3)(b) was struck down until the introduction of the new process, enabled those seeking international protection to access the labour market through the Employment Permit Acts on the same basis as other non-EEA citizens. The Employment Permits Section of my Department inform me that only two applications for employment permits had been received from International Protection applicants.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality advise that on 9th February 2018 it established a self-employment scheme for those who have sought International Protection in Ireland that are waiting more than nine months for a first instance decision on their application.  As of Friday 22nd June 2018, the Department of Justice and Equality had received 754 applications for self-employment and 525 of those applications had been granted.</p>  <p>  Ireland operates a managed employment permits system which maximises the benefits of economic migration while minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market. It operates an occupational list system for in-demand occupations and those for whom a ready source of labour is available which are ineligible for an employment permit.

I am pleased to advise that I have since signed the regulations, which will come into force on 2 July 2018. </p>  <p>  The regulation of these professions will not require the establishment of a regulatory body. The professions will be regulated by the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board under the governance of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council (CORU), which was established as Ireland&rsquo;s multi-profession health regulator under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. The designating regulations will bring the number of professions regulated by CORU to sixteen. CORU was allocated &euro;3,135,000 in State funding for 2018 in respect of the ongoing implementation of the 2005 Act and the regulation of all professions designated under the Act. It is envisaged that the Council will become self-financing in due course as the registers for all sixteen designated professions are established on a phased basis. The annual registration fee is &euro;100.  </p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service will undertake an advertisement campaign later this month inviting suitably qualified and experienced persons to apply for lay and professional positions on the thirteen person registration board. I will then make the appointments and CORU will arrange for the board to hold its first meeting later this year. There is no remuneration payable in respect of these board appointments. Travel and subsistence is payable in accordance with approved civil service rates.</p></reply>

Its establishment followed the completion of the work of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility found that it is not feasible, desirable, or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility. However, in an interim report to the HSE in 2015, the CAG recommended that all children under the age of 18 years with a diagnosis of cancer should be awarded a medical card for a period of five years. The HSE gave effect to this recommendation on 1 July 2015. </p>  <p>  The Group was also tasked with developing guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions, so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them.  To that end the National Medical Card Unit (NMCU) in collaboration with the CAG has finalised the development of a Burden of Illness Questionnaire (BIQ). </p>  <p>  The BIQ is now being utilized in selective circumstances where the assessing doctor in the NMCU requires more complete information to allow a comprehensive assessment of the person&rsquo;s medical and social circumstances and any resulting undue financial hardship.</p></reply>

This is despite the additional demands on our Acute Hospitals, which, since 2000 are carrying out four times more procedures for patients ages 65 and over and twice as many in the under 65 age group. The overall IPDC waiting list is currently the lowest it has been since October 2016 when it was 79,621. </p>  <p>  The recently Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan launched in April, outlines the combined impact of HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) activity in 2018. The Action Plan has been developed to ensure an appropriate balance between high volume activities and offering treatment to complex long waiting patients. NTPF authorisations are made in respect of the longest waiting patients first.</p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan the HSE will deliver 1.14 million elective inpatient and day case discharges and the NTPF will deliver 22,000 Inpatient Day Case treatments through both outsourcing and HSE insourcing. </p>  <p>  The NTPF initiatives will include a number of high volume specialities and in particular 5,000 cataracts, 800 hip/knee replacements, 1,200 tonsillectomies.  In addition, under the Plan, the NTPF commits to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 9 months for treatment in these high volume specialities. </p>  <p>  Under the Plan, the NTPF and the HSE are also currently reviewing proposals from hospitals for waiting list initiatives.  The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate.  </p></reply>

It&rsquo;s report, Slaintecare, makes clear that a system-wide programme of reform, that has the full buy-in and support of all stakeholders in the health service, will be necessary to address these challenges.</p>  <p>  The successful delivery of the ambitious reform plans envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report will be a significant undertaking and needs to be translated into a detailed and phased programme of work to be delivered over a ten year timeframe. In this regard, my Department is currently finalising an implementation plan in response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, with a focus on the initial three year period.  </p>  <p>  This implementation plan will give direction to all stakeholders in the system, including the acute hospital sector, on the actions that will need to be taken in the coming years. </p>  <p>  I am also committed to investing in our acute hospital sector. The National Development Plan provides for &euro;10.9bn to be invested in health infrastructure in the coming decade. This allocation includes a commitment to increase acute bed capacity by 2,600 and to build 3 new elective hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway. I believe that this investment will be essential in meeting future demand needs of our population and can also act as a catalyst for change.</p>  <p>  The process that led to the development of the Slaintecare report has laid the foundation for consensus building and constructive engagement across all stakeholders. I intend to continue in this spirit and I look forward to working with stakeholders as we embark on this programme of reform. </p></reply>

The recently launched Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan outlines the combined impact of HSE and NTPF activity in 2018 to reduce the number of patients waiting for treatment to below 70,000 in 2018. This plan marks a very important milestone in delivering on this commitment.</p><p>In 2018 the NTPF will provide 22,000 inpatient day case procedures though both insourcing and outsourcing, while the HSE will deliver 1.14 million hospital operations or procedures This will mean that by the end of 2018 we will expect to see a significant reduction in the number waiting for a procedure to under 70,000 - from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017.</p><p>The Action Plan places a particular focus on hip and knee replacements, with &euro;9.8 million allocated by the NTPF for such procedures. The plan commits to offering procedures to all patients waiting more than 9 months for a hip and/or knee replacement in 2018, if clinically suitable  for treatment in an outsourced facility. The NTPF will also offer treatment for a range of other orthopaedic treatments in 2018. </p><p>While the improvements set out in the plan are significant, they are just the start, and I am committed to building on this progress with further initiatives to reduce waiting time for patients, including for those patients waiting for an outpatient appointment, within our Health System.</p><p>In

I have already secured agreement from the Minister for Public Expenditure that the budget will increase by a further &euro;55 Million in 2019.</p><p>This funding increase has helped to increase staffing levels, introduce new posts, improve our seven-days-a-week response and liaison services and to develop new clinical programmes. </p><p>In April 10,008 staff were employed in mental health services. Staffing levels in mental health services  show an increase of approximately 193 when compared to the April 2017  figure. In excess of 2,000 new posts have been approved since 2012 up to the end of 2017, of which some 1,352 have been recruited or are in the recruitment process. </p><p>While the level of vacancies and difficulty in recruiting skilled staff continues to pose a significant challenge to service provision, particularly in CAMHS, the provision of 136 new Primary Care Psychologists (including 22 basic grade psychology posts and 114 Assistant Psychologists) aims to reduce pressure on specialist CAMHS. Another measure in this area has seen the increase of Psychiatric Nurse Undergraduates places by 130 per year by 2021/22.</p><p>In relation to improved 7/7 (seven-days-a-week) response and liaison services, the HSE is now in the final stages of recruiting the staff required to deliver 7/7 Mental Health service cover for the areas that do not currently have a service in place. </p><p>Work continues to progress on mental health Clinical Programmes such as the Eating Disorder Care Programme, Perinatal Mental Health, ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Me<b>n</b>tal Illness and Substance Misuse.</p><p>While funding mental health services, which is not exclusive to my department, is an important component of achieving a reduction in suicides and improved services, simply adding more money to the budget will not improve mental health services on its own. I would welcome proposals outlining recommendations and proposed actions from any organisation, which can in turn be evaluated on outcomes and available funding.</p></reply>

However, our membership of the single market offers an opportunity for international cooperation with other member countries to try and reduce the cost of new drugs. The challenge of securing affordable access to innovate medicines is not unique to Ireland and we have been engaging with other EU countries in an effort to identify solutions.</p>  <p>  Ireland joined the BeNeLuxA Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy on 22 June 2018. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.</p>  <p>  In addition to BeNeLuxA, Ireland is participating in a number of other voluntary EU forums, including the Roundtable meetings with EU Health Ministers and the Pharmaceutical Industry, High Level Pharmaceutical Policy Meetings and the Valletta Technical Committee.  These platforms are currently exploring possible areas for cooperation including information sharing, horizon scanning and possible price negotiations and joint procurement. Such platforms could also lead to faster access for patients for some treatments. </p></reply>

In these instances, the HSE utilises a range of measures, including agency, locum and other-short term arrangements to support service delivery. Following on from its first report, in which it identified recruitment and retention problems in specialist groups in the health sector that are internationally in demand, the Pay Commission is currently giving consideration to a number of groups including nurses and consultants.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review which I published in January highlighted the scale of reform needed to meet the healthcare demands of our growing and ageing population. Under the National Development Plan capital funding for our health services, &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years, will be 165% higher than it was for the last 10 years. This provides a real, long-term opportunity to improve our health services, drive down waiting lists, increase bed capacity, reform pathways of care and modernise how we deliver health services guided by the principles in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p>  <p>  Even with the required reforms, the Review concludes that acute hospital bed capacity will need to increase by 2,600 to support timely delivery of care. This will require additional staffing at all levels and real changes to healthcare delivery in order to have a sustainable healthcare system, with an emphasis on public health and illness prevention. </p>  <p>  In the short term, reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities. In Budget 2018, &euro;50 million was provided to the NTPF to provide treatment for public patients this year, which more than doubled its 2017 total allocation for the NTPF. </p>  <p>  The most recently published National Treatment Purchase Fund figures for the end of May confirm that just under 78,600 patients are waiting for a hospital inpatient or day case procedure.  This represents a fall of more than 7,500 patients, or almost 9% in just 10 months. This positive progress in reducing waiting times for patients waiting for a hospital procedure is the result of the focus and investment by Government in this area utilising available capacity within and outside of the public health service.  In Budget 2018, &euro;50 million was provided to the NTPF to provide treatment for public patients this year, which more than doubled its 2017 total allocation for the NTPF.</p></reply>

It is a significant challenge given a backdrop of global shortages in health professionals and international competition for medical staff trained in Ireland. Where vacancies arise, the HSE utilises a range of measures, including agency, locum and other-short term arrangements to support service delivery.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made in growing the nursing and medical workforce in recent years as the economy has improved and more resources have become available. </p>  <p>  Increasing nursing and midwifery numbers has been a key priority for the past 18 months. The 2017 funded workforce plan, as part of the Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement, committed the HSE to recruiting 1,224 additional nurses and midwives. The final report setting out progress on implementation of the Agreement shows that there has been a significant growth in the appointment of nurses and midwives with 942 WTE of the 1,224 posts filled (WTE&rsquo;s). The HSE remain committed to the Agreement and efforts are underway to develop the 2018 nursing workforce plan. It has once again committed to offer all 2018 graduating student nurses and midwives permanent contracts within a Hospital Group or CHO, subject to their attaining registration and satisfactory performance. Nursing numbers have increased by 2,638 in the five years to end April 2018.</p>  <p>  With regard to consultants, numbers have increased by 101 in the 12 months to end April 2018 and by 456 in the five years to end April 2018. The number of Non Consultant Hospital Doctors has also increased, by 284 in the 12 months to end April 2018, and by 1,368 in the five years to end April 2018. The HSE has been focussed on addressing issues associated with the creation and approval of consultant posts and successful recruitment. It is now implementing the report 'Towards Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention', completed in December 2016. It is also focussed on implementing the recommendations of the 'MacCraith Group' to support the recruitment and retention of consultants and NCHDs</p>  <p>  Following on from its first report, in which it identified recruitment and retention problems in specialist groups in the health sector that are internationally in demand, the Pay Commission is currently giving consideration to a number of groups including nurses and consultants and is expected to report by the end of July. While there are many challenges I am satisfied that we will be able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of nursing, medical and consultant staff to meet demand.</p></reply>

The Traditional Hay Meadow action in GLAS promotes the maintenance of a traditional method of forage conservation that is beneficial to grassland flora and fauna. Farmers who have opted to participate in this action voluntarily commit to the closure of such meadows until July 1st and receive &euro;315 payment per hectare per year to compensate for income foregone. In total, these farmers will be paid at least &euro;18m this year for this one action. My priority is to ensure that farmers continue to qualify to receive payment for this action.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to bring forward the date permitted for cutting these meadows.</p></reply>

My Department has also been analysing the potential practical impact of a 'hard' Brexit on the day-to-day functioning of trade, as well as potential WTO tariffs that might be applied to Ireland's agri-food exports to the UK. In addition, Bord Bia's Brexit Barometer has helped  participating companies to assess their preparedness for Brexit and will be of assistance in the design of strategies to support such companies. </p>  <p>  This process is complex, involving many variables, and the detailed assessment is ongoing.</p></reply>

The facility to record this movement type is no longer required. Thus with effect from 1 June 2018, the option to apply for a Certificate of Compliance for movement of animals to another holding for feeding purposes was removed.  All applications received on or after that date for movement to a feedlot are treated as an application for the movement of an animal(s) to another holding.  </p>  <p>  As has been the position to date, S.I. No 77 of 2009, European Communities (Identification of Bovines) Regulation 2009 requires that a person shall not, except in accordance with a permit, transfer ownership or responsibility for a bovine to another person unless the passport relating to that bovine is completed and transferred to the person concerned with the animals.  In that regard the passport must accompany the bovine animals at all times during movement.     </p>  <p>  Keepers can continue to apply online for a Certificate of Compliance to move an animal to another holding using agfood.ie online services or an approved farm software package.  Alternatively, keepers can complete a form NBAS 31A (that is available on the Department&rsquo;s website or from a Regional Veterinary Office) and submit it to the Cattle Movement Notification Agency in Clonakilty as is currently the case.  </p>  <p>  The quality bonus payment scheme is a meat industry lead initiative and is not a Department scheme. For the purpose of the meat industry quality bonus payment scheme the count of farm residencies remains unchanged. That count is based on the number of residencies, including the herd of origin and each change in farm residency as a result of a farm to farm movement.  Movements to a holding for feeding purposes have historically been counted as a farm residency movement and therefore the removal of the feedlot movement facility on AIM will not impact on this.</p></reply>

This cost includes the following schemes: State Pension Contributory; Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension (where recipient is aged 66 and over); Deserted Wives Benefit (where recipient is aged 66 and over); Death Benefit Pension (where recipient is aged 66 and over); State Pension Non-Contributory and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (where recipient is aged 66 and over). </p>  <p>  Last December, an 85% Bonus was paid to some 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients, including pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and the long-term unemployed, at a cost of &euro;218.6 million. The cost of a 100% Bonus is estimated at circa &euro;257 million in 2018.  As was the case in previous years where a Bonus was subsequently paid (2014 to 2017 inclusive), there is no provision in the 2018 Revised Estimates for the payment (at any rate) of a Christmas Bonus in 2018.  Any decision taken regarding the payment of a Bonus in 2018 will have to be consistent with the legal requirements set out in the domestic Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013 and the targets set for Ireland by the EU Stability and Growth Pact. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that these costings include proportionate increases for qualified adults and for those on reduced rates of payment, where relevant.  </p>  <p>  The full year cost of increasing the Living Alone Allowance by &euro;3 per week is estimated to be &euro;32.8 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  The full year cost of increasing the Over 80 Allowance by &euro;2 per week is estimated to be &euro;17.4 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  The costs shown above are on a full year basis and are based on the estimated number of recipients in 2019.  It should be noted that these costings are subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2019.</p></reply>

On the 23rd January the Government agreed an interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA) solution for those affected by the 2012 rate-band changes. Under this approach, a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 (i.e. who is among those affected by the new ratebands introduced from that date) and who has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Those with lesser records may qualify for a pro-rata amount.</p>  <p>  Up to 20 years of HomeCaring credits, and / or 10 years of other qualifying credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years. </p>  <p>  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory). This interim TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that taking this approach &ndash; TCA with up to 20 years of homecaring credits for periods both before and after 1994 &ndash; is more advantageous to women who cared in the home, and who were the most affected by the 2012 changes, than a simple reversion to the status quo before 2012, which would have created new inequitable outcomes.  A simple reversal along those lines would, in many cases, have resulted in a smaller increase for such women, but a bigger increase for people who did not have such caring duties and who, in many cases, would have significant income from foreign pensions, in addition to their Irish pension.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to draft legislation to enable implementation of these arrangements. In line with the legislation, IT solutions must be developed to implement the changes. Accordingly, in the final quarter of this year, the Department will begin inviting impacted recipients of the State Pension (contributory) to seek a review of their pension calculations, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019, backdated to the 30th March 2018.</p>  <p>  This interim TCA solution is distinct from the one which will apply for all new pensioners from 2020, and which is currently subject to a public consultation.  The final design of that TCA model will be proposed to Government before the end of this year.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2019, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 30,000, and the number would be expected to increase in future years.  Accordingly, if there were 30,000 such grants made in 2019, at a rate of &euro;850 each, the cost would be approx. &euro;25.5 million.</p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Over 364,000 low income households benefit from this allowance, at an estimated cost of &euro;227 million in 2018.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  One allowance is paid per household representing a contribution towards the energy costs of a household; it is not intended to meet those costs in full.  </p>  <p>  The cost of an additional week of fuel allowance is estimated at approx. &euro;8.6 million.  Extending the duration of the scheme from 27 to 32 weeks would therefore cost an estimated &euro;42.9 million. Any decision to extend the duration that fuel is paid for would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  </p>  <p>  The fuel scheme is intended to provide some additional support for people on long-term welfare payments during the winter season which clearly does not last for 32 weeks.  By reducing the fuel season it restored the core purpose of the payment as a winter fuel support.  There was no cut in the rate of payment of the fuel allowance.  In 2016, with the improved economic conditions, the rate of fuel allowance was increased from &euro;20 per week to &euro;22.50.  The Government believed that increasing the rate during the colder weeks of the year, when the actual need was greatest, rather than extending a lower payment into months during which recipients faced a lesser heating cost, was the correct decision to make.  </p>  <p>  Fuel allowance is not the sole income support mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with special or additional heating needs.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package at an estimated cost of &euro;237 million in 2018.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs.  Exceptional needs payments (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  </p>  <p>  While I am aware that fuel poverty is a very real issue for low income households, income support is only part of the answer in terms of addressing fuel poverty.   The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of supports, investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock and energy efficiency awareness initiatives.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Self-employed contributors have been eligible for the invalidity pension from the 01 December 2017.  As the gentleman concerned has class S (self-employed) PRSI contributions paid, he fulfils the contribution criteria for IP from 01 December 2017. Following a review of all the information available the deciding officer is satisfied that the medical conditions for the scheme are satisfied and the gentleman has been awarded IP with effect from the 07 December 2017.  Payment will issue to his nominated bank account on the 05 July 2018. Any arrears due from the 07 December 2017 to 04 July 2018 (less any overlapping social welfare payment) will issue in due course.  The gentleman in question was notified of this decision on the 27 June 2018.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the open labour market. T&uacute;s places are reserved for those who are in danger of becoming distant from the labour market.  A person cannot go directly from CE to T&uacute;s.  Eligibility for the T&uacute;s scheme is confined to those on the Live Register for 12 months and currently in receipt of a jobseekers allowance payment.

Time spent on CE does not count towards T&uacute;s eligibility.
