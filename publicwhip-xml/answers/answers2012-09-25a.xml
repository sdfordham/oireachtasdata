Most of our inshore fisheries are operated by local people who are an integral part of our rural and coastal communities.  This type of fishing is an important source of income for many who live around the Irish coastline as it not only provides direct employment but also supplies very important produce to a range of outlets, from retail and restaurants to seafood processing units.</p><p>  I am not aware of having received a request for a meeting from Iascairi Intire na hEireann but I know that members of this group have previously met with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, who are responsible for development of the seafishing sector.  BIM staff work closely with all players in the sector to promote the development of the fishing and seafood industries.  If the group wish to have further discussions to explore areas of interest or concern with BIM a further meeting can be arranged.   Officials from my Department would also be available to meet with a delegation from Iascairi Intire na hEireann if there are issues that require further discussion.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-25a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092500056#WRA01100"><p>Exemption from income tax on the net rental profits arising from the lease of farmland has been available since January 1996 in certain circumstances and with defined limits. The eligibility and reliefs associated with it have been adjusted in a number of budgets since. At present, farmers must be a minimum of 40 years of age or over to be eligible for the relief.  The following income exemption rates also apply.</p><p>-  &euro;12,000 for leases of 5 &ndash; 7 years,</p><p>-  &euro;15,000 for leases of 7 &ndash; 10 years, and</p><p>-  &euro;20,000 for leases of 10 years or more.</p><p>  The objective of this measure is to provide the leasee with more security of tenure and thereby promote the proper maintenance and development of the land. Most recent figures available from Revenue are for 2009 when there were 2,747 claimants of this relief. </p><p>  The Department recognises that conacre or short term rental arrangements are not a desirable basis upon which medium or long term farm business planning can be founded upon. Many commercial full time farmers require leased land to achieve the necessary scale and efficiency as purchased land is scarce and expensive. Long term leasing gives such farmers more security of tenure, allowing them to make better longer term investment and planning decisions. The continued availability of this measure is a key element of the Department&rsquo;s policy around addressing the land access and mobility issues faced by farmers and I would urge both farmers and landowners who are engaged in conacre rental arrangements to carefully consider the mutual benefits of switching to a longer term leasing agreement. </p><p>  The issue of possible tax incentives in Budget 2013 is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Finance. The taxation measures announced in Budget 2012 reflected the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the agri-food industry and in particular to the expansion planned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, and I will be engaging with the Minister for Finance again before the introduction of Budget 2013 in relation to possible taxation measures linked to policy priorities in my Department.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-25a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092500056#WRA01300"><p>I would like, first of all, to acknowledge the importance of the agri-environment schemes in environmental terms and also from the point of view of the contribution which they make to farm incomes. These schemes support farmers who choose to deliver environmental goods for the benefit of society as a whole. The fact that I made provision of &#8364;243m in the 2012 Vote for my Department for REPS and AEOS, despite a very difficult budgetary situation, demonstrates the strength of both my own and the Government&#8217;s commitment to environmentally-friendly farming practices. I believe that the schemes enhance the farmer&#8217;s role as custodian of our countryside while allowing productive farming to continue and are an essential part of our response to the significant environmental challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup>   century. </p><p><br />  REPS and AEOS are area based schemes which are co-funded by the EU under the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 and EU Regulations governing the Schemes must be strictly adhered to. These require that a full and comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, as well as field inspections, must be completed before payment issue. The Commission have made it clear, in the course of audits, that all checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met. This means that a farmer&#8217;s application must be fully in order, all outstanding documentation provided and queries resolved before payment can be released to him or her. Given these requirements, my officials take considerable care in validating payments while also ensuring that farmers receive their payments as soon as possible. </p><p><br />  In overall terms, the situation is that payments are more advanced at this stage than in previous years and I am satisfied that payments are issuing on schedule. I am confident, also, that the full Vote provision of &#8364;243m will be spent this year and that there will be no underspend. </p><p><br />  Insofar as REPS is concerned, practically all of the remaining 30,000 participants have received their 2011 payment and the last remaining query cases are being dealt with as queries are resolved. Arrangements to commence payments in respect of 2012 are ongoing and I expect that I will be in a position to commence payments earlier than last year and in higher numbers.  There are about<i></i>14,500 active participants in AEOS, 8,200 in AEOS I and 6,300 in AEOS 2. Practically all of the early backlogs associated with these payments are now resolved. Almost all AEOS I 2010 payments have issued, and nearly 7,000 cases are finalised for 2011. The main issue holding up Year 2 payments are queries associated with capital investment claims and receipts. The Department has contacted all of the farmers where queries have arisen and is dealing with the responses received. Nearly 4,000 AEOS II participants have received their 2011 payment and payments continue to issue as the validation process is finalised. I expect to commence AEOS payments in respect of later in the year and to make a substantial number of payments before year end.</p></reply>

The Commission  proposals  involve a basic policy regulation,  a proposal on the Common organisation of the market (CMO) and a proposal on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).  All the proposals are subject to negotiation and adoption through the co-decision process involving both the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament. The negotiations between the Council, the Parliament and the Commission on agreeing a new basic Regulation are expected to take place during the first half of 2013, during the Irish Presidency.</p><p><br />  At the June 2012 Fisheries Council the Danish Presidency secured a Council agreement on General Approach on the basic Regulation and on the Common organisation of the market (CMO). The EU Parliament is also working to deliver its position on each of these proposals at present.   I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on all these proposals during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.</p><p><br />  Ireland&#8217;s overarching goal for the new CFP is for a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver a sustainable and eco centred fisheries landscape for future generations. </p><p><br />  Key issue and developments arising from the General approach adopted in June include:</p><p>- The removal from the Commissions original proposal of the mandatory nature of the proposed system of <b>Transferrable Fishing Concessions(TFCs)</b> which I vehemently opposed since the outset and which had the potential to concentrate quotas in the hands of a few powerful European fishing companies. The Commission proposal provides for the  continuation of the <b>Hague Preferences</b> system under which Ireland gets an enhanced share of certain key stocks on which we are</p><p>traditionally dependant.  While I would prefer their permanent incorporation in Ireland&#8217;s percentage share, I have not received any support for this arrangement.</p><p>- A new compromise approach setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of <b>discards</b> on a phased basis was agreed at Council in June. Plans will be designed to bring the fish stocks above levels capable of producing <b>maximum sustainable yields (MSY) by 2015</b>, where possible and for all stocks by 2020.  Irelands position on <b>regionalisation</b> is to a large degree mirrored by the conclusions of the Common approach where Member States involved in a region would work together, in consultation with the EU Advisory Councils for the region and formulate general recommendations for fisheries conservation and management in the region.   </p><p><b>- Future Funding</b> - the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be structured around 4 pillars, a) Smart, Green Fisheries, b) Smart, Green Aquaculture, c) Sustainable and Inclusive Territorial Development and d) Integrated Maritime Policy. I am seeking the continuation of aid for seafood processing and aquaculture, as well as for fleet modernisation and restructuring.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-25a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092500056#WRA01900"><p>Since their publication, the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for reform of the CAP have undergone detailed examination at Council Working Groups, the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Council of Agriculture Ministers. At the June Agriculture Council, the Danish Presidency presented a Progress Report outlining the current status of the negotiations. The Cyprus Presidency has continued the negotiating process, with debates at the Agriculture Council as recently as yesterday (24 September) on rural development and market support issues. The proposals are also being discussed in the European Parliament. Earlier in the summer, draft reports from EP rapporteurs on each of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals were published, and about 8,000 amendments proposed by MEPs are currently being processed within the Parliament.  A  number of these elements will be the subject of substantial discussion and amendment over the coming months, and there will be ongoing contact at informal level between the Presidency, Commission and Council as they are developing their positions. </p><p>  Negotiations on the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020 are being progressed in parallel, primarily through the General Affairs Council, although the final decisions will be taken by the European Council. Many of the CAP issues, including the key issue of distribution of funds between Member States, are being discussed in the MFF negotiations and will ultimately be agreed as part of these negotiations.  </p><p>  My key concerns as regards the reform proposals arise in four areas.  These are the overall CAP funding, the method for distributing CAP funds between Member States, the method for distributing direct payment funds within Member States and the overarching need for simplification in the reformed CAP. </p><p>  On the budget, the funding proposals in the MFF maintain CAP spending at current levels in nominal terms post-2013. The agriculture heading is the one showing the greatest restraint, and in my view the amount proposed by the Commission is the minimum required. However, there are continuing, and intense, pressures for reductions in the proposed overall EU budget, with obvious implications for proposed CAP allocations. The Irish Government will continue to resist any pressure for reductions in the CAP budget. </p><p>  As to the allocation of CAP funds between Member States, the current Commission proposals for Direct Payments in Pillar 1 take a pragmatic approach to redistribution and are broadly satisfactory, albeit with some loss to Ireland (estimated at around 1.4%).  The Commission has yet to table a specific proposal for allocation of pillar 2 (rural development) funds.  I have concerns that the basis on which they propose to do so could reduce our allocation.  However I am vigorously defending our Pillar 2 funds, and will continue to do so.  </p><p>  As to the distribution of direct payments within Member States, the Commission proposal is to gradually move towards a system of uniform per hectare payments, or flat rates, by 2019, in each Member State or region of a Member State.  Many Member States already have such flat rates or are evolving towards them. I recognise that we cannot continue to base our payments on outdated historic production references. Nevertheless, I have major difficulties with the pace and extent of convergence in the Commission&rsquo;s proposal.  </p><p>  Under a national flat rate, although the overall allocation to Ireland would not change, around 76,000 Irish farmers would gain an average of 86% on their current payments, while around 57,000 would lose an average of 33%. These are average percentages, and some of the gains and losses would be far larger than this. For example, in the extreme case of those on very high payments of over &euro;1000 per hectare, the loss would be well over 70%.  In general, the losses would be incurred by more productive farmers. This would have undesirable consequences at a time when Ireland is trying to encourage sustainable intensification in the agri-food sector, as we strive to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. </p><p>  I have accordingly been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions. I also want a more gradual, back-loaded transition process. The &lsquo;approximation&rsquo; approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard. The Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; proposal for redistribution between Member States is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent. Modelling in my Department suggests that the application of this system to the distribution of funds between farmers in Ireland would lead to much smaller gains and losses to individual farmers than a flat rate system. However the precise level of transfers depends on the details of the methodology used.</p><p>  I have been very active in seeking allies for this position and I have been making significant progress, particularly with a group of Member States with somewhat similar concerns.  However, it should also be understood that a majority of Member States have no difficulty with the idea of flat rate payments, although they have concerns about other aspects of the proposals.</p><p>  The negotiation process on CAP is a complex and difficult one, but all of my efforts are focused on achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland. These efforts will be continued over the coming months as I continue to build close working relationships and potential alliances with the European Parliament and with Member States. I will also continue to press the Irish position with Commissioner Ciolos - whom I met as recently as last Friday in Dublin - ahead of a determined attempt to reach an agreement during our Presidency in 2013.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-25a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092500056#WRA02100"><p>Analysis of lobster stocks over recent years has shown that lobster stocks are over exploited in many areas around the coast.  The catch per pot haul has declined in those areas and while the stock does not appear to be in imminent danger, the reduction in catch rates has resulted in fishermen using more and more pots to maintain their earnings.  </p><p>   Present measures to protect the lobster stock include Council Regulation (EC) No. 850/98, which prescribes a minimum landing size of 85mm for lobster and the Lobster Conservation of Stocks Regulations 2006, which prohibit the catching, landing or sale of v-notched lobsters.  The lobster v-notching and live return scheme, operated by BIM and co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund, is a vital national tool in ensuring that many female lobsters caught are v-notched by BIM staff and returned alive to the sea to spawn and contribute to the reproduction of the stock over many years.</p><p>  My policy for all sea-fisheries is to promote sustainable fishing, good environmental practice and compliance with law.  In the case of inshore fisheries, in light of the judgement of the European Court of Justice against Ireland concerning non-compliance with the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, the overriding priority continues to be to bring all inshore fisheries and aquaculture in Natura 2000 sites into full compliance with the EU Birds &amp; Habitats Directives.  </p><p>  The Habitats Directive requires that an appropriate assessment consider the potential impact of the proposed activity on the conservation objectives for each Natura 2000 site affected.  Given the national nature of the lobster fishery, almost all of the approximately 90 Natura sites around our coast could be affected.  In addition, the Directive requires that the potential impacts on the habitat of a proposed activity be considered in combination with the potential impacts of all other activities or proposed activities in each Natura site, including other fisheries, aquaculture and non-fishing activities.  </p><p>  The resource intensive Natura 2000 compliance project will ultimately lead to appropriate assessment of all of our Natura sites.  That multi annual, multi-agency project is continuing to address appropriate assessment of each of our Natura sites in turn.  A substantial body of scientific data has been generated over the course of recent years and is now near completion.  The project is currently focussed on roll-out of appropriate assessments.  Three comprehensive appropriate assessments under the Habitats Directive are already completed, in respect of Castlemaine Harbour County Kerry, Dundalk Bay Co. Louth and Roaring Water Bay Co Cork.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-25a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092500056#WRA02400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 76 together. </p><p>  I received the submission from the United Farmers Association in relation to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and reform of the Single Farm Payment late last week.  I very much welcome the submission. The current reform of the CAP will set the context and policy framework for the future development of the agricultural sector in Ireland and I am anxious to hear from all stakeholders concerning their proposals for the direction of these reforms.   </p><p>  I am still examining the detailed points made in the submission but I would be happy to provide some preliminary comments at this stage.  </p><p>  I fully accept and can endorse many of the points made in the submission concerning the need for equity, fairness and balance in reform of the CAP.  I agree with the concept of full decoupling and the importance of taking into account social and environmental considerations in addition to economic criteria.  </p><p>  My priorities in the negotiations on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy arise in four key areas.  These are the overall level of CAP funding under the EU budget, the method adopted for the distribution of CAP funds between Member States, the method for distributing direct payment funds within Member States, and the overarching need for simplification in the reformed CAP. </p><p>  In that respect I do have some difficulty with some of the points made in the UFA submission, notably the suggestion to set payments at fixed rate per hectare.  I recognise that we cannot continue to base our payments on outdated historic production references. Nevertheless, I have major difficulties with the concept of flat rates of payment per hectare.  </p><p>   Under a national flat rate, although the overall allocation to Ireland would not change, around 76,000 Irish farmers would gain an average of 86% on their current payments, while around 57,000 would lose an average of 33%. These are average percentages, and some of the gains and losses would be far larger than this. For example, in the extreme case of those on very high payments of over &euro;1000 per hectare, the loss would be well over 70%.  In general, the losses would be incurred by more productive farmers. This would have undesirable consequences at a time when Ireland is trying to encourage sustainable intensification in the agri-food sector, as we strive to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. </p><p>  I have accordingly been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions. The &lsquo;approximation&rsquo; approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard. The Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; proposal for redistribution between Member States is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent. Modelling in my Department suggests that the application of this system to the distribution of funds between farmers in Ireland would lead to much smaller gains and losses to individual farmers than under a flat rate system. However, the precise level of transfers depends on the details of the methodology used.</p><p>  The negotiation process on CAP is a complex and difficult one, but all of my efforts are focused on achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland. These efforts will be continued over the coming months as I continue to build close working relationships and potential alliances with the European Parliament and with Member States. I will also continue to press the Irish position with Commissioner Ciolos - whom I met as recently as last Friday in Dublin - ahead of a determined attempt to reach an agreement during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2013.</p></reply>

Coordination of the State contribution to FH 2020 is being overseen by this Committee which includes representatives from Bord Bia, Teagasc, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Enterprise Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department. The HLIC also engages regularly with various private sector groups with a key role in FH2020. Implementation of many of the key measures needed to achieve the growth figures set out in the report is a matter for private sector actors including industry and individual farmers.</p><p><br />  As a high level strategic vision, the Food Harvest 2020 report does not contain implementation plans related to specific sites, including Natura 2000 sites. However, my Department and the HLIC are acutely aware of the need to ensure that appropriate assessment and strategic environmental analysis are considered, in line with the relevant EU Directives, and carried out where required, in the course of achieving the targets set out in the report. </p><p><br />  The HLIC committee recognised that the broad strategic targets in the report could be achieved in a variety of ways and determined that an independent environmental analysis should be commissioned of various possible scenarios through which the targets set out in the report could be achieved. The results of this analysis will inform the implementation of measures by all relevant actors, including those in the private sector. An independent team of experienced consultants with expertise in both agriculture and environmental assessment has been procured by my Department to carry out this work. The team has presented a detailed interim report to the HLIC and is due to present its final report by the end of October.</p><p><br />  The analysis is in line with the strategic environmental assessment process and includes the likely impacts of achieving the targets, through a number of scenarios, including; biodiversity, flora/fauna, water, including groundwater quality, soil, air quality, landscape and climatic factors including impacts on greenhouse gas emission levels. My Department is considering if the analysis should include an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive, and in this regard we are engaged in discussions with the European Commission. </p><p>As part of the analysis<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  process my Department has facilitated a public consultation, with details of the consultation posted on my Department&#8217;s website on 11 May 2012 and advertised in the Irish Independent on 16 May 2012 with a closing date of 28 June 2012 so that submissions could inform the work of the consultants in preparation of the interim report. Following representations from a number of interested parties, my Department extended the closing date to 6 July 2012, representing an eight week consultation period. Any further submissions received after the deadline, are also being forwarded to the consultants to inform their final report. </p></reply>

Specifically within the dairy sector, the stakeholders identified the abolition of the milk quota regime in 2015 as a real opportunity for the sector to expand.  Ireland strongly supported the abolition of the regime, on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy industry and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.</p><p>  The setting of the target that the volume of milk produced in 2020 will be 50% greater than that produced in the 2007-2009 baseline period, reflects the confidence of the industry, as represented by the stakeholders on the Food Harvest Committee, in the potential of the sector.  </p><p>  My Department and its agencies are playing their part through the monitoring, and implementation where relevant, of the 55 actions identified by the Dairy Expansion Activation Group&rsquo;s Roadmap as a means to achieving the 50% target; through the provision of support for a Dairy Efficiency Programme which provides for the  transfer of critical knowledge within the sector by way of Discussion Groups; through  the provision of dairy equipment grants for the upgrading of dairy farms; and through the activities of Teagasc who are playing a critical role in research, development and innovation in the sector and Bord Bia who are engaged in the  development of a sustainability model for the Irish dairy sector, as well as the provision of support for the work of ICBF in improving breed quality in the Irish herd. I am confident that  milk processors will also play their part, taking appropriate decisions on the basis of viable market assessments, to have in place the necessary processing facility to meet the increased supply.  Indeed I am aware that the country&rsquo;s two leading milk processors have recently announced their plans for providing the necessary increased processing capacity.</p><p>  While we are all aware that the supply management arrangements that currently exist under the Milk Quota regime will no longer apply after 2015, I am confident that the processing industry will work with the milk producers to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to allow a coherent and thriving dairy industry to exploit the undoubted potential in existing and new markets. </p></reply>

Given that GM crops are not cultivated commercially in Ireland and are unlikely to be for the foreseeable future, the issue of cultivation and coexistence does not arise at present.  </p><p>  Policy on genetic modification across Government Departments is that Ireland&rsquo;s general stance at EU level and in international fora should be positive but precautionary, recognising the potential benefits of genetic engineering, while maintaining a fundamental commitment to human safety and environmental sustainability based on scientific risk assessment and management.  </p><p>  The field study being carried out by Teagasc on genetically modified potatoes resistant to late blight is part of a publicly funded EU research project being carried out by a consortium of 22 partners representing 15 EU Member States.  The goal of the study is to research the impact of the GM potato on the blight disease itself and on soil organisms, which are essential to maintaining soil health.  </p><p>  The Aarhus Convention recognises the need for increased transparency and greater public participation in decision making. Teagasc are committed to disseminating all their research findings on these trials to the public, and have stated that during the study, the trial site will be accessible to the public for open days and information sessions and that they welcome the participation of all stakeholders.</p></reply>

In relation to the authorisation and use of products consisting of or containing authorised GM ingredients in animal feed, my Department adopts, on the basis of scientific evaluation, a positive but precautionary approach to EU applications for the authorisation of GM ingredients in food and feed and supports applications which have been deemed to be safe by EFSA.  </p><p>  In regard to the recent approval granted by the EPA to Teagasc, to carry out field trials on a genetically modified potato, with improved resistance to late potato blight, it must be pointed out that these trials do not constitute cultivation of a commercial crop and that under the EPA consent attached to this approval, they will be subject to strict conditions with regular monitoring and reporting to the EPA for compliance. </p></reply>

This was approved and will enable payment to issue immediately following 16 October and will represent early payment of &euro;600 million to farmers.  </p><p>Also I appreciate fully the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers and I remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements.  Payments worth some &euro;154 under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme will begin tomorrow, 26th   September. This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country.  REPS payments in respect of 2011 are up to date. A total of &euro;64 million has been paid out to-date and i envisage that by the end 2012 a further &euro;121 million will be spent. AEOS payments are well advanced and continue to issue as quickly as possible.  My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are paid on the earliest possible date.   </p><p>  Teagasc have been very active in providing advice &amp; assistance for farmers affected by the bad weather.  All Teagasc offices are taking calls from concerned farmers. A series of public meetings are being held across the country in September to address fodder / financial and social aspects of the weather crisis. Weather clinics were held in all Teagasc offices recently. </p><p>  I am very aware of the difficult situation with regard to winter fodder this year. A survey conducted by Teagasc identified a shortage on many farms, particularly dairy farms and also highlighted that addressing this would require different approaches on each farm. I am delighted that a number of workshops have been conducted by Teagasc where farmers could discuss with an advisor the best solution for their own circumstances.</p><p>  In addition, I approached Minister Hogan who is responsible for the Nitrates regulations and agreed extensions to the period allowed for spreading of both chemical and organic fertilisers this Autumn to 30 September and 31 October respectively. This is aimed at maximising the opportunity for a farmer to extend the grazing season this Autumn and reduce the winter feed requirement.</p><p>  My officials are in regular contact with the banking sector with a view to discussing the credit needs of the sector.  I am also pleased that a number of banks have recently announced new lending programmes for farmers that take account of the specific needs of the sector.  The banks have also attended a number of recent workshops and conferences and are engaging with academics with a view to improving financial training in the sector.  I am fully aware that credit is severely limited due to the current global economic situation and my officials will continue to engage with all relevant parties to ensure that adequate credit is made available for the sector.</p></reply>

This restructuring included:</p><p>  - dissolving and reorganising a number of administrative Oireachtas Committees to allow the re-allocation of resources towards Oireachtas Committees dealing with Government Departments;</p><p>  - the establishment of an Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, to focus solely on this Government priority area; The establishment of an Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to deal with the increased workload in this area in light of the proposed changes to the CAP; and </p><p>  - the merger of the role of Chairperson of the Oireachtas Committee on the Good Friday Agreement with that of the Irish Co-Chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.</p><p>  These reforms did not increase the number of Oireachtas Committee Chairpersons.</p><p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to increase the number of D&aacute;il sitting days by 50%. The number of sitting days has been significantly increased since the change of Government through the introduction of regular Friday sitting days and by reducing the length of D&aacute;il breaks at Christmas and Easter; after bank holidays; and during the summer. In the Government&rsquo;s first year in office there were 127 D&aacute;il sitting days, compared with 88 D&aacute;il sitting days in the last year in office of the previous Government.</p><p>  Work on a second set of D&aacute;il reforms is at an advanced stage. The Government Chief Whip has held discussions with the D&aacute;il Whips, the Ceann Comhairle, the D&aacute;il Reform sub-committee of the D&aacute;il CPP, the Chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairs and officials in Leinster House and the second phase of Government&rsquo;s D&aacute;il Reform Programme will be introduced later in the year. </p></reply>

It was established under the NESDO Act 2006 and is the body corporate for the National Economic and Social Council (NESC).  NESDO has already completed a substantial restructuring programme.  Up until 1 April 2010, it had two other constituent bodies, the National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance (NCPP) which were dissolved on that date.  </p><p>This led to substantial savings on both pay and non-pay expenditure, mainly as a result of reduced accommodation, rent, staffing levels and administrative costs.

This is a reduction of over &#8364;1.1m<b></b>  on 2010.</p><p><br />  My Department also rationalised the work and achieved substantial savings in relation to three other bodies which were formerly within its remit in recent years.  The total separate programme funding for the work of the Ireland Newfoundland Partnership and the Active Citizenship Office ceased in 2009 and their work subsumed into the Department.  The separate Offices in these areas have been discontinued which has given rise to savings in my Department&#8217;s Estimates of approximately &#8364;356,000 per annum.

In focusing on EU development policy during the Presidency, we will seek to build on the strong focus in Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme on the fight to end hunger and undernutrition and the growing impact of global challenges, including climate change. </p><p>  The Irish Presidency comes at a crucial period for international development policy, as the international community opens discussion on the framework for global development after 2015, the target date for the Millennium Development Goals.  A special political meeting will be held at the United Nations, probably in September 2013, to review progress on the Millennium Development Goals and to begin consideration of the post-2015 development framework. </p><p>  A key priority for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency will be to ensure that the EU adopts a strong, coherent position for this Millennium Development Goals event.  In working with our partners to guide discussions on the post-2015 development framework we will build on our commitment to eradicate poverty and hunger in the world.  We will also work to highlight the important linkages between hunger, nutrition and climate change and to have these linkages recognised for future policy and programming internationally.</p><p>  We will also work to forge stronger links between humanitarian relief and development aid, based on experience in emergencies in recent years.  Drawing on lessons from the Horn of Africa emergency in 2011 and with input from our partners in developing countries, we will explore the practical application of these principles and showcase examples of best practice. We will place particular emphasis on the EU&rsquo;s approach to disaster risk reduction, helping communities to prepare and take action to avert the effects of disasters and emergencies.  We plan to hold an informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Dublin in February 2013, which will be the first opportunity for substantive discussion by Ministers of all these key issues. </p><p>  I and my officials have been consulting closely with Ireland&rsquo;s development NGOs in preparation for the EU Presidency.  The policy document just published by Tr&oacute;caire is an important contribution to the discussion.  I look forward to continuing our dialogue with Tr&oacute;caire and the other members of D&oacute;chas, the umbrella body for the development NGOs, in the lead-up to and during the EU Presidency.</p></reply>

In addition to its normal ongoing functions, the Department currently has to manage an unprecedented conjuncture of major international responsibilities against a background of a 12% reduction in its core personnel complement over the past three years.  Ireland&rsquo;s current Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has impacted heavily on the workload of staff at headquarters and in many of our Missions abroad, overlaps with the necessary extensive advance preparations for Ireland&rsquo;s 2013 EU Presidency, which will also considerably increase the demands on the Department.  Meeting these challenges requires the maximum possible availability of skilled and experienced staff, particularly at middle management and senior levels.  While the Department has been granted some temporary additional posts for the OSCE chairmanship and for the EU Presidency, sourcing sufficient suitably experienced staff has presented major challenges.  </p><p>  Under the relevant Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circular, the operation of the career break scheme is subject to the operating requirements of the Department not being adversely affected.  Discretionary release of experienced staff, without the ability to replace them, would have a very negative impact on the Department&rsquo;s capacity to deliver on its responsibilities in the period leading up to and during the EU Presidency.  Accordingly, the Department concluded last January that it simply had no available alternative but to temporarily suspend the career break facility, other than in the most exceptional circumstances.  The position will be reviewed at the end of the Presidency in mid-2013 in the light of the Department&rsquo;s business requirements at that time.</p></reply>

AMRFs form part of the options introduced by Finance Act 1999 to provide control, flexibility and choice to certain individuals in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans. Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension under a defined contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible  tax-free lump sum. </p><p>  The choices which then became available included the existing option to purchase an annuity with those remaining funds, and new options to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. Access to these flexible options was extended to all main benefits from retirement benefit schemes (other than Defined Benefit arrangements) in Finance Act 2011.</p><p>  Under the regime the options to</p><p>- invest in an ARF, or</p><p>- receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate)</p><p>are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&ldquo;specified income&rdquo;) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option (subject to tax), that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement.</p><p>  Finance Act 2011 increased the specified income limit from the previous fixed amount of &euro;12,700 per annum introduced in 1999, and unchanged since that time, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) bringing the specified income limit to &euro;18,000 per annum at present.  However, as a transitional measure, Finance Act 2011 allows the previous lower guaranteed income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum to continue to apply for a period of 3 years from the date that Act was signed into law (6 February 2011), including for individuals who had retired before that date and who already had an AMRF.</p><p>  The State Pension (Contributory) would count towards meeting the specified income limit.  You should note, however, that only guaranteed pension income paid to the individual in his or her own right can be taken into account for this purpose. Pensions paid directly to the spouse of an individual or pensions/allowances received on behalf of a spouse or dependant may not be included.</p><p>  Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount must be invested. The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; throughout the latter period of their retirement for individuals with pension income below the specified income limit.  Prior to Finance Act 2011, the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount was fixed at the first &euro;63,500 of the pension fund or the remainder of the fund after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less than &euro;63,500. Finance Act 2011 increased the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount to 10 times the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory) &ndash; &euro;119,800 at present &ndash; or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less. The capital in an AMRF is not available to an individual until he or she reaches 75 years though any income generated by the fund can be drawn down subject to tax. The capital in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase an annuity and the AMRF can be changed to an ARF with access to the capital sum (subject to taxation) before the age of 75 where the specified income test is met before that age.</p><p>  These are the various requirements around the operation of the options at retirement for those with Retirement Annuity Contracts, Personal Retirement Savings Accounts and other defined contribution pension arrangements and the reasons for those requirements.  While I am not in possession of all of the relevant personal details of your constituent&rsquo;s case which would impact on the scope of the options available to your constituent, and subject to that very important caveat, the following options may be available with regard to the AMRF, other than to leave the capital sum until age 75:</p><p>  - The use of the AMRF funds to purchase a pension annuity.</p><p>  - If your constituent is in receipt of the State Pension (Contributory), the amount of that pension in payment to him/her in his/her own right (excluding any amount in respect of a dependent) would count towards meeting the annual specified income test which in this case could be &euro;12,700 at this point in time. The funds in the AMRF could be used to purchase a pension annuity equivalent to the difference between the relevant State Pension amount and &euro;12,700. Any remaining funds in the AMRF would then be available as an ARF and could be withdrawn as a lump sum amount subject to income tax at your constituent&rsquo;s marginal rate.</p></reply>

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.</p><p>  The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</p><p>  It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol cannot be deducted/reclaimed.  There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. </p></reply>

The income tax for 2010 paid by individuals engaged in specialist medical practice activities amounted to close on &#8364;100 million representing an average effective tax rate of 29.7%, which is calculated as the percentage of total tax liability to gross income. It should be noted that gross income is as defined in Revenue Statistical Report 2010. This figure is derived from the details of personal income tax returns filed for the year 2010, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available. </p><p><br />  You may wish to note that the sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4 digit &#8220;NACE code (Rev. 2)&#8221; which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources within the Revenue Commissioners. NACE code classifications on tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf and the taxes collected are allocated to those codes without reference to the precise economic activity which generated them. </p><p><br />  While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level.

The Domicile Levy was introduced in Finance Act 2010 and was charged on an individual:</p><p>- who in any year is Irish domiciled and an Irish citizen,</p><p>- whose worldwide income for the year exceeds &euro;1m,</p><p>- whose Irish located property in the year is greater than &euro;5m, and</p><p>- whose liability to Irish income tax for the year is less than &euro;200,000.</p><p>  Where a relevant person has paid income tax that person is entitled to a credit for the tax paid in calculating the amount of the Domicile Levy.</p><p>  The amendment introduced in section 136 Finance Act 2012 removed the requirement to be an Irish citizen.  The effect of this amendment is that persons who meet the other criteria will be liable to the levy whether or not they are Irish citizens.  The returns for the tax year 2012 will be the first returns affected by the amendment.  These returns are due to be filed on or before 31 October 2013.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that no returns in relation to the Domicile Levy for the tax year 2012 have been filed to date.  It is not possible at this point to determine how many persons this measure will affect for the tax year 2012.</p><p>  The only year for which Domicile Levy returns have been filed is the tax year 2010.  These returns were due on 31 October 2011.  In all, 11 returns have been filed in relation to the Domicile Levy for 2010 and the tax paid was &euro;1,667,011.  The levy applies to both resident and non-resident individuals who meet the above criteria.  Based on information available to Revenue, eight individuals who filed Domicile Levy returns for 2010 are not resident in Ireland for tax purposes.  The number of persons who have filed income tax returns for 2010, the latest year for which figures are available, indicating that they are non-resident is 10,781.  Many non-resident individuals who file Irish tax returns would have a foreign domicile and accordingly would not be liable for the Domicile Levy.</p><p>  The Programme for Government update in March 2012 confirmed the commitment to undertake a consultation process on residence issues in 2012 to inform preparation for further changes in 2013. I launched a public consultation on tax residence rules in May this year, wherein I invited interested parties to make submissions on possible revisions to the current residence rules for the taxation of individuals.  This consultation process has now concluded.  A total of eight submissions have been received and these will be published in due course, as indicated when the consultation was announced.  My officials are considering the submissions and will be advising me on possible further changes as part of the preparations for Budget 2013.</p></reply>

IT controls also ensure that data cannot be saved from the NTMA network onto external storage devices, such as USB keys, CDs, etc. I am advised that the Board of NAMA is currently reviewing the findings of a recent investigation by Deloitte and, as part of that review, will assess the implications in terms of NAMA&rsquo;s current data control procedures.</p><p>  Employees assigned by NTMA to NAMA are bound by a number of statutory obligations in respect of the confidentiality of information to which they have access by virtue of their employment by NAMA. These include obligations imposed under Section 14 (1) of the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 and under Section 202 of the NAMA Act 2009. NAMA staff are also subject to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act 1963.

For these reasons, Revenue focuses on deterring shadow/hidden economy activity and non-compliance through its audit and investigation programmes based on risk analysis, use of Revenue powers and their intelligence and information systems.   Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through its range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue&#8217;s assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available. Revenue is using a wide range of methodologies to identify those operating in the shadow economy and is deploying the full range of compliance interventions. Activities can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre arranged aspect queries on specific items. This work is continuing.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioner&#8217;s approach to the shadow economy is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with the Department of Social Protection. The primary objective of these activities is to uncover either non-declaration<b></b>  or under declaration of income and/or fraudulent DSP claims.</p><p><br />  The Deputy will be aware of the continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax and duty evasion, including recent provisions relating to: - </p><p> - The making of returns of transactions by merchant acquirers, and other payment settlement entities, to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p> - The more effective investigation of white-collar crime.</p><p><br />  Further provisions included a comprehensive package of measures in relation to Excise (Oils) including, requirement for separate licences for auto-fuel traders and marked fuel traders, requirement to have a separate licence for every premises or place at which the fuel concerned is dealt in, and a requirement that a licence must be clearly displayed at the premises or place.</p><p><br />  Revenue&#8217;s tobacco strategy, &#8220;Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011- 2013)&#8221; was published on the Revenue website in June 2011. This three-year strategy is underpinned by annual action plans. </p><p><br />  The strategic level plans include taking steps to ensure that the legitimate trade remains compliant, delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of Revenue resources. The strategy also include further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at national and international level, together with a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.</p><p><br />  During 2011 Revenue&#8217;s Customs Service seized a total of 109 million cigarettes in 10,581 seizures. Commercial quantities in maritime freight traffic accounted for 76.4 million cigarettes. Revenue also seized 11,158 kg of tobacco in 2011. In six particular operations, over 19 million cigarettes, 1,344 kg tobacco and 49 vehicles were seized.</p><p><br />  Regulations were also introduced in 2011 requiring Government Departments and State Bodies to supply details of payments made to the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this data is matched to the Revenue records of the various recipients, and is used to profile risk. Similar matching is also carried out using other third party data received by the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p><br />  Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses. All possible sources of information, including following up on services advertised on TV, radio, local newspapers, Internet, special interest publications are used by Revenue. </p><p><br />  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that in order to inform the approaches they are taking, and help determine where resources may best be deployed, they continue to engage in meetings with trade and representative bodies. The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group provides a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy. This group, which is chaired by Revenue, includes representatives from employer and business organisations, trade unions and other Government Departments and agencies. Regional hidden economy liaison groups have been established to facilitate greater local interaction and more immediate responses to insights and issues that may be highlighted. </p><p><br />  Revenue investigations have detected the use of computer programmes or electronic devices to alter or conceal sales records. To counteract these risks, legislation was enacted in 2011 providing penalties for the possession, use or supply of automated sales suppression devices known as &quot;zappers&quot; for the purpose of evading tax. </p><p><br />  Streetscape programmes, in which every cash business in an area is visited, without prior announcement, have been carried out. While the main focus of real time activity is on businesses that use cash registers, all sectors that have cash receipts are monitored. This includes professionals such as doctors, veterinary surgeons, etc.  These operations have also resulted in the registration of previously unregistered persons. 803 such registrations were recorded in the period from January to the end of April 2012.</p><p><br />  The results from all the various projects are reflected in the general audit and compliance results from audits, assurance checks, site visits etc. which are published in the Revenue Annual Report.</p></reply>

This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.   The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State. This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. </p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which was published in July, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. </p><p>  I am hopeful that by including the high-growth area of the betting sector the tax base from betting will be boosted significantly.</p><p>  In addition, this measure conveys a positive signal to international betting operations that have expressed an interest in or have already invested in Ireland. A location with an appropriate licensing regime coupled with relatively low taxes provides real investment and employment opportunities in this sector, which ultimately can potentially be beneficial to all concerned.  Clearly any betting operations which do choose to invest in Ireland would be subject to all other aspects of the taxation regime such as corporation tax, income tax, VAT etc.</p></reply>

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.   I assume from the Deputy&rsquo;s question that he is proposing that retirement lump sums in excess of &euro;150,000 be taxed as outlined above. As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;150,000.</p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just under 2,500 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &euro;100,000 and less than &euro;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000. If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &euro;150,000 at 20% could be less than &euro;0.5 m in a full year.</p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. This option is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</p></reply>

It is offered to each party after the internal complaints procedure of a financial services provider (e.g. Bank) has been exhausted by the complainant.  There is no obligation on either party to accept the offer of mediation. The Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau has advised me that, in the majority of cases, it is not taken up by either party.  The Bureau does not keep a record of refusals by banks to proceed to mediation.</p><p>Since the Financial Services Ombudsman commenced processing complaints in 2005, mediation was offered in each case. In 2011, 15 cases were referred to full mediation i.e. where the two parties met with a mediator. I have also been advised that a total of only 23 cases were ever resolved through mediation.

The scheme also permits employers to take a double deduction for the salary of the employee when calculating profits for the purpose of taxation.   This incentive applies in respect of individuals who have been unemployed for at least 12 months and are in receipt of a specified social protection payment or, who are in a category approved for the purposes of the scheme by the Minister for Social Protection with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Disability benefit and disability allowance are both qualifying payments for the purposes of this scheme.</p><p><br />  The scheme is designed to help the long-term unemployed get back into paid employment by helping to ensure that the income earned from that employment is greater than could be obtained by staying on welfare payments. The additional income deductions are gradually reduced over the three year period.</p><p><br />  To amend the scheme such that the disabled would retain access to the additional income deductions in perpetuity would go beyond the objectives of the scheme.</p><p><br />  I would point out that if an individual is in receipt of certain disability payments, they may be allowed to do work or training and keep their payment or part-payment on the grounds that it is considered rehabilitative or therapeutic.</p><p><br />  People with disabilities are, in general, liable to pay tax on their incomes in the same way as everyone else. The tax system does however provide additional tax credits and exempts certain incomes from tax for persons with disabilities of a permanent nature.</p><p><br />  Anyone who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally, where he or she is unable to maintain himself or herself, may be able to claim one or more of the additional tax credits available. In addition, parents/guardians and persons who care for dependent relatives may also qualify for some of the relevant tax credits, which are set out below:</p><p><b>Incapacitated Child Tax Credit</b> - can be claimed by a parent in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself and had become so before reaching 21 years of age or finishing full-time education or full-time training for a trade or profession. <i><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT18 - Incapacitated Child Tax Credit</font></i>  )</p><p><b>Note:</b> One Parent Family Tax Credit may also be claimed by a single parent (whether widowed, separated, deserted, single or divorced) with an incapacitated child. This credit can be claimed regardless of whether you have already claimed the incapacitated child tax credit.   <i><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT9 - One-Parent Family Tax Credit)</font></i></p><p><b>Blind Person&#8217;s Tax Credit </b>-is due to a person who is regarded as blind. If two people, who are regarded as blind, are married, they can each qualify for this tax credit.   <i><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT35 - Blind Persons&#8217; Tax Credits &amp; Reliefs)</font></i></p><p><b>Employed person taking care of an Incapacitated individual</b> - an incapacitated person who employs someone to care for himself, herself or a relative can claim for the cost of the employment.   <i><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT47 - Employed person taking care of an Incapacitated individual)</font></i></p><p><b>Covenants</b> - relief is available in respect of a properly drawn up Deed of Covenant in favour of a permanently incapacitated individual. However, parents cannot covenant to a permanently incapacitated minor child i.e. under 18 years of age and unmarried.  <i><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT7 - Covenants to Individuals</font></i></p><p><b>Medical Expenses Relief</b> - is available in respect of un-reimbursed nursing home, doctors&#8217;, hospital and other health expenses.  <i><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT6 - Health / Medical Expenses Relief)</font></i></p><p><br />  The following sources of income and gains are exempt from Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax for people with incapacities, provided they are included in their annual return of income:</p><p><b>Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</b> - if you are permanently incapacitated or over 65 years of age you could be entitled to a refund of DIRT deducted, provided your gross income is exempt from tax or is marginally over the exemption limit.   <i><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT8 - Tax Exemption &amp; Marginal Relief)</font></i></p><p><b>Leasing of Farmland</b>   - rent from farmland can be exempt if you are permanently incapacitated from carrying on the trade, provided certain conditions are met.</p><p><b>Payments to or in respect of Thalidomide Persons</b>   Payments made by the Department of Health and Children or the Hilfswerk F&uuml;r Behinderte Kinder Foundation are exempt from income tax. Also exempt is any income arising from the investment of these payments, for example deposit interest, rental income, dividend income, etc. With effect from 1 January 2004, any gains arising from the disposal of assets acquired with such payments or with such an investment is exempt from Capital Gains Tax.</p><p><b>Personal Injury Compensation Payments</b> Certain compensation payments received are exempt from Income Tax. Also exempt is income arising from the investment of such payments, and with effect from 1 January 2004, gains arising on the disposal of assets acquired with such payments or the investment of such payments, provided the aggregate of the gains and income exceeds 50% of the aggregate of the person&#8217;s total income and gains. The injury must have given rise to a permanent and total mental or physical incapacity which prevents the person from maintaining himself or herself.   <i><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT 13 - Personal Injury Compensation Payments)</font></i></p><p><b>Compensation payments made by the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal</b>   - are exempt from income tax.

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.    The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</p><p>  It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol can not be deducted/reclaimed. </p><p>  There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. 	</p></reply>

Once a site has been procured, the project will proceed to architectural planning and the appointment of a design team.  A building project for an 8 classroom school would be generally expected to take between 30 and 36 months from the time of appointment of a design team to the completion of construction. However, the exact timeframe will be dependent on a number of factors including the granting of planning permission for the proposed building.

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world. The international panel of education experts who prepared the report recommended that teacher education be provided in six "centres for teacher education".  The new collaborations recommended will mean that a smaller number of publicly funded centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education. These centres will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.</p><p>  Only publicly funded HEIs are included in the proposed new collaborations. Private providers of ITE exist outside this framework but are subject to the same accreditation requirements by the Teaching Council. There are no immediate impacts for students presently pursuing or intent on pursuing courses with private teacher training colleges. However, the report also makes various comments and recommendations on matters such as overall teacher supply and I intend to explore these further with the HEA, the Teaching Council, and the initial teacher education providers, as appropriate.</p></reply>

The Government decision confirmed that the number of VECs would be reduced to 16 but involves different mergers to those announced by the previous Government. <br />  In October 2011 the General Scheme of an Education and Training Boards Bill was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education. The General Scheme was also published at that time. Following discussions with this Department and relevant stakeholders, the Committee <br />prepared a report which I responded to at a meeting of the Committee on 25 January 2012. The General Scheme was then referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for formal drafting. It is hoped that the Bill will be published in the very near future.<br />  Also in October 2011, my Department concluded an agreement with SIPTU, the trade union representing the Chief Executive Officers of VECs, on a redeployment scheme for CEOs in the context of the Croke Park agreement. This scheme is being used, in the first instance, for determining the appointment of CEOs to the new Education and Training Boards, following the enactment of the relevant legislation.<br />  Arising from the implementation of the scheme, CEO Designates have been assigned to 14 of the 16 new Education and Training Boards.<br />  Each CEO Designate will be tasked, in addition to performing the functions appropriate to the grade of CEO within the VEC in which s/he is currently employed, with liaising with the CEOs and Vocational Education Committees of each of the constituent VECs in the proposed new body to maximise cohesion between the constituent VECs prior to establishment day and to facilitate the merger.  No additional allowance will be paid for the duration of assignment as <br />CEO Designate.<br />  Appointments of CEO of the proposed Education and Training Boards will occur <br />following enactment of the relevant legislation.<br />  No assignment of CEO Designate has been made for the Co. Kerry Education and Training Board.  Ms Jacinta Stewart, the current CEO in the City of Dublin VEC will be appointed as the CEO of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board following the establishment of the new Board.<br />  A list of the education and training boards together with the assigned CEO <br />Designates is contained on the attached table.</p><p><b>CEOs Designate assigned</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Education &amp; Training Board</b></th><th><b>CEO Designate</b></th></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>(Name of CEO)</td></tr><tr><td>City of Cork  and Co.

This programme provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period. Interns receive an allowance of &euro;50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement. In the event that a primary teacher, who is conditionally registered with the Teaching council and who obtains a placement in an internship, can meet the conditions associated with the operation of the primary probationary process as outlined in circular 47/2011, there will be nothing to preclude him or her from applying to be probated. Limerick Education Centre administers the probationary process on behalf of the Inspectorate and applications for the evaluation of professional competence aspect of the probationary process should be addressed to Limerick Education Centre.</p></reply>

The Request for Tender for MPS was advertised, in accordance with the EC Procurement Directives, on e-Tenders and in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU).  15 tender responses were received, of which seven tenderers were selected to be Framework Members.  The Framework Agreement for MPS was established on 8 February 2012.  The Framework Agreement will be in place for two years, with an option to extend for a further two years. </p><p><br />  Four of the successful tenderers are indigenous small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (MJ Flood, Bryan S Ryan, Hibernian Business Equipment and Ergo). The Framework Members have also indicated in their tender submissions that they will use a further 11 indigenous SMEs in the delivery of MPS. </p><p><br />  MPS is a unique office print solution, where a supplier provides an all inclusive service based on an on-going per click charge, that includes the provision of print/imaging devices at no capital cost to the public sector body.  The supplier, in effect, provides the full infrastructure required for all day-to-day office printing.  Research carried out by the National Procurement Service (NPS) has indicated that such an approach gives best value to the Irish public sector. Some of the smaller suppliers do not have the resources to provide such infrastructure themselves, but they can have roles within the supply networks of the seven Framework Members.  </p><p><br />  The majority of public sector bodies currently have <i>ad-hoc</i> print arrangements in place.  A typical Government office has multiple print and imaging devices such as photocopiers, scanners and faxes.  These devices can potentially come from a wide range of different suppliers with separate supply and servicing arrangements.  The ratio of print devices to staff is often in the region of 1:2 and in some cases as low as 1:1 where a large number of staff have their own desktop printer.  </p><p><br />  Circular 6/12 specifies that the MPS Framework is mandatory from 1 September 2012.  However, it is important to note that this Framework is only mandatory where a public sector body opts for an MPS solution. If a public sector body simply wishes to purchase a printer or a photocopier they do not have to use the MPS Framework.  It is a matter for each public sector body to determine which route offers the best value for their organisation.</p></reply>

The relevant provisions of the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006 hold that where an employee, who was required to hold an Employment Permit, has failed to do so then he or she is guilty of an offence.  Furthermore, while an employer may also be guilty of an offence in this matter, Justice Hogan points out that the legislation provides for a defence with regard to an employer but fails to do so with regard to an employee.</p><p>  As I understand it, this lack of defence affects the courts&rsquo; scope to interpret the statutory provisions and compels the court to hold that the legislation has created an absolute offence so far as an employee is concerned.  Importantly, Justice Hogan found that it must therefore be taken that the Oireachtas intended that such a non-national employee automatically commits an offence if he or she does not have a work permit irrespective of the reasons for that failure and that this has implications so far as the civil law is concerned in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void.</p><p>  The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such non-nationals should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so versus to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. </p><p>  The Deputy will recognise that this question requires careful consideration as the applicability of rights in one context can have far reaching consequences beyond that originally intended.</p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department is treating the matter with the utmost importance and that I would expect proposals on the matter within the coming months.</p></reply>

The new jobs are being supported by IDA Ireland.  The jobs announced will come on stream within a 3 to 5 year period, in line with the company&rsquo;s business plan, and will be filled by the appropriately qualified personnel.  Building on the foundation of its existing facility, EA will now provide multilingual international customer support and services for its major game titles.   EA has stated that the European Customer Experience Centre is a key element of its strategy to serve gamers on a global basis. The company wishes to engage with its worldwide customer base on a 24/7 basis, across all of EA&rsquo;s games and services and in multiple languages in today&rsquo;s fast-moving digital environment.   I am delighted that this is another vote of confidence by a major player in the Games Sector in the attractiveness and competitiveness of Ireland as an investment location and in Galway as a location of choice. </p></reply>

As independent quasi-judicial bodies, I have no role in the day-to-day exercise of their functions.     </p><p>  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntarist in nature; the LRC cannot compel any party to a dispute to attend a hearing/meeting.  The LRC does not have any jurisdiction to adjudicate on disputes in relation to redundancy payments. </p><p>  The EAT is an independent body bound to act judicially and was set up to provide a speedy, fair, inexpensive and informal means for individuals to seek remedies for alleged infringement of their statutory rights.  The EAT has jurisdiction to deal with and adjudicate on disputes under a number of pieces of legislation including the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 1997 and the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Acts 1984 to 1994.   The Redundancy Acts provide that all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum upon being made redundant.  The latter Act provides for the protection of employees&rsquo; entitlements in regard to matters relating to pay (e.g. arrears of wages, holiday pay etc.) in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  The Act also provides that disputes concerning some of these entitlements may be referred to the EAT.  </p><p>  The EAT currently has the power to compel any person (including the director(s) of  a company) to attend a hearing to give evidence and to produce any documents in his/her possession, custody or control, relating to any matter referred to the Tribunal, including complaints referred under the aforementioned legislation. A person who fails to attend a hearing in response to such a notice from the EAT or who refuses to give evidence or to produce any required documents will be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine.  The EAT also has the power to take evidence on oath and may administer oaths to persons attending as witnesses.  Penalties are prescribed by law for wilful and corrupt perjury by any person convicted in a Court of Law giving false evidence or wilfully or corruptly swearing anything, which is false as a hearing of the EAT.  </p><p>  It is entirely a matter for the Tribunal, having regard to the circumstances of any particular case, to determine whether or not to invoke its powers to compel a witness to attend a hearing in order to give evidence. </p><p>  I have no plans to introduce legislation amending the existing rules concerning the compellability of witnesses to either the EAT or LRC.  However, as you may be aware, I am currently undertaking a root and branch reform of the existing Workplace Relations Bodies. The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the LRC, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the EAT and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  It is intended that Adjudication Officers in the new WRC will also have the power to compel witnesses to attend hearings to give evidence.</p></reply>

The company plans to sell as a going concern their European business interests in this sector which includes the manufacturing plant in Killorglin, Co. Kerry and a sales and R&amp;D facility in Germany.  Management confirmed that the plant will close by the end of 2012 with the loss of 30 jobs if a sale is not successfully concluded by then.  Staff at the company have been informed of the decision to sell the operation and of the consequence of not being successful in this planned sale. Management will begin a formal process of consultation with staff and unions in the next few days.    </p><p>  As a result of the construction downturn in the US and Europe, the company have decided to consolidate their business units and concentrate on the market for traditional products and markets in the timber frame sector. The construction downturn has led to the Killorglin facility being on a 3 day week for much of the past 3 years.  The building and land is owned by the company and IDA Ireland is aware that the company has engaged consultants to market both land and equipment as a going concern.  IDA will continue to work with the company in their search for a new owner/purchaser to sustain the facility and staff.     IDA will also look for opportunities to market the building through its overseas network. </p><p>  Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies - IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland - will be critical in achieving economic growth. These activities will, in turn, create and protect existing jobs in the area.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. </p><p><br />  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p><br />  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.</p><p><br />  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main recognised accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. </p><p><br />  The advisory framework has commenced with practicing accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  </p><p><br />  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers.  It is intended to review the operation of the advisory framework in June 2013 at which point other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.   </p><p>The accountancy bodies have already notified their members about the new service with a view to having the panel in place before the end of September. The panel will be available on a county by county basis and the details will be available on the website <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p></reply>

The group has also been asked to liaise with the Advisory Group on Tax and Welfare in the context of their review of DA/DCA issues and incorporate any relevant findings into the administrative arrangements for the DCA scheme and having considered these issues, to recommend whether any legislative changes are required in relation to the scheme and whether the current operation of the scheme needs further refinement to meet the overall policy objectives.</p><p>  It would not be appropriate to comment on the potential recommendations of the group until they have completed their work and their report has been duly considered.

Internship opportunities can vary significantly spanning many occupations/disciplines from high skill specialist placements to lower skilled general placements.  The principal aim of internships advertised is to provide interns with an opportunity to keep close to the labour market while gaining valuable experience in a working environment and thus enabling them to increase the knowledge and skills required to explore a new career path or enhance their career prospects and build their confidence through work experience.  </p><p>  The scheme has made significant progress to-date.  Our records indicate that a significant proportion of individuals have progressed into employment across various occupations/ disciplines on completion of their internship placements.  To ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the JobBridge team are involved in the continuous monitoring of internships.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the Internship.</p><p>  All internships advertised on the JobBridge website clearly state &ldquo;This is an internship.  An allowance of &euro;50 per week will be paid in addition to your current social welfare payment.  See eligibility criteria above.&rdquo; </p></reply>

For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence condition.  In the case of the insurance based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records. It should also be noted that many factors outside the Department's control can impact upon claim processing times, for example, the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers or other third parties. </p><p>  The average processing time for claims decided in August 2012 was 2.3 weeks for jobseekers benefit, 4.5 weeks for jobseekers allowance and 12.2 weeks for one parent family payment. This is the average time nationally and there are fluctuations between offices.</p><p>  The number of claims pending decision at week ending 16 September was 6,523 jobseekers benefit, 22,753 jobseekers allowance and 3,625 one-parent family payment.</p></reply>

The process of integration is on-going and significant progress has already been made with a unified service, the National Employment and Entitlements Service, now in the process of being delivered in four offices. The service provided in relation to processing mortgage interest and rent supplement applications is also subject to ongoing review.</p><p>  The timescale for determining applications for rent and mortgage interest supplements is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements etc. In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</p><p>  Statistics are not available on the length of time taken to assess rent and mortgage interest supplement applications or the number of applications awaiting a decision. The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with rent and mortgage interest supplement applications. This is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with these applications make every effort to ensure rent and mortgage interest supplement claims are processed in an efficient manner.</p></reply>

The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.</p><p><br />  The Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS in light of the current waiting times, including the assignment of temporary staff and the facility to assign overtime working where appropriate.  Furthermore an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has commenced for the FIS scheme, the focus of which will be to optimise performance and provide improved customer service.</p><p><br />  These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand.

Average time to award is currently 33 weeks, this includes the time taken to decide EU and bilateral cases which have a significantly longer processing time.</p><p>  Since the introduction of the two year expiration of illness benefit there has been a significant increase in the number of IP claims received in the Department.  A high percentage of these applicants are not suitable for the invalidity pension scheme as they are not assessed as being permanently incapable of work.</p><p>  Since June of this year, following an in-depth business process improvement project in the invalidity pension area, a targeted plan has been put in place to clear the backlog.  The number of claims awaiting decision is steadily decreasing e.g. from 7,007 at end May, 6,285 at end July to 5,802 at end August 2012.  However it will be a number of months before the backlog of claims is fully cleared.</p><p>  The processing time for individual IP claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the qualifying criteria.  In addition, factors outside the Department&rsquo;s control can have an impact, for example, insufficient information received from claimants at time of application and delays in claimants furnishing the information requested.</p><p>  Customers waiting on a decision on their IP claim, who have urgent income support needs, can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance (SWA).</p></reply>

It is acknowledged, however, that there are several hundred cases which have been on hand for a longer period.  These are very large scale cases which are put through additional checks and, therefore, take longer to process.

One of the contribution conditions for invalidity pension is that the claimant must have 48 contributions paid or credited in the last complete contribution year before the date of claim.  Class A, E or H contributions only are reckonable for invalidity pension purposes.  An application for invalidity pension was received from the person concerned.  According to the department&rsquo;s records the person concerned has only 2 qualifying contributions paid in 2011, the governing contribution year in this case and consequently his claim was refused by a deciding officer. The applicant was notified on 21 September 2012 and advised of his right to review or appeal this decision.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided &euro;436m in 2012.</p><p>  Standards for rented houses are set in regulations by the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Responsibility for enforcing these standards rests with the relevant housing authority.  In consultation with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, S.I. No. 572 of 2006 and Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 introduced the condition that allows the Department&rsquo;s officers to decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority of the non-compliance with standards.  Where such a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, it is recommended that the officer would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action they decide is necessary in the best interests of the tenant. Department officers dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  This approach supports the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in their aim to promote further improvement in private rented accommodation standards.</p></reply>

The &euro;100 rate does not apply to certain categories of claimant including:</p><p>-  claimants with a qualified child;</p><p>-  those transferring to Jobseeker's Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit;</p><p>-  those making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker's Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;</p><p>- those transferring directly to Jobseeker's Allowance from Disability Allowance and</p><p>-  certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before s/he reached the age of 18.</p><p>  A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.</p><p>  Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.  While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to find employment over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.</p><p>  Where a person is in receipt of a rate of Jobseeker's Allowance described above and s/he participates in a course of education, training, community employment, rural social scheme or T&uacute;s, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.</p><p>  I understand that a number of Deputies have been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  My officials have engaged in constructive dialogue with Focus Ireland with regard to their concerns.  As part of this work, Focus Ireland has recently supplied my Department with details from their network organisations of relevant individual cases.</p><p>  This information is currently being examined and my Department will engage in further discussions with Focus Ireland.  These discussions will seek to achieve a satisfactory resolution of any issues arising in respect of these persons, while also preserving the integrity of the social welfare system and avoiding any potential drift towards welfare dependency.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-25a.569.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092500069#WRO02100"><p>Reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty is a fundamental aspiration of Irish society and the Programme for Government states that the elimination of poverty is an objective of this Government.  The national social target for poverty reduction provides a key reference point for government policies and offers a tangible benchmark against which to measure social and economic progress.</p><p><br />  Given the challenging economic and fiscal context, the Government initiated a comprehensive review of the national poverty target, first set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion<i></i>in 2007, in order to ensure that it remained appropriate and achievable.  I will shortly be publishing the result of the outcome of the review and following that will make arrangements for appropriate consultation with stakeholders to discuss how best to implement its recommendations.</p><p><br />  Notwithstanding this, I should point out that in advance of the publication of the review, the revised targets were set out in a document submitted to the European Commission in April 2012 entitled the &quot;National Reform Programme for Ireland 2012 Update under the Europe 2020 Strategy&quot; and are available on the website of the Department of An Taoiseach.  In that update, the Government indicated that it had decided to revise and enhance its national poverty target to meet Ireland&#8217;s contribution to Europe 2020 and commitments in the Programme for Government.  The revised target is to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 (interim target) and to 2 per cent or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.2 per cent.  Ireland&#8217;s revised contribution to the overall EU poverty target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of the risk of poverty or exclusion between 2012 and 2020.  I want to stress that the revised targets still mean that the Government has retained the ambition of the original target, despite the difficult economic conditions.  The target will now be achieved over an extended timeframe of 2020, in line with the EU timescale.  In addition, the Government has agreed a number of other changes which will have a positive impact for poverty reduction, notably the adoption of sub-targets for children and jobless/low-work intensity households and new supporting indicators.</p><p><br />  The Government and I, as Minister for Social Protection, are determined to ensure that the least well off in society are protected from the economic crisis and are enabled to benefit from economic recovery and new employment opportunities.  I look forward to working with all stakeholders to implement the revised and enhanced national social target for poverty reduction.</p></reply>

Available surpluses (if any) of salmon are calculated for each individual river annually.  </p><p>  The annual surplus of salmon available on the River Maine is divided between the commercial and recreational anglers.  I am advised by IFI that any extension to the recreational angling season would need to be based on scientific analysis of available surplus, catch returns, counter information, run timing, exploitation rates etc.  With the majority of these parameters the time series of available data is considered by IFI to be too short to draw any meaningful scientific conclusions and therefore, in line with the conservation Imperative based on the precautionary principle, no recommendation can be made for an extension to the salmon angling season at this time.  </p><p>  The independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for salmon provide advice on the criteria that should be evaluated when considering a proposal for an extension to the angling season in any salmon catchment.  These criteria include the advice that, where an extension is being considered, there should be a reasonably sized quota and a reasonable proportion of the surplus remaining after the original season has ended to ensure essential recruitment and to avoid over fishing.  A further criterion is that an angling season in a river should only be extended if the salmon stock in that river has been meeting the Conservation Limit (CL) and is likely to continue to meet the CL if an extension is given i.e. provided no more than the harvestable surplus is taken.  2012 is only the third year where a full assessment of the salmon run on the river Maine is available.  A higher salmon surplus and a longer time period of fish counter data would be required before the SSC criteria can be adequately assessed.   </p></reply>

There is no Gate 4 at present and this area will not be developed until the uptake of Gate 3 offers is clearer.</p><p>  The current round of offers for connection to the electricity networks is known as Gate 3. 3900 MW of offers was issued by the System Operators (EirGrid for connection to the transmission system and ESB Networks for connection to the distribution system) in 2010 and 2011 in line with policy and rules set out by the CER.  These offers are currently being considered by the developers who have received an offer.  Some developers have accepted their offer, however, the majority have not accepted (or indeed rejected) their offer yet.  This is because developers do not have to accept or reject their offer until they receive their final constraint and curtailment report from EirGrid.  </p><p>  These reports cannot be developed until the Single Electricity Market Committee (SEMC) policy on tie-breaks in dispatch has been completed.  This piece of all island work involves examining the appropriate rule-set to share the burden of constraints and curtailment.  The SEMC has made a decision (SM-11-105) in relation to constraints but is still considering the appropriate course of action in relation to curtailment of wind.  It is likely that this policy will be completed by end 2012 or early 2013.  This will then allow EirGrid to prepare the constraint and curtailment reports, issue them to all Gate 3 developers and for developers to then accept or reject their offer.</p><p>Following this, there will be a good indication of the level of Gate 3 offers being accepted by developers. The policy on any future Gate beyond that will consider issues such as the level of capacity available on the networks, Ireland&rsquo;s progress towards meeting its 2020 renewable targets when Gate 3 contribution is considered and the appropriate connection rules in order to ensure efficient connection to the networks.  The CER will carry out full consultations on all aspects of Gate 4 policy at the appropriate time.  </p></reply>

The installations have been subject to an 18 month monitoring period since January 2011.  SEAI have provided an interim report on the monitoring to my Department and a final report on the trials will be presented before end 2012.  I will discuss with SEAI the options for publication of this report, when finalised.</p><p>  The Department has asked SEAI to update some initial information on feed-in-tariff costs, given how significantly solar PV costs have fallen globally in the last 2 years.  While the Programme for Government proposes a microgeneration feed in tariff not significantly above the single energy market price for electricity, indications from the combined ESB Networks/Electric Ireland microgeneration programme that ran 2009-2011 were that there was only a modest take up of microgeneration in the domestic sector, although the feed in tariff offered in total was almost three times the current single electricity market price.  Should a scheme be introduced, if this to be funded from the PSO levy, increased electricity costs would have to be borne by all customers to fund it.  </p><p>My Department and SEAI are continuing to finalise analysis on the cost effective options which could be considered for supporting the micro-generation sector, having regard to the costs and benefits for all energy consumers. </p></reply>

They have chosen to do this in two ways &#8211; using both a digital terrestrial network and also using satellite.  Their satellite service, Freesat, is intended to provide for reception to the UK only but also covers Ireland through overspill.</p><p><br />  In order to overcome copyright issues which are associated with broadcasting, the UK channels must purchase the rights to show their acquired content in Ireland as well as the UK.  The copyright costs are proportional to TV viewer numbers so the additional cost for acquiring the rights to broadcast in Ireland is small.  As an alternative approach, the UK could choose to encrypt the satellite service so that it could not be received in Ireland or elsewhere.</p><p><br />  For the Irish channels to be freely available on the same satellite as the UK channels, the issue of copyright also arises.  Irish stations would need to acquire copyright throughout the footprint area of the satellite, in the UK as well as Ireland, or to provide an encrypted service.  RT&Eacute; has informed us that both options are prohibitively expensive and that they have no plans to seek to place Saorview channels on Freesat.</p><p>In Ireland RT&Eacute; has chosen to build its free to air digital network over two platforms - over a digital terrestrial network (SAORVIEW) and over satellite (SAORSAT).  SAORVIEW is available to 98% of the population whilst SAORSAT has 100% coverage, covering only Ireland.</p><p><br />  RT&Eacute; has informed us that with SAORSAT it is possible to pick up the UK Freesat TV channels as well as the Irish TV channels by using a second  Low Noise Block Down converter Feedhorn (LNBF) which is correctly aligned.

Under the legislation, it is a function of a local authority to collect the household charges and associated late payment penalties due to it and all such charges and late payment penalties imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Section 7 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983 provides that where a sum is due to a local authority in respect of a charge under any enactment and at the same time, another sum is due by the local authority to the same person, the local authority may set-off the money owing to it against the money it pays out. Local authorities are thus legally empowered to withhold money due to an individual if that person owes unpaid charges to the local authority . However, this does not apply to higher education grants, which are administered by local authorities on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Student Support Act 2011 does not provide for withholding the payment of a student grant on foot of non-payment of the household charge.  </p><p>I am aware that Clare County Council recently issued letters in relation to the disbursal of higher education grants and asked in the letter for applicants to indicate if the household charge had been paid in respect of the relevant household.  I understand that the question was added in order to facilitate the local authority&rsquo;s information gathering in respect of collection of the household charge and was not linked to the assessment of grant applications, which will be processed in the normal way.  No moneys have been withheld by any local authority in respect of higher education grants.</p></reply>

The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of housing authorities as an integral part of the housing management functions and there are many different rent schemes in operation across housing authorities.  The decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual housing authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.</p></reply>

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</p><p>- Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</p><p>- Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</p><p>- Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and </p><p>- Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.  </p><p><br />  Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i>: the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development; the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission; the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007; the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act; the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned and,&#8226; where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with. </p><p><br />  This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.  Only households in developments in categories three and four, as identified in October 2011, are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  It is a matter for the relevant local authority to interpret and apply the relevant provisions. </p><p><br />  A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end.  Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.</p><p><br />  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p></reply>

It takes no account, for example, of the fact that while rent levels can be adjusted to reflect changing household income, mortgage repayments cannot.  Nor does it take account of the additional costs taken on when a household becomes a homeowner thereby assuming responsibility for the on-going maintenance of their home. </p><p>  Provisions governing mortgage lending by local authorities are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 and associated credit policy.  Persons in receipt of social welfare payments are not specifically precluded from purchasing their home under any tenant purchase scheme.  However, if the applicants are applying to fund the purchase through loan finance from the local authority they must meet the criteria which apply to such loans. </p><p>  While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment/social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>  In such cases long term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long term nature of the payment is confirmed.  The final decision on whether to grant/refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority.

Officials in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service inform me that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to. It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.</p><p><br />  Section 15 of that Act provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must:</p><p>- be of full age;</p><p>- be of good character;</p><p>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;</p><p>- have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows&#8212;</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font></p><p><br />  In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.

They also maintain more than just a nodding acquaintance with organised criminals in funding themselves and their activities.  Indeed, these paramilitaries are deeply involved in criminal activities. Countering the threat from terrorists has always been a priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and nothing has changed in that regard.  Despite the positive developments there have been in recent years in the North, the Garda&iacute; have never let up in their efforts to counteract these groups. </p><p>  In relation to the incident raised by the Deputy, it must be accepted that the Garda members present, in taking appropriate operational decisions had, above all else, a particular responsibility to ensure the safety of the public in what was a crowded environment.  The possibility that there may have been an effort to provoke the Gardai into taking action with a view to generating public disorder and greater publicity for those involved cannot be discounted.</p><p>  As I said in responses to Parliamentary Questions on this matter last week, the Garda Commissioner has set up a dedicated operation, &ldquo;Operation Ambience&rdquo;.  As a result, over 30 searches were conducted of various locations in Dublin and surrounding counties and a substantial number of arrests were also made.  Three people have been charged with membership of an unlawful organisation under the Offences Against the State Act and Garda inquiries into the matter are ongoing.</p><p>  I am strongly committed to ensure that the Garda&iacute; have the necessary resources they need, not just in terms of manpower and equipment, but also in terms of legislative provisions, to bear down on these paramilitary groups.  I am also committed to making sure that there is seamless cooperation between the security services North and South in dealing with the threat.  That is exactly what is happening.</p></reply>

While good progress continues to be made in reducing the large volume of cases on hand, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process. It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.

It allows tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.</p><p>  Nationals of sixteen countries are currently included in the programme including India, China, Russia, various priority Middle East countries and others.  A review of the Programme was conducted in January this year with a view to submitting to Government a report on its progress and recommendations on extension of the programme in terms of duration and of countries covered. The Government decided on 12 March to extend the Programme for a further period of four years i.e. to end October 2016 in the light, particularly, of the positive response from tourism agencies and operators. </p><p>  The Programme as it operates at present does not for technical reasons allow for reciprocity between the UK and Ireland. This is primarily due to the UK requirement that all visa applicants supply fingerprint (biometrics) data electronically as an essential element of applying for a UK visa. Quite obviously Ireland does not have the capacity to capture such data for all visa applications worldwide; currently for UK visas this is done in over 150 countries.</p><p>  However, in tandem with the Visa Waiver Programme, work is ongoing, through the regular Common Travel Area Forum meetings between INIS and the UK Home Office, on the development of a short stay Common Travel Area visa which would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA and to travel freely between Ireland and the UK. </p><p>  A number of legal and logistical issues are being addressed including the requirement for biometric data capture.  It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors and a trial period will be used to gauge likely demand. Such a visa will supersede the Visa Waiver Programme.</p></reply>

This means, among other things, reducing expenditure on public service pay, whether by reducing headcount or otherwise.  This is particularly so in those public service bodies where pay forms an especially large part of overall expenditure, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where 90% of expenditure is on pay and pensions. </p><p>  The current and projected Garda budgets will necessitate a significant reduction in Garda expenditure. This will undoubtedly require further reductions in Garda numbers. This has been well known for some time, dating right back to when the last Government was in office and the question of exact level of the reductions required will depend on the potential for alternative savings which could mitigate the scale of the reduction in head count required.

Arising from the refusal of their respective asylum applications, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned and his family were notified, by  letters, that the then Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.

In addition, they were notified of their respective entitlements to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  The persons concerned submitted applications for Subsidiary Protection.  When consideration of these applications has been completed, the persons concerned will be notified in writing of the outcomes.

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and it took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law.  In England and Wales, complaints about high hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003.  This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high.  Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012.  Helpful information notes for hedge owners, complainants and local authorities have been published on the web site of Northern Ireland's Department of the Environment.</p><p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in England, Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts as a last resort.  This is designed to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation and the risk that court proceedings would leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department.  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.  In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person would have to show that an easement existed - an easement of light or otherwise - and that there had been a substantial interference with that right.  It is my intention to bring forward a Mediation Bill later this year to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes.  The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.</p></reply>

Short of removal from office following such an impeachment process, which has never been used to date, there are currently no provisions which permit a member of the judiciary to be &quot;disciplined&quot; as envisaged in the Deputy's question.  The Deputy will be aware that the Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to establish a Judicial Council to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges.  This commitment is being given expression in the form of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill aims to provide a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.  In November 2011, the Chief Justice announced that the Judiciary had agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill, a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010.  This sub-committee has provided observations which are the subject of ongoing consideration and consultation, taking account of intervening developments and current Government policy.  This continuing work will inform the framing and drafting of the new Bill, in conjunction with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General.  I intend to publish the Bill in the course of 2013.</p></reply>

It is not an automatic facility open to all persons on whom fines are imposed.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce attachment of earnings to collect unpaid fines.  It is my view, having reviewed how the fine payment and recovery system will work after the introduction of attachment of earnings, that the system set out in the Fines Act needs considerable amendment on a number of fronts.  To that end, I am finalising proposals for the approval of Government, which are aimed, on the one hand, at making it easier for people to pay fines and on the other, at making the recovery of fines more efficient and effective.  I hope to be in a position to publish these proposals in the coming weeks with a view to having them enacted and operational by the middle of 2013.</p></reply>

The document was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which has been asked to report back to me by the end of November. The public submissions referred to by the Deputy were sought by the committee following its receipt of the discussion document and will be examined, in the first instance, by the committee.  The committee's report will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.</p><p>For further background, I am appending the text of my statement of 22 June last when publishing the discussion document.</p><p><table><tr><td><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Shatter Announces Publication of Discussion Document on the Future Direction of Legislation on Prostitution<br /><br />The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence today published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution. Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<br /><br />&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.<br /><br />There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot; <br /><br />The Minister added that: &quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.<br /><br />My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue. <br /><br />This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course. <br /><br />I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot; <br /><br />The discussion document is attached below and will be made available on the Department&#8217;s website,  <br />This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection. The arguments contained in the document are not exhaustive and the questions posed are not intended to limit in any way the range of questions readers might want to consider.<br />22 June, 2012</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Any possible implication for the operation of the Common Travel Area would also have to be very carefully considered.</p><p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.</p><p>  The circumstances of individual cases can vary considerably and it is logical that the outcomes will not always be the same.  At one end of the spectrum are those whose illegal status is genuinely through no fault of their own while at the other can be found a flagrant disregard of the laws of the Irish State and an unwillingness to accept that those laws, under which tens of thousands of lawful migrants have made Ireland their home, must also apply to them.  It is open to persons in an undocumented situation to present their case on its merits and to have it considered.    </p></reply>

Arising from the consultation process, Minister McCausland has recently announced that while he proposes to proceed with the prohibition on fixed price promotions in premises with on licences, he has decided not to proceed with restrictions on bulk purchases from off licences following concerns raised by the Northern Ireland Assembly's Social Development Committee.</p><p>  In light of the approach being adopted in Northern Ireland, I am now considering how best to proceed with regulations under section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008. In this context, I am of course conscious that the effectiveness of any future restrictions in this jurisdiction could be undermined by the lack of any corresponding measures in Northern Ireland. </p></reply>

Accordingly, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces.  In July of this year, I accepted the proposals submitted jointly by the Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff which recommended a re-organisation of Defence Forces units based on a two Brigade structure.

This management regime has been very successful in reducing lice infestation levels nationally.  Treatment triggers during the spring period are set close to zero in the range of from 0.3 to 0.5 egg bearing females per fish and are also informed by the numbers of mobile lice on the fish.  Where numbers of mobile lice are high, treatments are required even in the absence of egg bearing females.  The mechanism for requiring treatments is to issue a notice to treat where appropriate.</p><p>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the lice levels on the 11th of April were 0.47 ovigerous females and a total mobile count of 2.25 lice per fish.  This is within the range where a notice to treat can be issued.  A treatment regime was in place and no notice to treat was required.  At the subsequent inspection on the 30th   of April lice levels had reduced to 0.27 ovigerous females and a total mobile count of 1.16 respectively.  These are well below any treatment trigger levels and reflect the efficacy of the treatment undertaken by the company.</p><p>  As a general point, the sea lice controls operated by the Marine Institute, on behalf of the State are more advanced than those operating in other jurisdictions and are regarded by the E.U. Commission as representing best practice internationally.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-25a.829.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092500075#WRV00500"><p>Research carried out in Ireland indicates that, up to 2008, using a detailed post mortem and histological examination, 35-50% of badgers in high cattle TB prevalence areas were infected with TB compared with an infection rate of 14.9% in areas of low cattle TB prevalence areas thereby substantiating the link between the presence of TB in cattle and in badgers. However, more recent research has shown that the percentage of badgers now infected with TB in previously high cattle prevalence areas has halved since then. The reduction in the incidence of TB in badgers is welcome and indicates an improvement in the health of the badger population. It is to be hoped this will also have knock on benefits for any future badger vaccination programme.</p><p>With regard to the impact of TB in badgers for TB in cattle, a research paper published in 2010 summarises the evidence on the role of badgers in the spread of TB in cattle both in Ireland and the UK and concludes that &#8220;badgers are directly implicated in the transmission of infection to cattle&#8221; and &#8220;the ability to eradicate tuberculosis is severely constrained while infection continues to be spread from badgers&#8221; (<i>Mycobacterium bovis Infection in the Eurasian Badger (Meles Meles): the Disease, Pathogenesis, Epidemiology and Control</i> (Science Direct)  <i>). </i></p><p><br />  There is considerable evidence that the removal of badgers results in a reduction in the incidence of the disease in cattle.  In summary, the first major research project into the impact of badgers on TB incidence in cattle in East Offaly found that the risk of herd breakdowns was found to be 14 times higher in the control area compared with the area from which the badgers were removed.  A later study, the Four Area Project, involved the intensive and proactive removal of badgers in four &#8220;removal&#8221; areas and &#8220;reactive&#8221; culling of badgers in matched reference areas. The published results of this project also demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in TB levels in cattle following the removal of badgers. In view of this research and in order to limit the spread of TB from badgers to cattle, the Bovine TB eradication programme implemented by my Department contains a wildlife strategy involving the removal of badgers by culling when an epidemiological investigation associates a TB herd breakdown with the presence of badgers. This strategy is an important element of Ireland&#8217;s bovine TB eradication programme and has contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the cattle population in recent years.  TB reactor numbers were 18,500 in 2011, the lowest recorded number in any year since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s.</p><p><br />  My Department is satisfied that the badger culling strategy has contributed to a reduction in the incidence of TB over the past number of years. However, it is my intention to replace badger culling with vaccination when research demonstrates that this is a practicable proposition.  There are trials ongoing at present to determine if vaccination of badgers can provide an effective alternative to badger culling in the longer-term and to develop an efficient and effective vaccine delivery methodology.</p></reply>

In order to assist meeting the ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, new taxation measures were introduced in last year&#8217;s budget aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers. Two measures are of particular note in this regard;</p><p><br />  1.Reduced stamp duty rate applying to farm transfers</p><p><br />  2.Restructuring of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) retirement relief</p><p>1. <b>Reduced stamp duty rate applying to farm transfers</b></p><p><br />  There was a reduction in the stamp duty rate applying to the sale on agricultural land from 6% to 2%. In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.</p><p>2. <b>Restructuring of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) retirement relief</b></p><p><br />  Budget 2012 restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. As of 1st January 2014, for those farmers aged 66 and over, an upper limit of &#8364;3m will be introduced on family transfers, compared to an unlimited amount currently. On non-family transfers, the current upper limit of &#8364;750,000 will be reduced to &#8364;500,000. Applying the new limits from 1st January 2014 allows farmers already aged 66 and over to plan the orderly transfer of assets in advance of that date.</p><p><br />  It is important to remember that these new measures do not mean that a farmer has to cease farming altogether beyond the age of 66, but it allows them to plan for a phased gradual transfer of assets to the next generation.</p><p><br />  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &#8364;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.</p></reply>

The Regulation also adopts rules on compulsory labelling where the origin or place of provenance of a food is given and where it is not the same as its primary ingredient.  Insofar as meat as an ingredient is concerned, these rules are subject to the adoption of implementing acts, which must themselves take account of an impact assessment to be carried out by the Commission and reported to the European Parliament and the Council no later than 13<sup></sup>  December 2013.

Prices have continued to increase during 2012 and are currently at record levels, some 12.53% ahead year on year, or 18c per kilo higher. The industry faces a number of challenges in the short and medium term and my Department will continue to assist the sector to resolve these issues.</p><p>  New EU Animal Welfare rules set down new standards in relation to the housing of sows and will come into force on 1 January 2013. A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules.</p><p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department is aware of the scale of the challenge facing pig farmers in respect of the new requirements. To this end, the Department introduced a Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for Sow Welfare in June 2010, with a total of &euro;13 million being set aside under this scheme.  It follows two earlier schemes in 2005 and 2007 which made payments of &euro;6.36 million to 64 applicants.</p><p>  Following discussions with producers and the evidence of the initial stages of the scheme my Department modified and improved some elements of the scheme. Grant-aid is now available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of &euro;500,000 for the first sow house, with further amounts of &euro;300,000 for each of the next three houses.  Applications from 47 producers with a value in grant terms of &euro;4 million were received prior to the enhancement of the scheme.  Since the revised scheme was launched a further 37 applications have been received with a grant value of &euro;7.1 million. This latter number includes a small number of the initial 47 which were withdrawn and resubmitted under the more favourable terms. The penultimate tranche closed yesterday with a final closing date for applications of 31 October 2012.</p><p>  I, together with officials from my Department met with the IFA during the summer to discuss a number of issues including the new animal welfare measures. My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders with a view to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the requirements by the January 2013 deadline.  My Department is in regular contact with banking representatives and has encouraged them to discuss requirements with sectoral agri-food interests. It is of course important that those seeking credit present a suitable business case with detailed cash flow projections. In this context the Department also facilitated contacts between Teagasc and the Banking sector to encourage seminars and training in relation to credit application.  Any farming enterprises that feel they have not been treated fairly in relation to access to credit can contact the Credit Review Office, who will review their case.</p><p>  Improving access to credit is a priority on the business agenda and is an issue which the Government is addressing in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner.  To address the issue the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will shortly launch both the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme and a Microenterprise Loan Fund for small business. While primary production in agriculture, horticulture and fisheries are excluded from the scope of the Credit Guarantee Scheme in the light of particular restrictions under the De Minimis State Aid rules, these enterprises may be eligible under the Microenterprise Loan Fund provisions.</p><p>  I am also working to improve access for Irish pigmeat to 3rd Country markets, and indeed in 2011, exports of Irish pigmeat to international (non-EU) markets increased by 25% to 43,000 tonnes.  I can assure you that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 Report.</p></reply>

I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers are finding it difficult to get credit due to the strict assessments introduced as a result of the global financial crisis.  The banks do provide information online, via the Irish Banking Federation, as to the type of information that they require when making a decision on a loan request in the agriculture sector, however, farmers who are not satisfied with the service provided by their banks can ask for an internal review by the relevant bank and if they are still not satisfied can apply to the credit review office to have their case reviewed.  Despite concerns, a relatively small number of cases from the Agri-Food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.</p><p>  Over the last year some of the banks have been involved in organising information sessions and conferences to explain the credit facilities available in the sector and just this month one of the pillar banks announced its intention to expand its lending activity in the agri-sector.  Nonetheless, I will continue to meet with relevant parties, including the Irish Banking Federation, on a regular basis to discuss all credit-related issues.</p></reply>

In addition, quality has also been negatively affected.  There are significant problems with blight in this year&rsquo;s crops due to high disease pressure coupled with grower&rsquo;s inability to spray at the appropriate times during the severe wet weather.  In many cases harvested potatoes are also showing signs of rot and other wet weather conditions.  Increased production costs associated with the poor weather and rising input costs for growers will have to be carried by a significantly lower marketable yield.</p><p>  These poor yields are being offset somewhat by higher prices. In addition, improved weather has provided good harvesting opportunities over recent days.  Unfortunately, the EU Commission does not provide funding to compensate for losses that arise due to this type of adverse weather conditions.  My Department and other State agencies will continue to work with potato growers and the industry to ensure the long-term viability of the sector.</p></reply>

In developing the EU2020 strategy for recovery and growth in Europe, Heads of State and Government in the European Council recognised this contribution concluding that &ldquo;a sustainable, productive and competitive agricultural sector will make an important contribution to the new strategy, considering the growth and employment potential of rural areas while ensuring fair competition&rdquo;.</p><p>  The three key principles underpinning the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are to preserve food production potential in the EU, to ensure sustainable management of natural resources and to maintain viable rural areas.  In those circumstances, I am satisfied that there is good support to ensure the viability and future development of the food industry throughout Europe.</p><p>  My own view is that food security in the European Union is the essence of what the new Common Agricultural Policy is about. Growing populations and increasing demand for protein-based foods, which is what we predominantly produce in Ireland through the dairy and meat industries, present a significant opportunity not only to continue, as the EU has been, to promote a sustainable way of producing food from an environmental and climate point of view but also to produce greater volumes of food.  I will continue to make the case for sustainable intensification of food production, which is what agriculture should be all about.</p><p>  As to the WTO Doha Development Round, talks are stalled at present and the prospects for conclusion of an agreement are uncertain at this point in time.  Nevertheless, I will continue to maintain pressure to secure an acceptable outcome from these negotiations that does not undermine the development of European and Irish agriculture.</p></reply>

The current CFP is under review and is now expected to be adopted in 2013 possibly during the Irish Presidency. </p><p>  My overarching goal for the new CFP is for a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver a sustainable and eco centred fisheries landscape for future generations.</p><p>  In the current economic climate, we need a policy that both simplifies and reduces the administrative burden while at the same time strengthens and supports the industry&rsquo;s capacity to maximise employment in coastal community&rsquo;s dependant on fishing.  </p><p>  In particular, I will be pursuing initiatives that will deliver and sustain jobs in coastal communities rather than those that promote the concentration of wealth and delivery of excessive profits for a few big international businesses. I support a system which maintains strong economic links between national quotas and the traditional fishing communities which these quotas were allocated to assist.  </p><p>  The Council of Fisheries Ministers under the Danish Presidency reached a general approach on the Basic CFP Regulation and the Common Organisation of the Markets at the June Fisheries Council (12 June). This is a significant, though informal, step in the process of working towards final agreement with the European Parliament under the ordinary legislative procedure. </p><p>  The new CFP will have to be agreed by the European Parliament and Council for adoption under the ordinary legislative process (co-decision).   </p><p>  The intention of a general approach is its message for stakeholders and to the European Parliament as to the direction in which the Council feels the reform of the CFP should go. The Parliament&rsquo;s first reading is expected to be voted on in January.   The negotiations between the Council, the Parliament and the Commission on agreeing a new Regulation are expected to take place during the first half of 2013, during the Irish Presidency. </p><p>  I will continue to work with the Commission and my European colleagues to deliver a new fisheries policy that will underpin the economic and social integrity of our coastal communities dependent on the wider seafood sector.</p></reply>

However looking specifically at the Irish situation, figures from the Bord Iascaigh Mhara Annual Report for 1971/72 gives the number of both full and part time employed on board fishing boats as being 5,801.   An employment survey from BIM gives the 2010 equivalent figure as being 5,475, a reduction of 326 over the full intervening period.</p><p>  Both Food Harvest 2020 and Action Plan for Jobs 2012 recognise that most of the future growth and employment potential in the seafood sector is in the areas of processing and aquaculture.  Food Harvest 2020 aims to increase employment in the seafood sector as a whole, from 11,000 to 14,000 by 2020 and to increase revenue from &euro;700 million to &euro;1 billion by 2020.     In May of this year I announced &euro;3.2 million in grants to 21 seafood processing companies to support investments worth &euro;15.5 million in 2012.  These investments are projected to generate over 142 additional jobs and increased sales of value added seafood products of nearly &euro;44 million by 2015.  These plans add to investment worth &euro;7 million by 21 companies in 2011 and further investment worth &euro;2.7 by 8 companies in 2010.

In the context of internal market and third country trade, DG Agriculture &amp; Rural Development produces regular market forecasts for various agricultural sectors and its most recent short-term outlook for the meat and certain other sectors was published in June 2012. </p><p><b>Dairy sector</b></p><p><br />  The June report predicted increased EU production and exports for most dairy commodities but it is important to note how quickly the market can change. Extreme weather in different parts of the world this summer has had a significant impact on global dairy markets, as rising grain prices have led to an increase in dairy commodity prices.   </p><p><br />  Volatility in dairy prices is caused by imbalances of supply and demand in international markets, which are cyclical in nature.  However, while there will always be short term fluctuations in dairy prices, the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  Growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  Against that background, I believe that prospects and opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years.  My Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.  </p><p><b>Beef Sector</b></p><p><br />  According to its analysis of the overall beef trade, the Commission expects that weak domestic demand and exchange rate movements will cause EU imports to fall by almost 6% in 2012 followed by a stabilisation in 2013. EU beef exports will be affected by a significantly reduced export capacity in 2012 and 2013 because of a shortage in domestic supply. As a result, the EU will revert to a being net beef importer in volume terms in 2012 and 2013 after the exceptional trade surplus recorded in 2011.</p><p><br />  The EU cattle population, which was estimated at 86 million head in December 2011, has declined at an average rate of 1.1% since 2008 and this trend should persist in the near future. EU beef and veal production in 2012 is expected to decrease by 3.5% compared to 2011 and to remain largely unchanged in 2013. A consequence of these supply constraints is that EU beef prices are likely to remain at record levels for the remainder of 2012. High beef prices combined with weak internal demand will lead to a reduction in beef and veal consumption in 2012 before stabilising at the lower level in 2013.</p><p><br />  Ireland is over 600% self sufficient in beef production and exports around 93% of slaughter output with volumes averaging approximately 0.5 million tonnes annually over the past 3 years. The outlook is for continued buoyant cattle prices on the basis that total prime cattle throughput at Department-approved meat plants is down 16% for the year to date compared to the same period in 2011. However, data on calf birth registrations in 2011 and 2012 indicates that prospects for production growth in the beef sector in 2013 are positive. Increased supply availability can be expected to result in increased beef output and exports in the short run. </p><p><b>Lamb sector</b></p><p><br />  According to the latest forecasts from the European Commission, the European sheep flock is expected to remain relatively stable in 2012 with slaughterings also at similar levels to last year. There are uncertainties about consumption levels due to the economic situation.</p><p><br />  Regarding the sheep sector in Ireland, slaughterings for the year 2012 up to week ending 16 September are up by 7% on the corresponding period in 2011. This points to an increase in production following the recovery in the breeding flock which was noted in 2010 and 2011. Factory prices for the year 2012 to date are approximately 2% below 2011 levels for the corresponding period. This reflects the competitive pressures in the market.</p><p><br />  The vast majority of Irish sheepmeat is sold on EU markets, with France being the single most important export market. Although almost all Irish sheepmeat has traditionally been sold on European markets, there has been more interest shown by exporters in third country markets in recent years. My Department, in co-operation with Bord Bia and with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been active in negotiating access to key third country markets. In recent years we have succeeded in gaining access for Irish sheepmeat to Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa and Singapore and we are continuing to work on other possibilities. I am confident that this work will give the sector the options it needs to ensure the best returns possible going forward.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Adoption Act, 2010, is to improve standards in both domestic and intercountry adoption and its enactment coincided with the establishment of the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI). The Adoption Authority of Ireland is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act, 2010. The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy. It has a quasi-judicial role and is independent in its decision-making functions.The AAI is the Central Authority with responsibility for overseeing standards in respect of the adoption process taking place within this jurisdiction.   </p><p><br />  In considering matters relating to intercountry adoption the Authority must satisfy itself that the adoption complies with the terms and conditions of the 1993 Hague Convention, which is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  This applies to all children in the inter country adoption process, including those with special needs.</p><p><br />  The Adoption Act, 2010, which provides the legislative framework for adoption in Ireland, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that <b>all </b>  adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child and to the highest possible standard.  The phrase &#8216;in the best interests of the child&#8217; is absolutely key in this regard. It must not be forgotten that intercountry adoption is a service for those children who cannot be raised by their birth parents or cared for in their own country. The interests of the child must always be paramount throughout the adoption process. This is best achieved through the full implementation of the highest national and international standards governing adoption practice. This is the primary concern for the Adoption Authority of Ireland in conducting its business as it relates to intercountry adoption.</p></reply>

However, consideration of the policy issues in relation to all aspects of the proposed Bill is ongoing. It is intended that non-identifying information could be provided to an adopted person over 18 or to a birth parent. Non-identifying information is information by which another party could not reasonably be expected to be identified and could, for example, include the  forename, religion, approximate age, occupation, birth details, interests, hobbies, educational history, family history and medical history.

The special allocation of &#8364;35m for mental health which was announced in Budget 2012 in line with the Programme for Government commitments will be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children&#8217;s mental health services, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention.</p><p><br />  Of the 414 posts approved to implement the &#8364;35 million package of special measures for mental health introduced in Budget 2012, 353 are with the National Recruitment Service of the HSE at various stages in the recruitment process, 321 have been put to candidates to express an interest and others are awaiting competitions or the completion of essential paperwork.  Most start dates are expected to be in December to allow for the process of checking references, Garda clearance etc.   </p><p><br />  This Government remains committed to engaging these professionals as soon as is feasible and the work of completing the process remains a priority.  These posts will not generate a full year cost in 2012.  However, overall expenditure in mental health for 2012 is not available yet but the provisional outturn to mid-year was, like many other areas, running ahead of budget.  It is not possible at this stage to say what the net end year position will be in mental health.</p></reply>

The HSE and IMB have been advised that there is sufficient availability of the product to meet the needs of patients within the State. </p><p>  In order to ensure that stocks of this product are continuously maintained, it has been necessary for the principal wholesaler to introduce measures to manage the supply of this product to other wholesalers and pharmacies.  These measures have been necessary to address the depletion of stocks on the Irish market for Irish patients because of export of the product from Ireland to other EU markets. is known as parallel distribution and is permitted under EU law. Parallel export has the potential to result in product shortages on the Irish market.</p><p>  The measures introduced by the principal wholesaler to maintain a necessary stock of this product on the Irish market include limitations on the quantity of the product that can be ordered, in one transaction, by other wholesalers.  The allocations from the principal wholesaler have been determined based on historical demand and, therefore should reflect current patient needs. There have been a small number of temporary shortages which have been quickly resolved.  The HSE and the IMB will keep the situation under review.</p><p>  My Department has been engaging with the IMB, the HSE and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) to identify ways in which the Irish system can manage medicines shortages as effectively as possible in order to minimise the impact on patients.  The IMB and HSE work closely with each other to operationally manage medicines shortages when they arise.  The PSI has recently published guidance to registered pharmacists on managing medicines shortages. International efforts to effectively manage medicines shortages are also being considered.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012 was published last July.  The Bill provides for the abolition of the Board of the HSE under the Health Act 2004 and the putting in place of a new governance structure.  The Board will be replaced by a Directorate, headed by a Director General and with strengthened accountability arrangements for the HSE.  The Bill is scheduled to being second stage in the Seanad on Wednesday 26 September.</p><p>  In tandem with the proposed new governance structures, new administrative structures will be put in place in the HSE, to reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.  These new governance and administrative arrangements represent important first steps in the process of delivering the reform agenda contained in the Programme for Government.  The next steps, which will include measures to facilitate clearer and better integrated delivery and funding arrangements, are under consideration at present.</p></reply>

These dealt with a range of matters, including measures to ensure that the relevant parts of the Health Sectoral Agreement within the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 can be given effect.  These discussions were also attended by officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and concluded on  17 September 2012.</p><p>  The outcome of this engagement is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties.  Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are that:</p><p>- Consultants will be available for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present;</p><p>- There can be rostering of consultants where required on 16/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24/7 basis in services where this is required;</p><p>- Clinical Directors will have a strengthened management role in respect of consultants;</p><p>- There will be cooperation with a range of measures to support improved Community and Mental Health services;</p><p>- Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers;</p><p>- There will be more cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.  </p><p>  Separately, Government will apply a 30% reduction in salary for future consultant appointees.  Management proposals to reduce the &quot;rest day&quot; arrangements that currently apply and the elimination of the fee to consultant psychiatrists for giving a second opinion under the Mental Health Act 2001 will be referred to the Labour Court, in line with the procedures provided for in the Public Service Agreement.  The issue of &quot;historic rest days&quot; will be referred to the Labour Court in line with normal procedures.</p><p>  Government policy is to increase the number and availability of consultants in the public health service.   This policy is reflected in the 2008 Consultant Contract and the outcome of the recent discussions.  The revised salary levels for new consultants will facilitate the appointment of more consultants, which will directly enhance the care of patients through increased provision of consultant-delivered services.</p></reply>

All relevant implications arising from this proposal will obviously have to be taken into account including, for example, a recent report by the Law Reform Commission entitled <i>Legal Aspects of Professional Home Care,</i> which in itself  is a follow up to its 2009 consultation paper <i>Legal Aspects of Carers. </i></p><p><br />  Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services.  The question of possible changes to legislation, including regulation, inspection and complaints procedures for Home Care services for older people is at present under consideration.  The Department is examining this matter in the overall context of the licensing of Health Care providers.  Legislation is currently being prepared  and various options are being considered,  including the complex legal issues involved, and the need to prioritise legislation across the Social Care area overall.</p><p><br />  It should be noted that statutory regulation or licensing is only one way of improving the safety and quality of services and that other measures have or are being taken to improve Home Support services delivered by, or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This approach is reflected in the HSE Service Plan 2012, and includes a new public <i>Procurement Framework</i> for Home Care services (with quality and screening requirements); new <i>National Quality Guidelines for Home Support Services</i>, and new <i>National Home Help Guidelines</i>.  These various measures, taken together, have been designed to improve relevant aspects of HSE Home Care provision nationally, pending progression of the legislative proposals raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, a number of changes have been made to the way in which medical card applications are processed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Any medical card holder undergoing a review, who genuinely engages with that review, will not have their entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on their medical card.  In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of their right to appeal this decision.  Contact details for the appeals office are provided to them.  Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, they retain their medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided.  The Appeals officer notifies the appellant of the final decision in the case.</p><p>  In relation to those persons under the age of 25 years who apply for medical cards, in future being on age related Supplementary Welfare Allowance will not, in itself, prohibit a person from being awarded a medical card or a GP visit card.</p><p>  The HSE has implemented a set of guidelines in relation to the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.  The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness.  Terminally ill patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive has confirmed that 96% of fully completed applications and reviews are now processed within 15 days.</p></reply>

Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anxiety, sleep disturbance and insomnia and are known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms.  Consequently, benzodiazepines are usually recommended for short-term treatment only.   The Irish Medicines Board-approved prescribing information for alprazolam products states that they are only to be used when the symptoms of anxiety are severe.  It is also recommended that treatment with an alprazolam product should be as short as possible and generally not more than 8 to 12 weeks, including a tapering off process.</p><p>  In Ireland, benzodiazepines are prescription-only medicinal products.  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.  The Regulations also make it illegal for prescription medicines to be supplied by mail order.  The definition of mail order includes reference to electronic custom solicitation and order for supply.  This includes ordering prescription medicines through internet sites.  </p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board is aware of illegal supply of alprazolam from internet sites outside Ireland and is working closely with the Revenue's Customs Service officials to detain supplies on entry to Ireland and, where possible, with counterpart agencies in other countries to stop the supply.  </p><p>Furthermore, m y Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to introducing additional controls on certain prescription drugs, including benzodiazepines.  These include the introduction of import and export controls as well as an offence of unauthorised possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na.  My Department is consulting with key stakeholders in relation to the proposed amendments and it is anticipated that new legislation will be introduced by early 2013.</p></reply>

I understand that the RSA intend to ask tenderers for the front office service to offer their own proposals for the capture of photo ID.  The matter of what kind of photo ID is therefore not predetermined.</p><p>  As in any outsourcing process, the RSA must follow public procurement rules.  As a general principle, state agencies are expected to find the most cost-efficient way of doing business in order to deliver maximum value for money for the public.  I do not see in this context that we can require an agency to design a tendering process to suit a particular industry.  However, as I have indicated, nothing has been predetermined in terms of what kind of photo-capture will be involved in the new system.</p></reply>

An element of the proposal involved Fishers consulting with the relevant stakeholders both internal and external.   In order to encourage a frank exchange of views my Department did not participate in the actual discussions but facilitated the proceedings by providing a venue for some of the meetings. Fishers placed a particular emphasis on the confidentiality of this consultative work in preparing the report. In this regard it is imperative that the confidential nature of the background papers relating to this process is respected. In any case my Department does not have the names and addresses of individuals and/or groups associated with this consultation process.</p><p>   It should also be noted that the consultants themselves may also have engaged in discussions with stakeholders by email and telephone.  To assist the consultants the IRCG gave them an indicative list of stakeholders. This is attached for information.</p><p>  There is also a reference to a &ldquo;Fearon Report&rdquo;. This relates to an internal briefing note prepared by a member of the Management Board of the Department. In this case there was no formal external consultation process involved.
