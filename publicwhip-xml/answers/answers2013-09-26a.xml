The budget provision for health has reduced by some &euro;1.5bn on the 2008 provision and, taking into account the need to provide for increases in demand, the underlying reduction in health spend is over &euro;3bn since 2008.  At the half year position, the budget overrun in the HSE was just 1% of budget.</p><p>  The health budget has been reduced by 20% in real terms.  The number of staff within the health service has reduced by 10%.  The population has increased by 8%.  Despite this we are still managing to reform and improve the service.</p><p>  There are a number of measures in place to mitigate deficits including the targeting of significant savings on the cost of drugs and medicines; regulations to reduce fees to doctors and pharmacists; savings under the Haddington Road Agreement, and a focus by HSE senior management on key hospitals where significant deficits are emerging.  Detailed regular reporting,  including comprehensive cash monitoring,  is on-going.  Work is also underway in the HSE to reform the financial management systems.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-26a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013092600036#WRA00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 22 together.</p><p>  Galway and Roscommon Mental Health Services, which operates as one administrative unit, has been resourced to implement <i>A Vision for Change</i>, to modernise the service and give better outcomes for both patients and staff.  Existing resources therefore need to be reshaped, and the priority now is to achieve this in this instance, in line with similar initiatives elsewhere. </p><p>  At present, there are 35 acute psychiatric beds in Galway city, and 22 acute psychiatric beds in both Ballinasloe and Roscommon.  This gives a total of 79 beds, serving a population of around 315,000. <i> A Vision for Change</i>  recommends 50 beds for a catchment population of 300,000.  It is clear therefore, in line with policy and operational norms nationally, that the provision of 22 beds in both Ballinasloe and Roscommon means that the current overall stock of 79 in HSE West is too high in relative terms, allied to a corresponding under-development of community based mental health services.</p><p>  To address this situation, a purpose built 50 bed acute mental health unit will be completed in Galway University Hospital in 2015, to replace the existing smaller unit. This Unit will consist of 35 general adult mental health beds, with the remaining 15 beds relating to psychiatry of later life, eating disorders, and mental health and intellectual disability.  The acute unit in Roscommon will continue to provide 22 general adult mental health beds.</p><p>  The re-organisation of services by HSE West will provide a total of 57 general adult mental health beds.  This will be a sufficient number of acute psychiatric beds, in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i>, while allowing the Executive to enhance much needed community based services through re-deployment of some staff from acute services.  It is intended that staff from St. Brigid's, Ballinasloe will be redeployed on a phased basis, to both community mental health teams locally and to the acute units in Galway and Roscommon.  I wish to stress that this initiative will not give rise to any job losses, and there will be no negative impact for the existing patients in Ballinasloe. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the approach adopted by the HSE in this matter is in line with the requirements to deliver <i>A Vision for Change</i>  in the Galway/Roscommon area, and is fully consistent with similiar initiatives taken elsewhere in the country to modernise our mental health services.  This includes taking account of all related services and skill mix availability in the region, as well as other relevant criteria such as geographic and transport considerations, to realise the best options available within available resources. </p><p>  I and HSE management recently met with local and union representatives and listened to the concerns of all involved.  As agreed at that meeting, the HSE will continue to engage with all parties around service re-organisation in the Galway/Roscommon area.  I am satisfied that this is the most appropriate approach to ensure the continued implementation of <i>A Vision for Change</i>  in that region.</p></reply>

Despite the substantial reductions in financial and staff resources which have been necessary in recent years, the health budget accounts for approximately &euro;13 billion annually.  In addition, the health service is the subject of an ongoing major programme of reform in line with the Programme for Government.  It is essential therefore that the health service is led by senior managers with the requisite skills and expertise to ensure safe and effective provision of services to the public during a period of major change.   The number of executives in the HSE earning over &euro;100,000 represents a very small proportion of overall staff numbers and the posts occupied by these staff are necessary for the safe and effective functioning of the the service. </p><p>  In 2012, 121 HSE executives earned in excess of &euro;100,000 and between them, total remuneration, including allowances and arrears, amounted to &euro;14.6m.  A high-level analysis of annualised payroll data from May 2013 indicates that at that time the number of executives on annual remuneration in excess of &euro;100,000 was 129.  In the short time available, it has not been possible to provide the detailed information requested by the Deputy; however the HSE has been asked to provide this information directly to him.</p></reply>

Beaumont Hospital carried out ninety cochlear implants in 2012 (42 children and 48 adults). </p><p>  The HSE has developed a proposal, in liaison with Beaumont Hospital, to introduce a bilateral cochlear implant programme in Ireland.  It is planned that the programme will be located in Beaumont Hospital. This is a complex development and the HSE has engaged with many stakeholders in the proposal development. </p><p>  The programme will involve additional staff, equipment and capital works and will be dependent on additional funding being made available to support its commencement.  The proposal is being considered as part of the 2014 estimates process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-26a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013092600036#WRA01400"><p>Improving access for patients to inpatient and daycase treatment is a priority for this Government and significant progress was made in 2012 towards maximum waiting time targets.  However, 2013 has been very challenging.  While waiting list numbers tend to increase in the first few months of any year, the increase in 2013 was much greater than expected, associated with the unusual wintry conditions and increase in emergency admissions.</p><p>  Hence, the SDU / HSE have put in place a National Intervention Strategy aimed at meeting this year's maximum waiting time targets (eight months for adults awaiting an inpatient or daycase procedure, 20 weeks for children, 13 weeks for anyone awaiting a routine GI endoscopy and 12 months for a first-time outpatient appointment).  They have advised that all hospitals have now developed and commenced necessary action plans to achieve the national targets for maximum waiting times this year.  It is welcome that the latest available figures show a 2% reduction in the overall number of patients waiting for an inpatient or daycase procedure in August compared with July and a 6% reduction in the number of patients waiting longer than 12 months. </p></reply>

This is to deliver a clinical information and service delivery management system, encompassing an electronic service user mental health record.  An allocation of &euro;405,275 from the additional &euro;35 million provided for mental health in 2013 was identified for this purpose. </p><p>  Significant work has been undertaken recently to consult with a range of health professionals and clinicians, together with service user representatives, across mental health services to clarify the requirements for such a system.  It is expected that this consultation will be concluded within the next 6-8 weeks.</p><p>  A Project Structure for the National Mental Health ICT Project has been agreed and work is in train to establish each of the elements as soon as possible.  A Steering Group has been identified to progress the Project and will be advised by a Stakeholder Group, to be chaired initially by the National Director of Mental Health Services.  The components of the Project will be managed by a full-time Project Manager who will work with a Project Team, and arrangements for the identification and release of the Project Team are progressing.</p><p>  The HSE expects to make a decision by the end of the year on the feasibility of extending and developing existing systems or whether there will be a need to tender for a new system.  Thereafter, full national implementation of a mental health Information Systems is a three to five-year process.</p></reply>

Current estimates suggest that there are approximately 450,000 people with doctor-diagnosed asthma in Ireland.</p><p>  The initial focus of the work of the Programme has been primarily on three main areas:</p><p>  1. The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and in relation to this, national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals;</p><p>  2. The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through development of a national model of care; and </p><p>  3. A national project of auditing acute asthma deaths.</p><p>  Work in relation to Asthma Guidelines has included:</p><p>  Acute adult asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have been developed for use in all care settings (primary and secondary care levels), in conjunction with other relevant programmes and the Irish College of General Practice (ICGP).  These include:</p><p>  An in-hospital practical asthma education programme for nurses to underpin and support the implementation of the acute adult guidelines; and</p><p>  General management asthma guidelines for use in all health care settings especially in primary care.</p><p>  The Acute Adult Emergency Guidelines are available through the HSE website.  This user friendly resource will facilitate all health care staff in optimising the management of adult patients attending services with an acute asthmatic episode.</p><p>  Guidelines for acute paediatric asthma have also been completed and should be available soon on the HSE website.  An associated educational programme is being developed at present.</p><p>  The National Asthma Programme is developing a National Model of Care (MOC) for Asthma with an implementation plan which will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances; and to collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  As 85 per cent of asthma is managed in primary care without the need for hospital specialist services, the Programme is aiming to provide at primary care level a yearly programme of assessment for asthma called Chronic Disease Watch (CDW) - Asthma, also known as Asthma Check.  Asthma Check, which has been submitted to the ICGP for review, outlines the step-by-step process for the implementation of guideline based asthma management in primary care to deliver optimal outcomes for patients.</p><p>  The Model of Care will also focus on:</p><p>  Improving access to hospital based specialist asthma services from primary and secondary care services, through Scheduled / Rapid access asthma services (adult/paediatric), and access to specialist asthma therapies.</p><p>  Improving links through Clinical / Asthma Nurse Specialists within the community services.</p><p>  Developing and implementing a standard referral pathway to asthma services.</p><p>  Developing structured assessment and review protocols throughout the system.</p><p>  Establishing uniform discharge protocols.</p><p>  Facilitating access to accurate asthma diagnostics.</p><p>  Examining solutions to develop and subsequently implement an Asthma database / register linked into all care levels (GP, Community Pharmacist and Hospital).</p><p>  The draft model of care has been circulated for stakeholder consultation.  The National Asthma Programme is aiming to have the Model of Care published by the end of this year.</p><p>  Implementation of the National Clinical Programme for Asthma, which was included in the HSE's 2013 Operational Plan is ongoing and will continue in 2014.</p></reply>

It is a matter for Government to determine policy in this area. There has been no Government decision, at this stage on the details of the roll-out of a universal GP service, such as a proposal for a specific age cohort. When the Government has taken a policy decision in this area, I will engage with all relevant stake-holders, as appropriate, in relation to implementation and administrative arrangements.</p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to health care for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.</p><p>  It has become clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition, as outlined initially in the Programme for Government, is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population.</p><p>  However, the Government is firmly committed to introducing a universal GP service within this term of office. The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the delay in the initial step and the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay.</p><p>  It has been agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  A range of options are under consideration with a view to bringing developed proposals to Government shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-26a.38.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013092600037#WRB01300"><p>The prices of drugs vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT.</p><p>  The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels.</p><p>  A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including</p><p>  significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,</p><p>  a lowering of the drugs bill to the State,</p><p>  timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>  reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.</p><p>  A new agreement has also been reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  From 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which are priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.</p><p>Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.   They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The second and third lists containing groups of esomeprazole and rosuvastatin products were published on 20th and 24th September respectively. Once the IMB has assessed the initial 20 priority products, then a further list of priority products will be identified and assessed by the IMB and the process will continue until all medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.</p><p>  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB a two stage price reduction process gets under way. First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. Atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September. Secondly, the legislation also provides that the HSE may set a reference price for each group of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts.</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. It is expected that the first reference price for atorvastatin products will be implemented by November and, subsequently, reference prices for esomeprazole and rosuvastatin products will be implemented by the HSE in accordance with the timelines set out in the legislation. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p></reply>

Of these, 529 are reported as awaiting discharge to long term nursing care; the discharge of the others may be delayed for a number of reasons, including identification of suitable placements to address complex individual care needs or convalescent care requirements, community assessment of needs, or provision of specific aids by the community to facilitate discharge to home.</p><p>  Whilst it is acknowledged that not all patients affected by delayed discharge are older persons, it is accepted that the majority of such patients are from this cohort. Although nationally ED attendances are down by over 5%, presentations by older persons (65+ yrs) are increasing.  Up to mid-September 2013, the number of older persons admitted to hospital has increased by 17% over the equivalent period in 2012 and a significant number of these patients have co-morbid conditions and complex needs.</p><p>  The HSE has put in place a number of initiatives to address this including increased allocations of Fair Deal approvals, the temporary prioritisation of Fair Deal referrals for patients in acute hospitals, the temporary prioritisation of referrals to long stay facilities from acute hospitals for older persons with complex needs and the improved targeting of appropriate homecare packages for older persons.</p></reply>

HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable patient harm and increased health care costs.</p><p>  Established as an independent statutory body under the Health Act 2007, the Health Information and Quality Authority's (HIQA) mandate extends across the quality and safety of the public, private and voluntary sectors.  Since late 2012 the Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA) has been carrying out a monitoring programme against the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Health care Associated Infections (HCAIs), 41 of which have been completed.   Both I and my Department welcome the publication of HIQA&rsquo;s reports and note the concerns raised in these, and indeed, previous reports about hand hygiene practices particularly among medical staff.  With regard to hand hygiene the findings of the Authority suggest that hand hygiene best practice needs to become more operationally embedded at all levels.</p><p>  Achieving a culture of patient safety in which best practice in hand hygiene is embedded requires actions at all levels.  It is the responsibility of management and clinical leadership to make this a priority and ensure that the correct conditions to allow for the improvements in hand hygiene compliance are in place.</p><p>  It must be emphasised that it is of vital importance that health care workers recognise their personal responsibility to protect patients by maintaining their own good hand hygiene.  It is extremely disappointing to note that despite the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE) initiatives to develop an organisational culture of hand hygiene, a significant number of health care staff, including doctors, are still not adhering to the basic principles of hand washing.</p><p>  I very much support the HSE&rsquo;s ongoing work through its national programme of activity to raise awareness amongst staff, monitor compliance with national standards and to take action to reduce HCAIs in hospitals. A key element of this programme is the HSE&rsquo;s continuing bi-annual hand hygiene audits which occur in both the acute sector and in the long stay area as well.  Additionally, from July of this year it has become mandatory for all staff to receive hand hygiene training as part of staff induction and an education programme every two years is being put in place.  The HSE audits have shown an encouraging improvement in hand hygiene compliance with a most recent figure of 84.3% compliance overall (October 2012).</p><p>  The Director General of the HSE has instructed that all hospitals act immediately on the following:</p><p>  Ensure that a member of the senior management team is responsible for hygiene.  This person must give a report to the facility management team on the facilities performance against the 2006 cleaning manual with a remediation plan and on the facilities performance multimodal hand hygiene plan by the end of 2013.</p><p>  Ensure that there is a hygiene programme in place by the end of 2013 which clearly demonstrates the hospital&rsquo;s commitment to hygiene, specifically focusing on patient care equipment, the patient environment and hand hygiene.  The programme should be based on the WHO multimodal framework.</p><p>  Ensure that 100% staff have received hand hygiene education and training by June 2014.</p><p>  Hospitals are to provide monthly reports on progress to the National Director for Acute Services.  The HSE is also working with the main medical professional bodies to address the issue of doctor attitudes and behaviour around hand hygiene.</p><p>  The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the Department of Health has written to the Chair of the Health and Social Regulatory Forum asking that the Forum consider the matter and submit proposals as to how it might adopt a common approach to raise awareness of hand hygiene in particular and support and reinforce compliance with this very important patient safety issue.  It has also been agreed that the CMO will meet with the Director General of the HSE to discuss the issue of governance in the control and prevention of HCAIs.</p></reply>

This has come about as a result of reconfiguration of services and on-going dialogue between the HSE and Stewarts Care.  I understand that families have confirmed their satisfaction with the services offered.</p><p>  In relation to St Michael's House, under the Health Act 2004, the HSE is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services, including disability services. The HSE either directly provides or contracts disability agencies such as St Michael&rsquo;s House to provide a range of disability services through service level arrangements.</p><p>  St Michael&rsquo;s House received over &euro;70 million in 2012 in funding from the HSE to provide a range of services to approximately 1,660 children and adults with an intellectual disability in over 170 centres in the Greater Dublin Area and Navan Co. Meath.</p><p>  The HSE and St Michael's House work in close collaboration with regard to the funding and delivery of services to people with an intellectual disability. As a voluntary agency, St Michael&rsquo;s house are obliged to work within the resources available to them and in that regard have introduced significant efficiencies over recent years to remain within budget. The HSE has advised that these changes to date have not resulted in service contraction.</p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) sets out measures relating to productivity, cost extraction and reform which together intends to achieve a required pay bill reduction of &euro;150m identified in the HSE Service Plan 2013. The agreement provides a framework and opportunities for managers within the health services, including agencies such as St Michael's House, to reduce their costs associated with agency and overtime and a wide range of other pay costs, particularly through measures such as additional working hours and revised rates in respect of overtime.</p><p>  The HSE has advised the Department of Health that the recent application of additional budget cuts under the HRA has presented a significant challenge to St Michael's House.   A process is now under way between the HSE and St Michael&rsquo;s House to identify the impact of these budget reductions on services.  The Department of Health has received assurances from the HSE that both organisations are committed to working within the terms of the HRA to ensure that services are impacted upon only as a measure of last resort.</p></reply>

This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.</p><p>  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines. They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The second and third lists containing groups of esomeprazole and rosuvastatin products were published on 20th and 24th September respectively. It is expected that the initial list of 20 priority products will have been assessed by the IMB by June 2014. At this point a further list of priority products will be identified and assessed by the IMB and the process will continue until all medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.</p><p>  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB a two stage price reduction process gets underway. First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. Atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September. Secondly, the legislation also provides that the HSE may set a reference price for each group of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts.</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. It is expected that the first reference price for atorvastatin products will be implemented by November and, subsequently, reference prices for esomeprazole and rosuvastatin products will be implemented by the HSE in accordance with the timelines set out in the legislation. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p></reply>

One of the recommendations of the VFM Review is to move towards a model of individualised budgeting, whereby individuals and their families will be given more choice and control over the service and supports they require. Any such model will have to be carefully considered and under-pinned by a resource allocation provision which will take account of peoples' needs and circumstances against a defined resource cap.</p></reply>

While the HSE commission the service of the Wexford women's refuge through a service level agreement, it is the voluntary Board of Management who are legally responsible for any decisions that are made in relation to how the service is delivered.</p><p>  The reduction in service provision in Wexford Women's Refuge was based on a decision taken by the Board of Management to reduce services for 13 weeks.  The decision is based on ensuring the long term sustainability of the service while working within a realistic budget as the Refuge has had a reduction in HSE funding over the past 5 years similar to other organisations.  The plan will enable the refuge to continue to provide outreach and drop in services to the end of December 2013.  While there is a reduction in service provision it is important to note that there is no reduction in funding from the HSE to the service in 2013 other than 2.5% which is in line with other government cuts.  It is within this context that the voluntary Board of Management has been working in partnership with the staff, Trade Unions and funding agencies to devise a plan that will ensure the long term sustainability and delivery of the service to women and children in Wexford.  The voluntary Board of Management is committed to ensuring that there continues to be a Refuge in Wexford.  They are working in partnership with the other relevant bodies to overcome the immediate challenges and are confident that a Refuge service will continue to be available in Wexford once the current difficulties are addressed.  HSE Children and Families Services are committed to supporting the Board in their efforts to develop this plan in partnership with staff, management and the Local Authority.</p><p>  The National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence was published in 2010.  It aims to provide a framework for sustainable intervention to prevent and effectively respond to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and is lead by Cosc which is the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  In relation to Ireland providing only one third of EU recommended places I would like to refer the Deputy to a COSC publication '<i>Domestic and Sexual Violence Services in Ireland: Service Provision and Co-ordination</i>' which states &quot;In 2007, the levels of domestic and sexual violence services in Ireland satisfied the criteria established by the Council of Europe&quot; (Page 68, section 3.7).</p></reply>

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care. Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</p><p>  The Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive to develop an overall plan regarding future public provision of long-stay residential care services. The plan will reflect both national and regional requirements and will have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards, all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.</p><p>  The review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will also influence the future direction of residential care services. This review will consider the long-term sustainability of the Scheme as well as looking at the community based services.  Work on the review is on-going and it is expected that the review will be completed in late 2013 or early 2014. A longer-term plan for public residential facilities is therefore expected to be completed by approximately mid-2014 following completion of the review of the Scheme.</p><p>  The Health Act 2009 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 provide that each nursing home must have a Statement of Purpose. The Statement of Purpose must include details of the range of needs that the designated centre is intended to meet. It would be inappropriate for the Minister for Health to require all private and voluntary nursing homes to provide a minimum number of places for higher dependency patients because the nursing homes may not be able to adequately cater for needs of the residents.</p><p>  Our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity. People should only be entering long-term nursing home when this becomes absolutely necessary. This means that only the most dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care. One of the key priorities identified in the HSE's <i>National Operational Plan 2013</i> is the progression of a single assessment tool for older people. This standardised framework will ensure that there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment nationally. It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible.</p></reply>

Membership includes statutory, professional, parent and voluntary representatives, including the IHF, Lauralynn and The Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation.  The NDC has commenced working in partnership with these providers to develop a model for the provision of Hospice at Home care.</p><p>  In 2012 HSE spent approximately &euro;8.58m on home nursing for children with life-limiting conditions.  It is widely acknowledged that this did not capture all relevant expenditure, which is significantly higher.  It is also acknowledged that children with life-limiting conditions, particularly palliative care needs, are prioritised.  Every effort is made to provide care to the maximum extent possible, including home care for them and their families.</p><p>  The HSE is committed to proper governance, that care provided is clinically sound and that those providing care are adequately trained.  A suitable national programme of continuing professional education has been established in partnership with the HSE, IHF and Crumlin Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  A working group has been established in HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster to restructure the financial system so that relevant expenditure is effectively accounted for.  This will be replicated across all regions.</p><p>  Eight children&rsquo;s Outreach Nurses are in place in throughout the country to facilitate a co-ordinated support structure for children and families.  They will identify the needs of each child and link families to appropriate local services.</p><p>  The first Consultant Paediatrician with a Special Interest in Paediatric Palliative Medicine has been appointed to Crumlin Hospital and is available to provide an advisory service to other paediatric and maternity hospitals.</p></reply>

The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;75 per night subject to a maximum of &euro;750 in any period of 12 consecutive months.

In addition, patients opting to be private to their consultant for the purposes of in-patient services in public hospitals are also liable for the daily private accommodation charges directed by the Minister under Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 (as amended): a maintenance charge and a daily charge.

It is not a question of funding being withdrawn as funding through the formal education route ceases once a person's education comes to an end.  The Department of Education and Skills is responsible for making educational provision for young people with disabilities up to age eighteen.  In relation to young adults over eighteen years of age with special needs the Health Service Executive (HSE) has the lead role for the provision of specialised disability support services.  </p><p>  This year the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4m in demographic funding to help to provide training places and day services for school-leavers and Rehabilitative Training (RT) graduates.  The HSE indicate there are 850 young people this year who are making the transition to HSE services compared to 695 school-leavers who required places last year.  The provision of services to these young people with support needs is extremely challenging in all regions of the country and the HSE and service providers are making every effort to provide day services to people with disabilities over the age of 18 who require continuing supports.  This has always been dependent on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver and the available resources.  Each person is assessed on an individual basis to plan for their services and to identify the most suitable training place or day service placement depending on their particular needs and abilities. </p><p>  Places have now been provided for 831 school-leavers.  Currently 19 school-leavers and 8 RT graduates still require a place and 163 individuals have been provided with a partial placement and require additional hours to fully address their assessed need.  Work is underway in each region to address the needs of those individuals who have not been provided with placements or those placements requiring additional hours.</p><p>  From within the existing disability allocation, resources are being made available by the HSE to enable these remaining places to be provided. The HSE in collaboration with voluntary service providers and umbrella representative groups will put in place the necessary monitoring and oversight arrangements to ensure that these remaining places are in place as speedily as possible.   </p></reply>

The HSE either directly provides or contracts disability agencies such as St. Michael House to provide a range of disability services through service level arrangements.</p><p>  St. Michael&rsquo;s House received over &euro;70 million in 2012 in funding from the HSE to provide a range of services to approximately 1,660 children and adults with an intellectual disability in over 170 centres in the Greater Dublin Area and Navan, Co. Meath.</p><p>  The HSE and St. Michael's House work in close collaboration with regard to the funding and delivery of services to people with an intellectual disability. As a voluntary agency, St. Michael&rsquo;s House are obliged to work within the resources available to them and in that regard have introduced significant efficiencies over recent years to remain within budget. The HSE has advised that these changes to date have not resulted in service contraction.</p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) sets out measures relating to productivity, cost extraction and reform which together intends to achieve a required pay bill reduction of &euro;150m identified in the HSE Service Plan 2013.

A process is now underway between the HSE and St. Michael&rsquo;s House to identify the impact of these budget reductions on services.

The principal actions are in line with the National Strategy.  The HSE&rsquo;s policy states that a health-focused analysis of violence is crucial, not only because the consequences of such violence require a significant amount of healthcare system resources, but most importantly because the health care system is often the first route through which victims seek to access supports.</p><p>  The Children and Family Agency within the forthcoming new Chid and Family Agency Bill (1)(c) has responsibility for providing care and protection for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence whether in the context of the family or otherwise.  Going forward this will ensure that there is an integrated care pathway for identifying, referring and providing a range of supports for families who are experiencing or have experienced domestic violence including referral pathways to services funded by the Children and Family Agency through service level or grant aid agreements.</p></reply>

This has been achieved during a period when the average length of stay in acute hospitals has also reduced and the number of patients receiving the treatment they require without having to stay in hospital (that is day case patients) has increased as a percentage of total discharges by over 50%.  </p><p>  The 2013 Service Plan required the HSE to continue to focus its delivery of services on the dual challenge of protecting patient outcomes while, at the same time, reducing costs. 2014 will be no different in this regard and any measures impacting on the health system as a result of Budget 2014 will also be assessed against these criteria &ndash; with the outcomes of this consideration set out in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2014, which will be submitted to me for approval within a matter of weeks of the Budget. </p><p>  The National Service Plan, in setting out the operating framework for the delivery of HSE services throughout 2014, will look to deliver the maximum level of safe services possible, with prioritisation, where necessary, of certain services to meet the most urgent needs. The Plan will also set out targets in respect of each programme area to ensure that performance can be evaluated throughout the year in order to identify any emerging areas of concern, and, should any such concerns arise, implement necessary remedial measures without delay. </p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons of any age with a specific illness, such as cancer.</p><p>  However, under the legislation, there is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account in determining whether or not &quot;undue hardship&quot; exists for a person in providing a health service for themselves or his or her dependents. </p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. </p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

Last month I announced appointments to this Board to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January 2013. These appointments ensure appropriate professional membership with the necessary capital development expertise and experience in complex healthcare capital projects. Also in August I announced the appointment of members to the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board. This Board will oversee the operational integration of the three existing paediatric hospitals in advance of the move to the new hospital and is also the client for the new hospital, and hence is critically important for the project as a whole. Earlier this month, Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman was selected as CEO of the Children's Hospital Group following an open recruitment process through the Public Appointments Service. </p><p>  With regard to the progress of the capital project, the tender process for the procurement of a new design team is well underway, and the aim is to have the new design team in place by the end of 2013.  Pre-application planning discussions have commenced and the aim is to secure planning permission by December 2014. A review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is almost complete; the number and location of these satellite centres in the Dublin area is a key decision, as the size, activity and infrastructure of these satellite centre(s) has implications for the main hospital brief.   In parallel, St. James's Hospital is working closely with HSE Estates and the National Paediatric Development Board in regard to the decant phase of the project. </p><p>  The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a priority for me and for this Government. I am confident that the appointments made to the two Boards will ensure the new hospital is completed as swiftly as possible, with optimal design and value for money. </p></reply>

They provide a clearly measurable way to track progress in the fight against global poverty.    The Goals are central to Ireland&rsquo;s development programme, and to our renewed policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, which reaffirms our commitment to the fight against poverty and hunger as an integral part of our foreign policy. The T&aacute;naiste and I took part yesterday in a major high level international meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York to review progress on the MDGs as the 2015 target date approaches and discuss the shaping of global development policy for the years ahead.  We believe it is essential that the entire international community strengthens and accelerates its efforts to maximize progress on the remaining targets set by the MDGs by 2015.  Ireland is recognised internationally for the strong lead we have taken in this process, and for the effectiveness of our aid programme, in some of the poorest countries in the world. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s new Policy on International Development also clearly restates our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA) when economic circumstances permit.   Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance, a significant achievement in the context of the very difficult conditions facing the country.  Last year, we provided some &euro;629 million in ODA, representing 0.47% of GNP.  For 2013 we have allocated a total of &euro;622 million to ODA. These represent very significant allocations of public funds and a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people in assisting those less fortunate than ourselves.</p></reply>

Occasionally, consultants or companies with some communications experience are commissioned to provide services such as project management, logistics and event management.  I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on all consultant expenditure and commissioning of such work is in full compliance with national and EU procurement regulations concerning tendering requirements.DHR Communications has been contracted since 2010 to manage and administer the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) grants scheme. This involves managing two funding rounds each year, including through national and regional information workshops; managing and administering the application process; organising the judging process and providing detailed feedback to all applicants; processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records; maintaining and updating the SCMF website and managing the SCMF student competition.  DHR was awarded a two-year contract to 2012 and was re-engaged in February 2012 for a further two years following a competitive tendering process.      Following a competitive tendering process, DHR has been engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin. This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of my Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This work represented a very minor element of the project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.</p><p>Africa Day Family Days, incorporating musical entertainment, cultural activities and an African Bazaar, were hosted by the Department in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010, in CHQ in Georges Dock in 2012 and at the Farmleigh Estate in 2013. In 2011, the Department supported a smaller-scale series of performances, family events, art exhibitions, debates and educational activities instead of hosting a flagship event.</p><p>DHR also provided short-term management support services for the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, including the logistical management of the nationwide public consultation activities.</p><p>The table below sets out fees and third party expenses paid to DHR Communications since 9 March 2011.</p><p>DHR Communications&rsquo; business address is 80 Francis Street, Dublin 8.</p><p><b>Project and Event Management 9 March 2011 to date</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Name of Project/Event</b></th><th><b>2011</b></th><th><b>2012</b></th><th><b>2013</b></th></tr><tr><td>SCMF</td><td>&euro;50,988</td><td>&euro;47,430</td><td>&euro;55,112</td></tr><tr><td>White Paper Review</td><td>&euro;25,000</td><td>&euro;26,026</td><td>nil</td></tr><tr><td>Africa Day</td><td>&euro;6,806</td><td>&euro;90,851</td><td>&euro;102,670</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Performance against profile is reported regularly to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and published by the Department of Finance as part of the Monthly Exchequer Statement. The Monthly Exchequer Statement for August has been published on the website of the Department of Finance. In some areas, expenditure and receipts are evenly distributed throughout the year. In other areas, there are considerable variations that are foreseeable.  The profiles as far as possible take account of known variations.     At the end of August, my Department had spent &euro;418m out of a total net voted allocation for 2013 of &euro;670m.  This represents 62% of the net annual allocation.  It is expected that the year-end out-turn will be close to or within the overall net voted amount.   At the end of August, receipts classed as Appropriations-in-Aid were ahead of profile, largely due to increased passport fee receipts. </p></reply>

With the number of fatalities surpassing 100,000, there are now close to 7 million people who are in need of immediate life saving support. In addition to more than 4 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are in excess of 2 million Syrians who have fled the violence to take refuge in neighbouring countries, one million of whom are children.    In the face of this terrible suffering, it is imperative that the international community is united in demanding greater protection for Syria&rsquo;s civilian population. The world has rarely seen a humanitarian crisis as bad as that caused by the conflict in Syria.</p><p>  Ireland has been unwavering in its support to the international humanitarian response. To date, we have provided almost 11 million Euros to the relief effort and are one of the world&rsquo;s most generous donors &ndash; on a per capita basis - to the response to this crisis. Through trusted NGO partners here in Ireland, as well as the UN and the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, we are playing a considerable part in the international effort to meet the massive needs both inside Syria and in the wider region.</p><p>  My officials are continuously monitoring the evolving situation in Syria and the surrounding region, and my proposed visit to Lebanon next month will provide an opportunity to review the relief effort and assess humanitarian needs on the ground. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland is likely to provide further assistance, within our means, to the humanitarian response.</p></reply>

Firms engaged in the provision of debt management services will now require to be authorised by the Central Bank pursuant to Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 (as amended) (the Act).</p><p>  The Act defines a &ldquo;debt management firm&rdquo; as meaning: &ldquo;a person who for  remuneration provides debt management services to one or more consumers, other than an excepted person&rdquo;.  The Act also defines &ldquo;debt management services&rdquo; as meaning:</p><p>  (a) giving advice about the discharge of debts (in whole or in part), including advice about budgeting in connection with the discharge of debts,</p><p>  (b) negotiating with a person&rsquo;s creditors for the discharge of the person&rsquo;s debts (in whole or in part), or</p><p>  (c) any similar activity associated with the discharge of debts&rdquo;.</p><p>  Firms that provide debt management services may also provide other services and may therefore require to be authorised for several different activities. For example, firms may require to be authorised as money transmission businesses and/or payment institutions, as well as requiring a separate authorisation to provide debt management services, if they make payments on behalf of their clients.</p><p>  The Central Bank issued a consultation paper on 1 August 2013 in respect of the proposed regulatory regime to apply to debt management firms.  The proposals set out a robust set of requirements for what is an important sector, particularly for the clients of debt management firms many of whom struggle to manage their financial commitments and seek advice and assistance from such firms. The consultation paper closed for submissions on 23 September 2013.  The Bank is currently considering the submissions received before finalising the proposed Authorisation Requirements &amp;amp; Standards for Debt Management Firms.</p><p>  The proposals set out requirements in respect of compliance and audit arrangements that seek to ensure an appropriate level of oversight is in place in respect of the services provided by debt management firms to ensure compliance with their regulatory obligations. The Central Bank acknowledges that there is potentially a wide range of entity types that will seek authorisation as debt management firms. The Bank has further advised me that, it proposes to take the nature, scale and complexity of the entity into account when considering applications which will be assessed on a case by case basis. For example, it is not envisaged that a full time compliance officer will be required in every instance. Alternative arrangements put forward by applicants will be considered in this regard.</p></reply>

The 2010 Act does not limit the range of documents or information that a designated person may have reasonable grounds to believe can be relied upon to confirm the identity of the customer.</p><p>  My Department has published Guidelines on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing on the application of the 2010 Act.  These guidelines specify a non-exhaustive range of documentation which the bank may choose to accept for the purposes of verifying identity.  The range of documentation includes utility bills but also many other types of documentation issued by Government Departments, state agencies and financial institutions.  In the event that an individual provides a plausible explanation as to why the suggested documentation cannot be provided, the bank may choose from an additional specified list of methods to assist in confirming the identity of the customer.</p><p>  Ultimately, it is up to each bank to decide, on a risk based approach, whether it accepts other forms of customer identification.  However, there is a clear statement in the draft guidelines to the effect that &quot;<i>where an individual is genuinely not in a position to provide standard evidence of identity it is important that he/she is not prevented from gaining access to the financial system solely due to not being able to produce particular documentation.&quot;</i></p></reply>

However per latest published information for 31 March 2013, which is available on the NAMA website, www.nama.ie, NAMA debtors in aggregate owe close to &euro;70 billion in par debt.   All NAMA staff are employees of the NTMA and are assigned to NAMA by the NTMA.  NAMA advises that, since inception, 59 staff assigned to it by the NTMA have left or are due to leave the Agency to take up employment elsewhere, including 53 who have returned or are returning to the private sector &ndash; 6 have moved to other businesses within NTMA.  Some of those that have left were employed on short term contracts.</p><p>  Under the NTMA business model, all employees are recruited on the basis of individually negotiated contracts.  In addition to NAMA, the NTMA carries out a range of commercial asset and liability functions on behalf of Government and its ability to successfully perform these functions is critically dependent on its ability to attract employees &ndash; often with specialist skills &ndash; from the private sector, including those at middle and senior management level. That is the basis on which close to 300 staff have been recruited to NAMA from the private sector over the past three years and it would not have been possible to move from a standing start in December 2009 to become fully operational with a &euro;32 billion balance sheet a year later without having that ability to recruit the appropriate expertise and experience from the private sector. Mobility with the private sector is a critical component of the NTMA model and it is important that the NTMA&rsquo;s ability to attract employees from the private sector not be disrupted.  In the case of NAMA, employees are recruited on the basis of specified purpose contracts &ndash; their employment lasts for as long as their function is required by NAMA only. </p><p>  There are extensive safeguards in place to protect the confidentiality of information held by NTMA employees, including those assigned to NAMA.    Employees assigned to NAMA by the NTMA, as is the case with all other NTMA staff, are subject to Section 14 of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990 which prohibits an employee from disclosing any information obtained while carrying out their duties as employees of the NTMA. Employees assigned to NAMA are also subject to a prohibition on release of confidential data under Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009.  NTMA employees, including those assigned to NAMA, are subject to the Official Secrets Act.  Contravention of these prohibitions is a criminal offence.  These protections do not cease at the point of resignation but rather apply indefinitely and extend to former employees.</p><p>  The notice period for NTMA employees assigned to NAMA is typically three months.  NTMA contracts for employees assigned to NAMA have a provision entitling the NTMA to place the employee on garden leave at any point during the notice period during the time the employee may not work for another employer.</p><p>  Following a review of its policy in respect of notice periods and post-termination restrictions on employment, which was conducted on the NTMA&rsquo;s behalf (as employer) by the law firm, Matheson, the NTMA is implementing a number of changes to its employment contracts, including the introduction of longer notice periods of 3 to 6 months (up from 1 to 3 months) for middle and senior management employees and garden leave provisions to be included in all new employment contracts.  In addition, a new provision is being added in employment contracts, where relevant, that restricts departing staff from performing services for a new employer, during the first six months following the termination of their employment with the NTMA, relating to a transaction or other matter in respect of which they participated directly or substantially in the course of their employment with the NTMA and were in possession of confidential information as a result.   In respect of NTMA employees assigned to NAMA, this provision has been introduced for all new employees and existing employees as they are promoted. As I pointed out above, the three-month notice period and garden leave provisions already apply to NTMA staff assigned to NAMA.  Finally as I have stated previously I support interaction between the public and private sectors so as to bring fresh thinking and new ideas.</p></reply>

Administrators of AVC funds (including PRSA administrators) are required to provide, within 15 working days of the end of each quarter, commencing with the quarter ending on 30 June 2013, certain statistical information to Revenue in relation to AVC pre-retirement transfers or encashments made during the quarter in question. </p><p>  The information for the first quarter ended 30 June 2013 has been received and the tax yield for that quarter amounted to &euro;10.8 million. It is too early at this stage to comment on the outturn for the year. I have previously stated, however, that this measure enables rather than incentivises individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions. It is also important that individuals continue to save and provide for their retirement and these are likely factors in the scale of the take-up to date. </p></reply>

Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.

The guidelines provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. Direct expenditure in 2012/13 related to the production, design and printing of the guidelines which, in the main, was funded by the National Office of Suicide Prevention (N.O.S.P.) but involved a contribution of &euro;3,740 from my Department's National Education Psychological Service. NEPS Psychologist are also raising awareness of the Guidelines at school level.</p><p>  In addition in the same period I had published, along with my colleague, Minister Fitzgerald, an Action Plan on Bullying which sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools. Officials from my Department have already commenced work on the implementation of the actions. In particular, an awareness raising initiative on cyber bullying targeted at young people is already underway and my Department is supporting the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which took place in March. I have allocated &euro;500,000 to support the implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying. Actual expenditure in respect of 2013 will be known closer to years end. There are no substitution costs involved.</p><p>  My Department's National Behavioural Support Service afforded during 2012/13 post-primary school teachers an opportunity to train in the delivery of the 'Friends for Life' and 'My Friends Youth' programmes which are aimed at reducing anxiety and building resilience among students. For 2012/13 some 193 teachers from 93 schools received training in this regard at a cost of &euro;91,193 (including teacher substitution costs).</p></reply>

Under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students.</p><p>  Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. A framework document was published jointly by the Post Primary Management bodies and the NAPD (National Association of Principals &amp;amp; Deputies) in September, 2012 to provide guidance for school management in the allocation of teaching hours to guidance counselling in post-primary schools in the context of the decision in Budget 2012 to withdraw the provision of ex-quota guidance hours to schools. This should be of assistance to schools in terms of how they maximise guidance provision.</p><p>  My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools). </p><p>  My Department also has existing arrangements in place for providing short-term support to schools that are dealing with particularly acute incidents that arise due to tragic accidents, bereavements etc.  Five schools were supported in this manner in the 2012/13 school year.</p></reply>

This involves the use of the Enforcement Services Unit of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) to have such awards enforced if appropriate through the civil courts. </p><p>  In practice upon receipt of a request, NERA will endeavour to engage with the employer to seek compliance with the relevant determination.  Should the employer refuse to comply with a determination, NERA may initiate legal proceedings, in the Minister&rsquo;s name.  In deciding whether or not to intervene, NERA has regard to the amount of the award, the potential for achieving a favourable outcome for the claimant and the scale of the costs likely to be incurred in doing so.  The enforcement of a Circuit Court order in these circumstances is the responsibility of the relevant County Sheriff and my Department has no capacity to intervene.  </p><p>  Where an employer is legally insolvent (liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy etc.) the employee may be entitled to seek redress, through payment of such an award, from the State under the Insolvency Payments Scheme which is operated by the Department of Social Protection. Specifically, in respect of EAT determinations in cases of Redundancy Appeals, where an employer fails to pay the amount awarded; an employee has recourse to the Social Insurance Fund.  </p><p>  I acknowledge that the system of enforcement of awards that has developed over the years has become complex and in some cases involves very long delays. In this context and in relation to industrial relations and employment rights generally I have initiated a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service. </p><p>  I believe that for a workplace relations system to have credibility it must be supported by proportionate, effective and efficient compliance and enforcement measures. The current system of enforcement of employment rights awards is cumbersome, expensive and not fit for purpose.  For this reason, I am proposing to make provision in the Workplace Relations Bill for a range of enhanced compliance measures, including the use of Compliance Notices, Fixed Charge Notices and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the WRC Adjudicators and Labour Court Determinations.  I am confident that the introduction of these measures will provide for more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law. </p></reply>

This incentive replaced this Department&rsquo;s Employer Job PRSI Incentive Scheme and Revenue&rsquo;s Job Assist Scheme.  Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and creating a full-time position, employers will receive a direct cash incentive over two years if the person they hire has been unemployed for a prolonged period.

Over the same period, applications from 2,125 jobseekers have been received.  Of these, 1,577 applications have been deemed eligible with 1,029 qualifying on the basis of being 24 months unemployed and, therefore, attracting a payment to an employer of &euro;10,000 paid over two years.  The remaining 548 applications are eligible for a payment of &euro;7,500 over two years, having been unemployed for between 12 and 24 months.</p><p>  At present, 400 eligible employers and eligible jobseekers have been matched.  Of these, 250 employment contracts commenced in July and August and grant payments in respect of 236 cases will be made before the end of September.

There are currently over 82,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.  In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and tenant and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and/or recourse to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social or criminal behaviour.  If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if affected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme with a view to introducing a code of conduct for rent supplement eligibility similar to that which operates for local authority tenants.  The purpose of this review is to ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the rent supplement scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants.  The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals, which would also result in these individuals being subject to the local authority vetting procedures. The Department is currently working closely with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in transferring responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from this Department to local authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).

Recipients of the allowance must be in receipt of a qualifying social protection payment immediately prior to the commencement of a course of study.</p><p>  Changes were introduced to the BTEA as a result of measures agreed in the context of the last Budget, the pressure on resources and following the implementation of a number of recommendations arising from the review of employment support schemes, which was published in January 2013 and was followed by a stakeholder consultation.  As a general principle, BTEA will only be considered where a prior entitlement to a social protection payment has been established.  BTEA is not intended as an alternative funding mechanism for the pursuit of full-time education, given that options already exist under the student grant schemes operated and funded by the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p>  The provision that allowed a person on Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) and certain other schemes to transfer directly to BTEA ceased in line with the review findings mentioned above.   A person participating on VTOS must now establish an underlying entitlement to a DSP payment in order to qualify for BTEA.  These changes will ensure that the main source of public income support for persons attending further and higher education are the means-tested student grant schemes. It will also lessen the risk that BTEA may become an alternative funding stream for accessing further and higher education courses involving substantial higher costs for the Exchequer and leading to inequalities for students.</p><p>  The priority for this Department is that BTEA will be focused, targeted and suitable for the needs of the unemployed and the labour market in the future.  In this context it is worth noting that the numbers availing of BTEA and the associated cost of the scheme has risen dramatically in recent years.  Numbers for the current 2012/13 academic year are 25,961 which represents a 191% increase on the 2007/08 numbers.</p></reply>

For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.   </p><p>  In order to qualify for credits, a person must first have entered insurable employment - he or she must have paid at least one PRSI contribution as an employed contributor.  Subsequently, insured workers may be awarded credits if they claim a social welfare payment because they are out of work, or they are ill or incapacitated, or if they are engaged in certain training or educational courses.  If at any stage in their working life, a person has no PRSI paid or credited contributions for two full tax years, they cannot be awarded credits again until they return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks. </p><p>  The PRSI class at which a contributor paid his or her last PRSI contribution while working, determines the type of credits which may be awarded.   Those whose last paid PRSI contribution was at Class A may be awarded Class A credits.  Those who paid PRSI, for example, at Class D (modified rate contributor) may only be awarded Class D credits.</p><p>  Credits do not, on their own, give an individual entitlement to social insurance benefits.  They may, however, may assist insured workers to qualify for various social insurance benefits. While the contribution conditions applying to the various social insurance schemes can vary, a claimant must, in general, have:</p><p>(a) <i>paid</i> a minimum number of weekly contributions (ranging from 52 for short term benefits to 520 in the case of pensions),   <i>and</i></p><p>(b) a certain number of <i>contributions or credits</i>   over a specified period.  In the case of short term benefits the number of contributions or credits relates to the relevant tax year.  In the case of long-term benefits (e.g. pensions) this is on the basis of the yearly average number of contributions and/or credits over the person's working life.</p><p>  Credits cannot be used to satisfy condition (a).  Thus, credits are only of value to a person who satisfies this &quot;paid contribution&quot; test.</p><p>The system of credits and the conditions governing the award of credits have evolved over a number of years.  When the consolidated system of social insurance was set up under the Social Insurance Act 1952, it was based on the principle that once a person became insured under the Act, that individual would be able to maintain their status as an insured person and their entitlements to various benefits of the system.  Since then the system of credits has developed in line with the development of new schemes and payments.  The current legislative provisions governing the award of credits are contained in S.I. No. 312 of 1996.  Further details relating to credits and the conditions applying to the various social insurance schemes can be found on the Department's website .</p><p>  Individuals are not permitted to buy back credits in relation to an earlier period of their working life.  They may, however, be in a position to establish an underlying entitlement to credits for that period of time.   Individuals, who cease to be covered by compulsory social insurance, may opt to protect their existing long-term social insurance pension entitlements by becoming insured on a voluntary basis and paying voluntary ccontributions.   A person who wishes to become a voluntary contributor must satisfy certain contribution conditions and must apply to become a voluntary contributor within 12 months after the end of the contribution year in which he/she was last compulsorily insured.</p></reply>

There are approximately 82,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013. Control is an integral part of the day-to-day administration of the rent supplement scheme. Where a recipient&rsquo;s circumstances change, they must inform the officer dealing with their rent supplement claim who will determine if the change affects their on-going entitlement to the payment.    There are a number of operational controls in place to ensure that payment of rent supplement does not continue to those who no longer have an entitlement such as regular review of claims and warning reports issuing to officers where there is a change in the recipients circumstances which would prompt a review of entitlement. Reviews of claims are generally carried out once to twice yearly, when new information becomes available or more frequently where the risk of overpayment is high. Reviews of rent supplement also involve third party verification by landlords and may include home visits if necessary. In 2012 the Department introduced new powers of enquiry to landlords which allow staff to formally request landlords to provide information in respect of their rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and existence of the tenancy. This measure further improves both the governance and oversight arrangements in place.</p><p>  It is also open to any landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving payment in respect of accommodation where they no longer reside. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs at the address provided, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.</p></reply>

The medical evidence provided by the claimant in support of her claim was examined by a medical assessor who was of the opinion, based on the evidence provided, that the person concerned was not eligible for invalidity pension as she did not satisfy the medical criteria.   The application for invalidity pension was disallowed by a deciding officer.  The person in question was notified of this decision and the reason for it on 14 April 2012. </p><p>  Further medical evidence was subsequently received from the claimant on several separate dates in the period between October 2012 and April 2013 with requests that the decision be reviewed.  This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor who also expressed the opinion that the person concerned does not satisfy the medical criteria. The deciding officer has confirmed the original decision and notified the claimant of the outcome on 12 June 2013, advising her of her right to appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.  </p><p>  The person concerned appealed the decision and submitted further medical evidence with her appeal.  This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor on 5 September who expressed the opinion that the person concerned does not satisfy the medical criteria required for invalidity pension. Accordingly the original decision of the deciding officer remained unchanged and a submission has been sent to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office for determination of the person&rsquo;s concerned entitlement to an invalidity pension.</p></reply>

The scheme provides a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households that are vulnerable to energy poverty. The scheme is primarily delivered through Community Based Organisations (CBO) and a panel of private sector contractors. Homes are also addressed on an area-based approach through a separate strand. Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.</p><p>Eligible homeowners apply for the scheme either directly through SEAI or via their local CBO, although the SEAI maintains a national waiting list in order to ensure appropriate national coverage.  While CBOs typically control delivery within their specific area, where the SEAI identify delays private contractors are asked to assist in order to reduce waiting times.  My Department has been advised by the SEAI that there were 3,036 homes on the waiting list on 23 September 2013.  This is broken down as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Total Number of Applications</b></th><th><b>Outstanding Applications (Homes not fully completed yet)</b></th><th><b>Status:</b><br /><b>Not yet Surveyed</b></th><th><b>Status:</b><br /><b>Survey Completed</b></th><th><b>Status:</b><br /><b>Allocated to Contractor for Works</b></th><th><b>Status:</b><br /><b>With CBO for Delivery</b></th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>26,573</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>17,346</td><td>227</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>121</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>9,572</td><td>2,805</td><td>866</td><td>139</td><td>581</td><td>1,219</td></tr></table></p><p>There was a significant increase in the volume of applications received over the period from 2009 - 2011, which led to an increase in the waiting list in certain instances.  However, as the above table clearly indicates, the number of outstanding applications has greatly reduced in recent years.  The four homes on the waiting list from 2011 have been allocated to contractors for delivery.  The oldest application is on one of the Aran islands and this will be completed shortly in conjunction with an SEAI Area based project currently under way on the islands.</p><p>There are a number of ways in which my Department is working with the SEAI to improve the overall delivery of the scheme.  During 2013, the SEAI improved its reporting capability to ensure that they are fully aware of any significant delays in the delivery of the scheme.  The waiting list is reviewed on a weekly basis, in conjunction with my Department. Additionally, measures were put in place to ensure there was no break in CBO contracts during the transition from 2012 to 2013, and therefore no break in service as was the case in previous years.  This measure ensured that contractors were operational much earlier than in previous years.  Furthermore, various operational and IT related improvements have been made to improve delivery of the scheme and plans are being developed to introduce additional improvements to service delivery.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Kerry, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie.</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  Broadband services under the NBS are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in the designated NBS Electoral Divisions.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.  The area referred to in the Deputy's question is serviced under the NBS.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published last Autumn, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Kerry. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  I understand that the Non Principal Private Residence Charge has raised &euro;75.7 m in respect of 2012 liabilities to date, a portion of which has been collected in 2013.  As such, were the Charge to continue to operate in 2014 and if it were to be set at &euro;3 50 or &euro;400 I would anticipate revenue in excess of &euro;1 30 m or &euro;150m respectively , assuming similar compliance levels . However, 2013 will be the final year of the operation of the Charge.  The Local Property Tax has been introduced on a half year basis this year and accordingly 50% of the Tax is payable in 2013. From 2014, the Tax will operate on a full year basis.</p></reply>

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  In the interest of fairness and equity, Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order based on the date of receipt in the GCVU and all organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  It is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and I have given this matter particular priority.  In that regard I have been actively engaged with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 134 whole-time equivalent staff (130 civilians and 4 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013.  Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks.  Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU.  This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to the average staff allocation of 78 at the Unit over the past two and a half years, represents an increase of 117%.</p><p>  Development of an e-Vetting solution is underway.  This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received.  The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place in the fourth quarter of 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

At the end of August 2013 there were 239 asylum applications pending in ORAC and 533 appeals pending in RAT.</p><p>  While the current median processing time from date of initial application at ORAC through the appeal stage at RAT, to a final Ministerial decision is 8 months, some cases can take longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues, or because of judicial review proceedings.  A person who is refused a declaration of refugee status is, in addition to other options, notified of their entitlement under the leave to remain process, to apply for subsidiary protection in the State.  This is separate to the refugee status determination process.  The Deputy may be aware that I am intending to introduce new arrangements in the near future in regard to the processing of subsidiary protection applications.</p><p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their application for protection in the State is being processed.  Currently, RIA provides accommodation to 4,414 persons in 34 centres located in 16 counties throughout the State.  Details on where these centres are located as well as other detailed information and statistics about RIA's functions are on RIA's website: www.ria.gov.ie.</p><p>  The Deputy's attention is drawn to the <i>Value for Money Report and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme</i>  (also available on RIA'a website), which provides an in-depth analysis of the accommodation provided and its costs.  Currently, the weekly average cost per person in commercial direct provision centres is &euro;206.25.  This figure includes all expenditure on food, school lunch packs, heating, maintenance and housekeeping, water and sewerage, bed linen and towels, toiletries, staffing security, etc.  It does not include the cost of medical, educational, and welfare costs for RIA residents.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of integration, it should be borne in mind that, unlike Programme Refugees for instance, to whom a formal integration process applies, it is not a matter of certainty that an international protection applicant will require 'future integration into the community'.  Specific measures to promote the integration of asylum seekers into the community are not taken pending clarification as to their status in the State.  In reality, a level of integration takes place anyway given that asylum accommodation centres are not closed, children of residents attend local schools and residents avail of medical services in the same way as Irish citizens living in the same locality.</p><p>  Although not intended as a formal integration process, RIA's contracts for accommodation encourages all contractors to facilitate the provision of any classes or courses provided by any bona fide organisation willing to offer services to residents.  Some centres facilitate the provision of a variety of classes such as IT skills, parenting classes, sewing. etc.  Projects providing reception supports to asylum seekers are eligible for grants from the European Refugee Fund eg. actions that address social, medical, and information needs of the target group.  There is also an added focus on certain vulnerable groups among asylum seekers.</p></reply>

The manual sets out the detailed considerations which must always be taken into account by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before using incapacitant spray.  Any use of incapacitant spray, as with any use of force in general, must be in accordance with law, in particular the law on the use of force set out in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  In effect, the use of incapacitant spray must be  necessary and must be reasonable in the circumstances.</p><p>  Garda members are trained in the lawful use of incapacitant spray and, as the manual makes clear, are individually responsible and answerable for their actions in its use.  It is also the case that every incident where incapacitant spray is deployed is notified to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which can investigate any question of misuse.  The fundamental principle underpinning Garda policy on the use of force is that any action taken must comply with the fundamental principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and accountability and be applied in a non-discriminatory manner in accordance with the principles of the European Convention of Human Rights.  In carrying out their duties, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall, as far as practicable and in so far as the circumstances dictate, consider non-physical means prior to resorting to the use of force.  I believe, therefore, that comprehensive policy and procedures in relation to the use of incapacitant spray, and appropriate safeguards to ensure compliance with those standards, have been put in place.  I have been informed that the use of Incapacitant Spray on the 18th September, 2013 during a policing operation in the vicinity of Government Buildings was in accordance with the above policy.</p></reply>

While the original objective of free movement was to facilitate labour mobility the focus of Community law has since shifted towards family reunification which dominates more recent secondary legislation and jurisprudence of the Court of Justice in this regard.</p><p>  However, our experience is no different to that of other Member States where the free movement legal framework has been abused by those seeking to circumvent proper immigration controls to enter the State.  One such abuse, which has emerged from the now well documented trend towards unusual patterns of marriage between European citizens and third country nationals, relates to sham marriages or marriages of convenience.   Marriages of convenience are notoriously difficult to prove and our constitutional protection of marriage makes uncovering theses situations more problematic.</p><p>  This is a complex issue and there is no single, legislative or operational approach that will permanently eliminate the problem.  The authorities deploy a range of measures and cooperate closely in tackling this problem.  This is a high priority of all the services, agencies and other organisations tasked with preventing or negating any benefits to the persons who engage in theses activities.</p><p>  In addition to our operational response I have asked my officials to re-examine the provisions in the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2010 and to draft amendments dealing with immigration related marriages of convenience and sham marriages.  A similar approach is being taken in respect of the Free Movement Regulations that transposed the EU Directive into Irish law.  I also understand that officials from the Department of Social Protection are examining possible legislative measures to address the civil registration aspects of marriages of convenience.</p><p>  At the European level there are also a number of initiatives focused at abuse on legal migration channels such as marriages of convenience.  In 2009 the Commission published guidelines on the better implementation of Directive 38/2004/EC on Free Movement.  The guidelines contained a specific chapter of abuse and fraud which included some guidance on identifying marriages of convenience.  More recently; in 2012, the Commission began work, in consultation with Member States, on drawing up a handbook for practitioners investigation shame marriages or marriages of convenience.  We understand that work is well advance in relation to a number of chapters of this handbook.  Another initiative, which began under the Irish Presidency of the European Council, focuses on abuses of the free movement legal framework highlighted by a group of concerned Member States earlier this year.  The Commission is actively engaged in collecting evidence of the abuses and fraud concerned and will report back to the Council in October and December of this year.</p></reply>

In turn the definition of 'criminal conduct' makes specific provision in relation to conduct which occurs outside the State. In this regard, 'criminal conduct is defined as &quot;any conduct --<blockquote>(<i>a</i>  ) which constitutes an offence or more than one offence, or<br /><br />(<i>b</i>  ) which occurs outside the State and which would constitute an offence or more than one offence -- (i) if it occurred within the State,<br /><br />(ii) if it constituted an offence under the law of the state or territory concerned, and<br /><br />(iii) if, at the time when an application is being made for an interim order or interlocutory order, any property obtained or received at any time (whether before or after the passing of this Act) by or as a result of or in connection with the conduct is situated within the State&quot;</blockquote>  Furthermore, in the context of criminal justice mutual legal assistance, the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 provides a framework for the freezing, confiscation and forfeiture of property which is situated in the State and which was received or obtained as a result of or in connection with conduct which, if it occurred in the State, would constitute an indictable offence.</p></reply>

Given that Ireland and UK have traditionally operated a rabies free zone, both States agreed, on a risk analysis basis, that border compliance checks would not be undertaken.</p><p>  However, an increased focus by authorities within the UK on illegal puppy imports from elsewhere in the EU has lead to two recent incidents of dogs from Ireland being seized/detained in Britain, and the risk of further such incidents is likely to increase.  In view of this, any person travelling with dogs to Britain is being advised by my Department to ensure that their exports are compliant with EU law as soon as possible.  </p><p>  While Ireland and the UK have been rabies free for many decades, Western Europe is now also free of rabies.  The harmonised EU system under which passports and rabies vaccinations are required  allows dog owners to bring their pets into and out of Ireland without a compulsory and lengthy quarantine.  While both Ireland and the UK sought and achieved a legal provision providing the possibility of a derogation from rabies vaccination for non commercial pets movements from 2015, this was not extended to commercial traffic which includes any change of ownership.  I understand that one charity is undertaking significant capital investment which should to some extent relieve the concerns expressed by some small charities about the cost of complying with EU rules.</p></reply>

The EU Regulation was changed with effect from May 2001 to specify the present EU MLS of 95mm.  The EU Regulation permits Member States to enact national measures supplementing or going beyond the minimum requirements specified in the EU Regulation, provided they are restricted to the Member State&rsquo;s own fishing vessels or to persons established in that Member State.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Crawfish (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 232 of 2006) prohibit the landing, transhipment, retention on board, or sale of crawfish below a national minimum landing size of 110mm.  Ireland enacted this higher national MLS in 2001 as it was considered that the lower EU MLS introduced in 2001 offered no conservation protection for the species which was suffering from severe over-fishing.</p><p>  In 2011, I asked BIM and the Marine Institute to conduct a review of Ireland&rsquo;s technical conservation measures for crawfish.  The Review was conducted in consultation with crawfish fishermen, shellfish buyers and other stakeholders.  That Review concluded that a reduction in the national MLS to 95mm would lead to a circa 42% reduction in the reproductive potential of the crawfish stock.  A sustainable crawfish fishery could not be maintained in those circumstances.</p><p>  It is worth noting that the Review found that 110mm is in fact the most commonly adopted MLS in Northern Europe.</p></reply>

A parallel consultation is underway on shrimp stock management.  The deadline for submissions has been extended to 25 October 2013 which I hope will facilitate the participation of all interested parties.</p><p>  Currently there are two legal restrictions which provide protection to the lobster stock, namely a minimum landing size of 87mm and a prohibition on fishing v-notched lobsters, all of which are over 87mm. The minimum landing size protects juvenile lobster and allows some spawning to occur before lobsters enter the fishery.  The v-notch regulation prohibits the landing of v-notched lobsters until the notch is repaired by growth (usually occurs over 2-4 years) thus allowing such lobsters to contribute to spawning and thereby promote sustainability of the lobster stock.</p><p>Recent stock assessments, and evaluation of the existing conservation measures, indicate that spawning stock is not adequately protected and recruitment to lobster stocks may be impaired.  Having examined the issue with scientific experts from the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, I am now seeking stakeholder input on two alternative proposals; either to introduce a <i>maximum</i> landing size of 127mm or to increase the <i>minimum</i>   landing size from 87mm to 90mm.  The published consultation documents are available online on my Department's website and copies have been made available at the coastal offices of BIM, the Marine Institute and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. In addition copies have been circulated to v-notching co-operatives, fisheries producer organisations and the Environmental Pillar.  </p><p>  I would encourage all stakeholders, particularly those currently engaged in lobster fishing, to participate in the assessment of these proposals. On conclusion of the consultation stage, I will review the submissions received with scientific experts before determining the most appropriate measure to ensure the sustainability of the lobster stock.  </p></reply>

Health checks at the posts are carried out by official veterinarians of my Department.  The identity and documentation of all products are checked at the first point of entry into the EU and some products are checked physically. Commission Regulation No 136/2004 lays down procedures for veterinary checks at Community border inspection posts on products imported from third countries.  Seafood imports from other EU countries do not need to undergo these checks.  </p><p>  In order to import fish or fishery products into Ireland from a non EU country the person who wishes to import fish/fishery products is required to register with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).  The SFPA and the Border Inspection Posts operate an agreed sampling plan, which is reviewed annually, to ensure that they meet the EU criteria with respect to potential contaminants, and for the presence of any medical residues or where there is concern that the product may not be fit for human consumption.  In accordance with the Commission Regulation, the plan is based upon the nature of the products and the risk they represent, taking into account all relevant monitoring parameters such as frequency and number of incoming consignments and results of previous monitoring.</p><p>  The SFPA was set up by the Oireachtas under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 as the independent Authority for the implementation of sea-fisheries and seafood law from boat up to but excluding retail level (on fishing vessels, in shellfish production areas, in establishments handling preparing and processing seafood).

These protocols are considered to be more advanced than those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</p><p>- The inspection regime is totally independent of the industry.</p><p>- Data obtained as a result of inspections is published and made widely available.</p><p>- Treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.</p><p>  In 2008, the State introduced a new Pest Management Strategy, supplementing the control regime already in place.  This has resulted in a steady decline in average sea lice numbers on farmed salmon since its inception.</p><p>  Applications to my Department for licences for the cultivation of marine finfish are considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act.  The legislation provides for a period of public consultation.

Netherlands raised the question of the EU TRACES computer system, which records data on movements of live animals, calling for greater transparency in regard to the information recorded on this system.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-26a.636.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013092600054#WRT02000"><p>The Deputy has raised a number of separate issues which I will deal with individually.</p><p>  In relation to the Independent Child Death Review Group (ICDRG), the Deputy will be aware that when I published the report of the group, I accepted that action in the areas identified was required.  The necessary actions are being implemented in the context of the Government's reform programme for children's services.  The integrated delivery of these reforms will ensure that responses to many of the ICDRG recommendations will be mainstreamed into the work programme of the new Child and Family Agency. HSE Children and Family Services are proactively planning, and will publish as part of the service planning process, specific actions to continue to improve the quality of its services and to address the recommendations highlighted in ICDRG report. The development of a quality assurance framework for social work services will be an integral part of the progress which is being made in this regard.</p><p>  In relation to the numbers of social workers employed in Children and Family Services in the HSE, the latest HSE employment census indicates that the number of whole-time equivalent (WTE) social workers employed in the HSE Children and Families service area was 1,405.53 at the end of July 2013. The census numbers reflect the outcome of a process of re-classification of social workers within the HSE into individual care groups, including Children and Families, to support the process of establishing the new Child and Family Agency. Consequently direct comparisons with social work numbers for previous years are not meaningful. It should be noted that there are a variety of reasons for fluctuations in employment census figures at any given time, particularly as the employment census is based on a snapshot of staff who are on the payroll at the date of the census.  Among the reasons for staff being removed from the payroll thereby causing changes in employment census numbers (aside from retirements and recruitment) are deaths, career breaks and other unpaid leave, resignations and unpaid sick leave.</p><p>  In the context of the current budgetary restriction across the public sector and within the HSE there is a general pause on all recruitment including those grades included in the list of specified grades with delegated sanction from the general moratorium on recruitment and promotion within the public service. However due to the importance of child welfare and protection responsibilities every effort is made to maintain staffing levels. In this regard for Children and Family Services a National Employment Control Group has been established to consider all vacancies as they arise. This situation is under constant review. In the event of a change of staffing in the management of particular cases normal procedures are followed to ensure that all files and records are up to date and that there is a process of full briefing and introduction for new staff under the supervision of line management. Statutory child care Regulations and Standards are followed in all circumstances to ensure the best welfare of the child(ren).</p><p>  As regards the publication of independent reviews into child deaths, I am informed by the HSE that seven review reports have been submitted for publication. These will be published in the next month together with the Child Death Review Panel's Annual reports for 2011 and 2012, outlining in detail the work referred to and completed by the panel.</p><p>  In relation to the fourth and final progress report on Ryan Report Implementation Plan, this will be published on schedule before the end of 2013</p><p>  On the matter of aftercare, Section 45 of the Childcare Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view in relation to each person leaving care as to whether there is a &quot;need for assistance&quot; and if it forms such a view to provide services in accordance with the section and subject to resources. All young people who have had a care history with the HSE are entitled to an Aftercare Service. The extent as to what is provided is based on assessment of need, age and the length of time the young person was in care. Good practice clearly indicates that where a young person needs to be in care, they should remain in their placement until they are ready to leave. Preparation for leaving care is an integral part of the care placement and is introduced formally to young people usually at 16 years of age. This preparation, determined by a comprehensive needs assessment,  sets out a process of targeted and structured support to enable the young person to make a smooth transition from statutory care to independent living, where appropriate. Data in regard to the number of children who left Care on reaching their eighteenth birthday began to be collected in 2012. Similar data was not collected for previous years. The number of young adults aged 18 to 20 (inclusive) in receipt of an aftercare service on the last day of the reporting period at 31.03.2013 was 1,149.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I am currently examining options, in association with the Attorney General, to strengthen legislation regarding the provision of aftercare. I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated my intention to bring forward legislative amendments in the legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency, and this remains my focus.  <font color="#FF0000"> </font></p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's final query around cuts, it is self evident that reductions in budgets in recent years have provided challenges for Children and Family Services management. The priority has been to continue to deliver the maximum level of safe statutory services possible within available resources. The key areas of service provision are as follows: promoting the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection; providing a wide range of Care services for children requiring care and protection; providing for the provision of a range of family support services, including by voluntary bodies and other persons and providing a range of adoption services.</p><p>  In responding to this challenging budgetary environment Children and Family Services has, where possible, identified the impact of pre-existing and future risks on delivering the planned service levels outlined in Service Plans while continuing to operate within its budget. The priority has been in all areas of statutory responsibility to maintain, and in some service areas, to increase service levels. Some examples of this increase in service delivery are: Between 2009- 2012 there has been an increase of 44.27% in the number of foster families from   2,959 to 4,269; between 2009 - 2012 child abuse referrals have increased by   58%; between 2009 - 2012 the number of children in Care has increased by   11.5%.  There has been a significant increase in the provision of Aftercare services.</p><p>  In conclusion, I would state that the Government is currently engaged in the most ambitious programme of reform of services to children and families ever undertaken. The central element of this programme is the establishment of the new Child &amp;amp; Family Agency. However, it should be noted that even ahead of the formal establishment of the Agency there is a significant level of work already underway to reform child and family services. The 'change management programme' being developed by the senior management team of the new Agency involves over 100 individual reform projects which will introduce operational improvement to the services for which the Agency will be responsible. Some of the specific initiatives included in this change management programme include reorganisation of residential care centres into a national service under a single national manager; ongoing measures to specify child welfare and protection referral pathways and ensure consistency in the management of referrals; review of caseloads; reforming the interface with the courts system; ongoing support for implementation of Children First; reform of data management including additional performance information and the introduction of a National Child Care Information System; and new internal structures and processes to improve quality assurance.</p></reply>

The reconfiguration of services is in line with national policy, and with similar initiatives undertaken or planned elsewhere in the country.  It clearly underpins the commitment of the Government to progress further implementation of <i>A Vision for Change</i> in line with evolving service priorities and  overall resource availability.</p><p>  At present, there are 35 acute psychiatric beds in Galway city, and 22 acute psychiatric beds in both Ballinasloe and Roscommon.  This gives a total of 79 beds, serving a population of around 315,000. <i>A Vision for Change</i>  recommends 50 beds for a catchment population of 300,000.  It is clear therefore, in line with policy and operational norms nationally, that the provision of 22 beds in both Ballinasloe and Roscommon means that the current overall stock of 79 in HSE West is too high in relative terms, allied to a corresponding under-development of community based mental health services.</p><p>  To address this situation, a purpose built 50 bed acute mental health unit will be completed in Galway University Hospital in 2015, to replace the existing smaller unit. This Unit will consist of 35 general adult mental health beds, with the remaining 15 beds relating to psychiatry of later life, eating disorders, and mental health and intellectual disability.  The acute unit in Roscommon will continue to provide 22 general adult mental health beds.</p><p>  The re-organisation of services by HSE West will provide a total of 57 general adult mental health beds.  This will be a sufficient number of acute psychiatric beds, as envisaged under <i>A Vision for Change</i>, while allowing the Executive to enhance much needed community based services through re-deployment of some staff from acute services.  It is intended that staff from St. Brigid's, Ballinasloe will be redeployed on a phased basis, to both community mental health teams locally and to the acute units in Galway and Roscommon.  This initiative will not give rise to any job losses, and there will be no negative impact for existing patients in Ballinasloe. </p><p>  I am assured by the HSE that the capital investment for the development referred to the Deputy was necessary as the facility required certain infrastructural works to be carried out.  In addition, the intention was to refurbish the facility so that it could be adaptable for use for both administrative and front line services.  The works were therefore designed to optimise flexibility around future service delivery, including for acute or community based mental health provision.  </p><p>   Each year the HSE multi-annual Capital Plan requires the approval of the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This project was included in the HSE capital programme which was approved by the Minister for Health.

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  One of the recommendations of the Forum was to amend the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations, 1965 to redefine the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to between 0.6 and 0.8ppm.  This came into effect in 2007. </p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, continuously monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by major international scientifically validated reviews.  At present a research project &quot;Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth&quot; (FACCT) is being conducted by the Oral Health Services Research Centre, University College Cork and supported by the HSE.  It is focusing on 5-year old and 12-year old children and will assess the on-going benefits of  health promotion initiatives, including water fluoridation, given the changes that have occurred since the levels of fluoride were reduced in 2007.  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

I am committed to the implementation of the proposals for reform arising from the  review.  To this end, I have arranged a series of bilateral meetings  with Government departments and agencies, the community and voluntary sector and the drugs task forces  in the coming weeks.  The purpose of these meetings is to discuss  how we can maintain and strengthen the inter-agency approach to the National Drugs Strategy in order to ensure successful implementation of the Drugs Task Force reforms. </p></reply>

The reduction in the numbers holding private health insurance, the age profile of those holding private health insurance, increases in claims costs, increases in premiums, and the overall state of the economy are all having an impact on the private health insurance market and its sustainability.  </p><p>  I am determined to address rising costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  I want insurers to address the base cost of each element of claims which they pay and have made it clear to private health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, ultimately reducing the impact of rising health costs on health insurance premiums for the consumer.  </p><p>  While pricing decisions in relation to products are a matter for the private health insurers, I understand that key factors influencing price increases generally include the increasing volume and cost of claims and an ageing membership, in addition to ongoing medical innovations, which while welcome, have an impact on the cost of care.  A significant number of the private health insurance claims are for procedures which are performed  in private facilities, and the negotiated price for procedures in private hospitals is a &quot;package&quot; price, which may include the cost of surgery, drugs, pathology, and accommodation.</p><p>  Last year I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, comprising representatives from the private health insurance companies, my Department, and the Health Insurance Authority,  to generate ideas to address health insurance costs.  I appointed an independent Chairperson Mr. Pat McLoughlin, who will work with my Department and the insurers under the auspices of the Forum on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market.  I want all insurers to address the base cost of their claims and to see all procedures provided in an appropriate, safe, healthcare setting.  </p><p>  It is imperative that the cost of health insurance is contained to secure the sustainability of the private health insurance market and to prepare for the move to a system of Universal Health Insurance.  </p></reply>

While the majority of doctors are sourced internally, a number of posts are filled through recruitment of doctors from overseas. </p><p>  Some challenges remain, mainly in smaller hospitals and in certain specialties, including Emergency Medicine and General Medicine at Registrar level. Where sites continue to experience challenges in terms of vacancies, hospital management implement contingency plans. If necessary, hospitals make locum arrangements to ensure continued service delivery. System reform, in particular the implementation of the Report on Hospital Groups and the Framework for the Development of Smaller Hospitals will assist in achievement of a more focused and efficient deployment of NCHD staffing.  These changes will build on the significant work that has been done through the HSE National Clinical programmes in recent years. </p><p>  I am committed to improving the working-conditions of NCHDs and to ensuring that they can have a suitable career pathway within the Irish health system.  Intensive work is underway in all hospitals to pursue compliance with the EWTD on junior doctors&rsquo; working-hours. At the end of July this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs.  I see this as a modernising initiative which is needed urgently and which will, in future years, support the retention of sufficient numbers of doctors trained in Ireland within the system. </p></reply>
