    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-16a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013051600047#WRA00600"><p>I am aware of the report released by Human Rights Watch on 22 April concerning the ongoing situation in Rakhine State - also known as Arakan State - in Myanmar/Burma. I am deeply concerned by the reports of grave human rights violations, including allegations of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.</p><p>  On 21 March 2013, the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member, adopted resolution 22/14 on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.  The Irish Presidency of the European Union played a key role in the drafting and negotiation of the EU-led resolution, which expresses particular concern about the Rohingya minority in Rakhine/Arakan State and persisting inter-communal tension.  The resolution urges the Government of Myanmar/Burma to take action to protect the human rights of the Rohingya, and to repeal and/or amend laws that deny the Rohingya the right to birth registration, the ability to marry and freedom of movement, including equal access to citizenship.  The resolution also calls upon the Government to ensure that those responsible for violence in Rakhine/Arakan State are held to account and urges it to grant safe, timely, full and unhindered humanitarian access to all persons in need and to facilitate the voluntary return of individuals to their original communities.  The resolution also extends for one year the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. </p><p>  On 29 April, the Government of Myanmar/Burma released the report of an independent commission, tasked by the President of Myanmar, U Thein Sein, in mid-2012, with uncovering the root causes of sectarian violence in Rakhine/Arakan State.  I welcome the various commitments made by the President since the release of the Commission&rsquo;s report, including a commitment to take all necessary actions to ensure the basic human rights of Muslims in Rakhine/Arakan State, to uphold the rights to freedom of religion and freedom of speech and to address the humanitarian situation.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, on 22 April 2013, at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, the EU decided to lift all sanctions on Myanmar/Burma, with the exception of the arms embargo and an embargo on equipment which might be used for internal oppression.  This decision was taken in the light of the broader political and economic reforms that have been taking place in Myanmar/Burma since 2011 as part of the process of democratisation, and further to the Council&rsquo;s decision to suspend sanctions in April 2012. </p><p>  In conjunction with the decision to lift sanctions, there was also a discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council on areas where further progress by Myanmar/Burma is expected, including issues related to ethnic conflict.  Furthermore, the EU is providing development assistance amounting to &euro;75m to Myanmar/Burma, including a &euro;19m humanitarian programme, which largely responds to needs arising from ethnic violence and extremism.</p><p>  Looking to the future, it is critical that the international community&rsquo;s engagement with, and support to, Myanmar/Burma is carefully and comprehensively structured.  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Rakhine/Arakan State, including at the Human Rights Council.</p></reply>

As I have said previously, the Government supports any development that could lead to definitive peace in the Basque Country. Six of the individuals in question were arrested as a result of their conviction by the Supreme Court on 9 April of membership of an illegal armed organisation. A further two people were arrested for resisting the police during protests aimed at preventing the arrests of the six people convicted by the Supreme Court.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on these arrests nor to speculate on the possible impact that they might have.</p></reply>

Reports suggest that, as in an earlier episode in January, a convoy delivering advanced weapons including missiles to Hezbollah in Lebanon was attacked. The missiles were said to have been supplied originally by Iran. A Syrian army base on the outskirts of Damascus seems also to have been hit: this is said to have been a staging or storage area for Hezbollah weapons, and may also have had a role in chemical weapons research or production for Syria.</p><p>  There are reports, from serious sources but again unconfirmed, that Israel has passed a message to Syria that it is not intervening in the Syrian conflict, but acting solely to prevent weapons reaching Hezbollah. Significant numbers of Hezbollah fighters are in turn reported fighting on the side of the Assad regime in Syria.</p><p>  The growing complexity and danger of escalation of these events to engulf the wider region is clear, and I would expect that this will feature in discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council on 27 May which I will attend.</p></reply>

It is expected that this issue will again be discussed at the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting in May, although the agenda for this meeting has not yet been finalised.  </p><p>  Recent discussions have focused in particular on prospects for reviving the peace process following the elections in Israel and re-engagement by the new US Administration.  The EU has always recognised that it would be very difficult to restart negotiations on the Middle East without the active engagement of the United States.  We are therefore anxious to give all the support we can to renewed involvement by the US.  The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is treating the peace process as a personal priority and has made several visits to the region.  President Obama&rsquo;s decision to visit Israel in March, at the start of his second term, was also very welcome. His clear outreach to Israeli public opinion will hopefully help to add momentum to the process.  I conveyed to Secretary Kerry the strong encouragement of the EU and discussed the prospects for making progress at a meeting which I had with him in Washington on 18 March, just before he left for Israel.</p><p>  While the resumption of talks is a key priority, the EU has also become increasingly concerned that the relentless expansion of the Israeli settlement programme is fast approaching a point where it will be physically impossible to construct a viable Palestinian state on the ground.  The EU has therefore pressed for changes in these policies and for action on a range of practical issues on the ground which are inhibiting the prospects for a viable peace process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-16a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013051600047#WRA01500"><p>I am aware of the allegations that chemical weapons have been used in Syria.  Any use of chemical weapons would have appalling humanitarian consequences, is clearly contrary to international legal norms and must be utterly condemned.  British, French, US and Turkish intelligence sources have indicated that material they have recovered indicates the possible use of the nerve agent sarin.  At the moment, the available evidence is neither categorical, nor can it give a clear picture of who used the gas, as allegations have been made against both the Syrian authorities and opposition forces. What is clear is that an extremely worrying picture is emerging.   </p><p>  The European Union has repeatedly called on the Syrian authorities never to use its chemical weapons and to store them securely pending destruction under independent verification.  We have made the same calls in a national capacity.  At the recent Review Conference of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which took place only last month, the EU again expressed its grave concern at the allegations.  The 188 States Party to the Convention agreed that &lsquo;the use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances would be reprehensible and completely contrary to the legal norms and standards of the international community&rsquo;. Regrettably, Syria is not a party to this Convention but it is bound by the 1925 Geneva Protocol which prohibits the use of chemical weapons.</p><p>  The EU has also written to the United Nations Secretary-General to insist that the investigation into allegations of use of chemical weapons in Syria which he is attempting to establish have unfettered access within Syria and that it must be comprehensive and investigate all serious allegations.  While discussions on the subject are ongoing in New York, it has not proven possible so far for the investigation team to commence its work as the Syrian authorities have refused to agree to the Terms of Reference requested by the Secretary-General.  The most recent information to emerge from Syria clearly makes it all the more urgent that this investigation be allowed to proceed without delay.  I call on the Syrian authorities to agree the Terms of Reference immediately to enable the investigation to begin its important work.</p></reply>

The bridge would open up the cross-border Cooley, Mournes, and Gullion region to many more visitors, making it much easier for residents, businesses and tourists to travel and to interconnect.  </p><p>  As well as the long-term tourism and infrastructural benefits that the bridge would undoubtedly bring to the area, there would also be a very valuable economic spin-off during the construction phase of the project, with a boost to employment.</p><p>  I am conscious that concerns have been expressed about the delay in giving the project final approval.  I and my colleagues in government have relayed these concerns to our colleagues in the Northern Ireland executive.  I discussed the issue with First Minister Peter Robinson, on the occasion of the NSMC Institutional meeting in Belfast on 29 April last. </p><p>  I was pleased to note that at a meeting of the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) on 10 May last, which was chaired by the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, Sammy Wilson MP MLA, Ministers noted that it was important that the small number of projects still outstanding must be approved in a timely manner by the accountable Departments, so as to ensure that they can be implemented within the relevant EU deadline.</p><p>  The project is currently going through the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) Accountable Department approval process. DFP has indicated that it is fully aware of the high level of interest in the project, that it is conscious of the urgent timelines involved, and that it is working to complete all necessary processes as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Government is keeping this matter under very close consideration.</p></reply>

We monitor developments in Nigeria closely through our Ambassador and his staff in Abuja, in close consultation with EU and other international partners.  We have consistently condemned the violence in Nigeria, and the acts of terror Boko Haram have been perpetrating.</p><p>  The EU also maintains a strong dialogue with the Nigerian authorities on the political and security situation and on issues related to the Nigerian Government&rsquo;s response to terrorism.  Indeed, Minister of State Joe Costello is today representing the European Union at the EU-Nigeria Ministerial Dialogue meeting, a regular forum for high-level exchange between the EU and Nigeria on issues of mutual interest and concern.  The political and security situation in will be discussed, as well as economic and development issues and shared regional and global challenges.</p><p>  The position of Ireland and the European Union is clear.  We support the Nigerian authorities in their efforts to confront terrorism and bring those responsible to justice while maintaining the rule of law and observing and protecting human rights for all citizens of the country.  The armed group Boko Haram must end their campaign of violence, lay down their weapons and pursue any policies or grievances they have through peaceful means and dialogue.  </p><p>  In April, the President of Nigeria established a 'Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North'. It has been tasked with considering a 60-day timeframe for dialogue with members of Boko Haram and disarmament. More recently, it appears that this timeframe has been extended to 90 days.  </p><p>  The EU will continue to support equitable and inclusive social and economic development in Nigeria, with special emphasis on addressing the root causes of marginalisation and conflict.</p></reply>

The Israeli and Palestinian populations of Jerusalem are treated very differently in administrative and legal terms.  Israeli Government policy is explicitly aimed at reducing the Palestinian proportion of the population, leading in practice to measures which make life difficult for Palestinians and put them under pressure to leave and move elsewhere in the Occupied Territory.  This substantial report, which my Department is studying with interest, will, I believe, be very helpful in supporting the case made by Ireland for some time that it is necessary to focus on the many practical difficulties which affect the lives of Palestinians and which are aimed - I regret to say deliberately - at pressurising them into abandoning their existing communities. The report details the very small proportion of state and municipal revenues spent proportionately in Palestinian communities in Jerusalem in welfare, education and health and the movement and other restrictions which greatly hinder daily life and economic activity for Palestinians.  The Deputy correctly notes that a major result of this situation is a markedly higher level of poverty, including among children, in the Palestinian community.  To extract just one indicator among many, it is reported that spending on education in Jewish communities in West Jerusalem is more than four times higher <i>per capita</i>   than in Palestinian areas of East Jerusalem.</p><p>  These are issues which Ireland has already been pressing, particularly at EU level, and I am sure that this important report will feed usefully into those discussions.</p></reply>

If investments in agriculture are designed to enhance nutrition outcomes, we can help stop the devastating and irreversible consequences of under-nutrition on child development and we can increase the economic potential of nations. It is estimated that eliminating under-nutrition in very young children could add up to 11 per cent to GDP growth in countries in Africa.</p><p>  My Department hosted a major international conference on hunger-nutrition-climate justice, in partnership with the Mary Robinson Foundation-Climate Justice, on 15-16 April in Dublin Castle. A significant proportion of those who participated in the conference were representatives of local communities from the developing world who are most affected by these linked challenges. During that conference I heard from smallholder farmers who shared their experiences of trying to grow diverse and nutritious food in a world impacted by climate change. I committed to bringing their messages to international policy discussions.</p><p>  To that end I hosted an event with my Canadian counterpart on &lsquo;Investing in Agriculture for Nutrition&rsquo; during the Spring Meetings of the World Bank in Washington DC on 19 April. </p><p>  The event brought together key policy makers within the World Bank, along with the President of the Global Development Programme at the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).</p><p>  The discussions highlighted the courses of action that could help to incentivise efforts to leverage agricultural investment to improve nutrition.  I shared the key messages from the Dublin conference, including in particular, the importance of empowering poor households and communities to engage in decision making. I strongly advocated that our response to these global challenges must be based on the needs and views of the people most directly involved.</p><p>  I was delighted that Ireland and Canada were able to partner together in this way to advance the importance of allocating resources for nutrition and leveraging investments in other sectors, particularly agriculture. I was impressed by the progress that has been made by the World Bank in shaping its policies to be more nutrition focussed. This approach is key to achieving better nutritional outcomes. It will not just help children to grow and develop to their full potential, but with a better nourished workforce, developing countries will be able to further their own economic growth and development. </p></reply>

The situation was discussed most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Brussels on 11 March.  In February the Council adopted comprehensive Conclusions which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s support for international efforts to support stabilisation and counter the threat of terrorism in Mali, including the French-led Operation Serval and the African-led International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA). The Council also discussed the establishment and launch of an EU Training Mission in Mali, which is now working to support the strengthening and reform of the Malian army, including through important training in the area of human rights.  Ireland is contributing six trainers and two HQ personnel for the EU Training Mission.  The Council has emphasised the importance of progress on the political track and especially the implementation of the transition roadmap which has been agreed by the Malian Government and Parliament.  We have underlined in particular the preparations for free and fair elections scheduled to take place in the coming months, implementation of a meaningful national dialogue and reconciliation process, and the need to ensure full respect for human rights for all of Mali&rsquo;s citizens.</p><p>  The Council has emphasised the importance of progress on the political track and especially the implementation of the transition roadmap which has been agreed by the Malian Government and Parliament.  We have underlined in particular the preparations for free and fair elections scheduled to take place in the coming months, implementation of a meaningful national dialogue and reconciliation process, and the need to ensure full respect for human rights for all of Mali&rsquo;s citizens.    All of these issues were discussed in detail yesterday, 15 May, at a major international Donor Conference on Mali, jointly hosted by the EU and France in Brussels.  Ireland was represented at the conference by the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello T.D., who reiterated the Government&rsquo;s support for the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach in Mali. He also noted our support for the series of UN Security Council Resolutions on the situation in Mali, including Resolution 2100, adopted on 25 April, which authorises the establishment of the new UN Peacekeeping Operation for Mali, MINUSMA.  It will take over from AFISMA on 1 July.  The UN Mission has been given a mandate to use all necessary means to carry out its tasks, which include the   stabilisation of key population centres and the re-establishment of State authority throughout the country; support for the implementation of the transitional roadmap, and the promotion and protection of human rights. MINUSMA will comprise 11,200 troops and 1,440 police. </p><p>  At the conference yesterday, Minister of State Costello announced that Ireland will provide a further &euro;2.5 million to respond to continuing humanitarian needs and to support the recovery of Mali.  Already in 2013, Ireland has provided humanitarian assistance of over &euro;1.8 million.  Last year, the Government provided &euro;1.35 million for relief in Mali and &euro;9.25 million for the humanitarian crisis across the Sahel region.</p></reply>

The adoption of the Agreement was welcomed on behalf of the EU in a joint statement by High Representative Catherine Ashton and Development Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, which called on all sides to continue negotiating in good faith and to refrain from violence.   This important regional Agreement was reached by the Government of the DRC and ten neighbouring and regional countries.  The co-guarantors of the Agreement are the African Union, the Southern African Development Community, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the United Nations.  </p><p>  In the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s own words, a lasting solution in the DRC must have a number of essential elements.  It must be anchored in the political will of the leaders of all countries in the region.  It must address the structural causes fuelling instability in the DRC itself.  It must respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and legitimate concerns and interests of all concerned countries.  It also demands the commitment and long-term support of the international community.  Lasting peace can only be secured in the DRC if the Agreement is implemented in full and the opportunity it presents is now grasped by all parties involved.  </p><p>  I have welcomed the appointment of Mary Robinson by the UN Secretary General as his Special Envoy for the region, to support the implementation of the Agreement.  I have assured her of the full support of Government, and of the European Union.  The Secretary General is also proposing the establishment of an Intervention Brigade to address security aspects of the crisis more comprehensively.  </p><p>  Ireland is also responding to the appalling humanitarian consequences of the crisis in the DRC.  Since 2009, the Government has provided &euro;42.8 million for the victims of this humanitarian crisis.  Last year, we provided over &euro;10 Million in emergency and longer-term development funding to the DRC.  In April, I announced a further &euro;3.8 million in funding for UN agencies and NGOs working in the DRC.  Of this &euro;3.8 million, some &euro;2 million has been channelled through the Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC.  This is a multi-donor pooled funding mechanism under the direction of the Humanitarian Coordinator for the DRC. It provides quick and flexible funding to UN humanitarian agencies and international and national NGOs on the basis of the needs on the ground.  The UN&rsquo;s Humanitarian Action Plan for the DRC for 2013 provides overall strategic guidance for the Common Humanitarian Fund in order to enable aid organisations to reach nearly 4 million people with urgently-needed food, water, shelter, healthcare and education.</p><p>  The remaining &euro;1.8 million is being provided to Irish Aid NGO partners working in the DRC.  &euro;450,000 is being provided to Christian Aid, &euro;450.000 to Concern, &euro;300,000 to Tr&oacute;caire and &euro;580,000 to Oxfam (&euro;580,000).  It will be used to provide emergency food, water, health and protection to some of the most vulnerable people in the DRC. </p></reply>

Under-nutrition is an often silent element of hunger which has devastating consequences.  Over four in ten children under the age of five in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are undernourished.  Under-nutrition not only puts these children at greater risk of infection and death, but it also stops them reaching their full potential in school and ultimately achieving economic success and productivity.  In the context of its G8 Presidency, the British Government, in partnership with the Government of Brazil and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), will host a 'Day of International Action' entitled 'Nutrition for Growth: Beating Hunger through Business and Science' on 8 June 2013 in London. </p><p>  Ireland is a core partner on this initiative and I am pleased that the Taoiseach will attend this event at the invitation of British Prime Minister David Cameron.  It will build on the Olympic Hunger Summit held at Downing Street in August 2012 in which the Taoiseach participated. Ireland will continue its strong international advocacy and action on the importance of investment to address under-nutrition and to harness support for low income countries to address this challenge. </p><p>  I also welcome the opportunity to have dialogue on tax transparency in the forthcoming agenda of the G8 Summit.  Efficient and fair tax systems in developing countries are essential for sustainable growth, poverty reduction and the provision of basic services.  They are also vital for the promotion of good governance and for ensuring social cohesion.  Tax avoidance and evasion, therefore, present a major issue for developing countries seeking to drive their own development. </p><p>  Ireland is playing a strong role at national level and in global efforts to increase revenue generation and tackle tax avoidance and evasion in developing countries.  The brokering by Ireland of an agreement in the EU for the revision of the EU transparency and accounting directives, which when passed into legislation will improve transparency among EU multinational companies involved in extractive and logging industries in developing countries, is one recent example of this.</p><p>  Ireland's new Policy for International Development, <i>One World, One Future</i> , firmly commits to supporting developing countries to raise their own domestic revenue in ways that are more efficient, fairer and better promote good governance and equitable development.  In the Policy, the Government commits to advancing efforts to combat tax evasion, illicit financial flows and capital flight that are stripping developing countries of badly needed resources for the provision of basic services and the tackling of poverty. </p><p>  Ireland recognises that given the integrated nature of today's global financial and economic systems, many of the challenges in this area can only be overcome through international cooperation.  Bringing together as it does some of the world's major economic powers, the Tax, Trade and Transparency Summit on June 15 is therefore a very welcome initiative. Ireland, through the European Union's participation in this Summit, will push for ambitious steps to be taken on these matters.</p></reply>

On behalf of the Irish Government I have sent a message to the Turkish government via our embassy in Ankara expressing our condolences to the families of the innocent civilians killed and our sympathies to the injured.  We express our solidarity with the people and government of Turkey, who have generously extended protection to hundreds of thousands of refugees from the crisis in Syria. </p><p>  I visited Turkey from 7 to 10 April 2013.  This visit had a number of aspects, including a bilateral trade mission, political discussions on our bilateral relations with Turkey and Turkey&rsquo;s EU accession process, given Ireland&rsquo;s role as current Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Union.  I led the trade mission of 24 Enterprise Ireland companies, held discussions with Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ahmet Davotoğlu and Minister for EU Affairs, Mr. Egemen Bagiş. I also met President G&uuml;l, the Minister for the Economy, the Minister for Science and Technology and the Minister for Energy.  In addition, I visited Syrian refugee camps hosted by the Turkish Government in Gaziantep in south eastern Turkey. </p><p>  Dealing first with the trade mission, contracts of over &euro;30 million for Enterprise Ireland client companies were announced.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s market strategy in Turkey is focused in particular on energy and environmental services, pharmaceuticals, ICT, financial services, education and engineering sectors.  Companies from all these sectors were represented on the mission.  I also undertook a range of meetings with prominent business people and business organisations in Ankara and Istanbul, including TIM (the Turkish Exporters Assembly) which signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Irish Exporters Association.  Trade between Turkey and Ireland has grown by 20% over the past three years and exports by EI client companies to Turkey grew by 9% in 2012.  In all it was a very productive visit and laid the groundwork for even greater trade engagement between Ireland and Turkey in the future.</p><p>  I discussed Turkey&rsquo;s EU accession process with Ministers Davotoğlu and Bağiş and with President G&uuml;l.  Ireland has long been supportive of Turkish EU membership and one of our priorities is to reinvigorate the accession process during our Presidency.  Work is progressing in this area and we hope to be in a position to open a negotiating Chapter (Chapter 22 &ndash; Regional policy and co-ordination of structural instruments) in June.  Appreciation was expressed by my interlocutors for the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s efforts in this regard but so too was some frustration at the slow pace of Turkey&rsquo;s accession progress.  I urged that implementation by Turkey of the Ankara Protocol would create new momentum for the accession process and provide the opportunity to unblock a number of areas currently stalled. </p><p>  Foreign Minister Davotoğlu also briefed me on the Kurdish issue and talks with the PKK.  The government is optimistic, but cautious.  The announcement on 21 March that PKK leader Abdullah &Ouml;calan has called a ceasefire is most welcome and represents an opportunity to build on the ongoing talks towards a durable and democratic settlement.  These are very welcome developments and I took the opportunity to wish the Government well in its efforts. </p><p>  On 8 April I visited refugee camps for Syrians at Nizet near Gaziantep.  Turkey was the first neighbour of Syria to formally respond to the influx of Syrian refugees.  It maintains an open border policy for those fleeing the conflict and it has been praised for the level of humanitarian assistance it has provided.  I commended my interlocutors for the efforts of the Turkish people and on the occasion of my visit announced a further Irish contribution of &euro;1 million in humanitarian assistance for Syrians, specifically targeted for Turkey.  This comprises &euro;500,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross and &euro;500,000 to the UNHCR and it brings Irish assistance for the humanitarian crisis in Syria to &euro;8,150,000 to date.</p></reply>

The conference discussed a wide range of issues relating to ongoing efforts to consolidate lasting peace and stability in Somalia after twenty years of conflict and lawlessness.</p><p>  Significant progress has been made on consolidating peace and stability in Somalia, but continuing and immense challenges are faced by the new Government.</p><p>  In London last week, the Somali President, Ahmed Sheikh Mohamoud, and his Ministers presented to the international community their &lsquo;Six Pillar Policy&rsquo; &ndash; a plan which outlines immediate national priorities.  These were discussed and generally endorsed, and many participants at the Conference indicated ways in which they will provide support to Somalia in helping to deliver on these plans and targets.</p><p>  A significant focus of attention was on the security situation.  This is appropriate given the continuing threat from Al Shabaab terrorists which has been all too graphically illustrated by recent deadly and cowardly attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere.  Ireland is making an important contribution to efforts to improve the security situation in the country through providing the Commander and a significant contingent of personnel for the EU Training Mission in Somalia, which is building the capacity of the Somali National Security Forces to enable them to take over responsibility for security and law and order.</p><p>  There was also emphasis on the need for help in areas such as justice, policing, financial management and prevention of sexual violence.</p><p>  A Communiqu&eacute; was issued at the conclusion of the meeting which covers the issues discussed in detail.  I have arranged for a copy to be sent by my Department to the Deputy.</p><p>  In my intervention at the London conference, I stressed the need for continued attention to be paid to the humanitarian needs of those affected by the conflict, including internally displaced persons and refugees in neighbouring countries, notably Kenya.  Ireland has contributed more than &euro;41 million to efforts to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Somalia and the region, and we are committed to continuing to provide support and help in this area. </p><p>  We have also indicated, in the context of our new Policy on International Development, One World, One Future which we launched earlier this month, and which has a strengthened focus on fragile states, that Ireland will examine other opportunities for assisting Somalia&rsquo;s recovery in the period ahead.</p><p>  A further important international conference on Somalia, with particular focus on ways of supporting its economic and social development in the context of the Busan New Deal on Fragile States, will be hosted by the European Union in Brussels later this year. </p></reply>

The dimensions of the crisis are truly daunting.  An estimated 80,000 people have lost their lives; one-third of Syrians have either fled the country, are internally displaced or are otherwise in need of assistance; and there is an ever increasing threat to regional stability, as exemplified by the bomb explosion in Reyanhli in south Turkey on 12 May, which killed 46 people and injured hundreds.   </p><p>  Despite the level of destruction and violence, Ireland and its EU partners remain fully convinced that a political solution alone can bring about an end to the hostilities and lead the way towards a peaceful transition to democracy.</p><p>  Since his appointment in August 2012 and in extremely challenging circumstances, the UN/League of Arab States Special Envoy, Ladkhar Brahimi, has shown great resolve in working to achieve these objectives.  Ireland and its EU partners have expressed full support for his efforts, notably his search for a formula for transition based on last year&rsquo;s Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and providing for a transitional Government leading to free elections in Syria. </p><p>  The role of the international community in seeking a political settlement to the crisis, in particularly through the UN Security Council, is crucial.  I therefore warmly welcome the agreement reached by the US and Russia, following bilateral discussions in Moscow last week involving Secretary of State Kerry, President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov, to work together on an International Conference on Syria which would be held before the end of the month.  UN Secretary General Ban and Special Envoy Brahimi have also welcomed this development.  I urge the Syrian opposition to seize the opportunity offered by the US-Russia proposal and to engage fully in a process of dialogue aimed at ending the violence and starting a transition towards a genuine democratic dispensation in Syria. </p><p>  It also remains necessary to ensure that the many crimes and human rights abuses committed throughout the conflict do not go unpunished.  Ireland has been very much to the fore, both at the EU and international levels, in calling for all perpetrators to be held accountable for the war crimes and serious human rights violations they have committed, including through referral to the International Criminal Court.  Ireland has now agreed, along with 18 other EU member states, to co-sponsor a UN General Assembly resolution on Syria, due for adoption on 15 May, which addresses the current appalling situation in Syria and urges the need to ensure accountability.</p><p>  Ireland and the EU will remain fully occupied at all levels of our international engagement in securing the earliest cessation of violence in Syria and in providing the Syrian population with the aid and care they need and the hope that their nightmare will soon end.</p></reply>

Further information was conveyed separately at official level by the EAS and by E3 representatives.  Regrettably, the reports from Almaty all indicate that once again the Iranian side talked around the issues, engaging with some specifics but failing to address the key issues.  It would appear that once again the Iranian delegation was not authorised to engage in serious discussion or to work towards a compromise understanding and agreement.  If this continues to be the case, there will be no basis on which to sustain a credible political process.  This will no doubt be exploited by those who argue for a military solution to this issue, a position to which Ireland is strongly opposed.  I call on the Iranian authorities to reconsider their course of action and to show as a matter of urgency that they are willing to work towards a compromise diplomatic solution to this issue.</p></reply>

Ultimately, the contracts won and contacts made during trade missions lead to job creation and long-term economic benefits for Ireland.  </p><p>  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland Ministerial trade missions, organised with the active support of my Department&rsquo;s Embassy network and involving EI client companies, secured over &euro;200 million in new and additional contracts for Irish businesses.  Ultimately, the contracts won and contacts made during trade missions lead to job creation and long-term economic benefits for Ireland.  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland Ministerial trade missions, organised with the active support of my Department&rsquo;s Embassy network and involving EI client companies, secured over &euro;200 million in new and additional contracts for Irish businesses.  </p><p>  Trade promotion and economic messaging are, of course, key elements in many other Ministerial visits abroad and this was particularly so during the recent St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.  I travelled to Atlanta, New Orleans and Washington DC to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political interests in the US.  The centrepiece of my programme in Atlanta was an &lsquo;Invest in Ireland&rsquo; Business Leaders Forum organised by the IDA in conjunction with our Consulate General.  This event targeted both existing IDA clients and potential new investors.  I also held separate meetings with a number of major US and Irish companies operating in the Atlanta area.  The programme for New Orleans included further business networking, political and cultural events.  My programme for Washington DC included meetings with President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry, and a number of high level political meetings during which the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery were among the items discussed. </p><p>  Most recently, I undertook a four-day Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Turkey from 7 to 10 April, which was organised in close co-operation with my Department and the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara, during which contracts of over &euro;30 million were agreed.  During the mission, I held a range of meetings with prominent business people and business organisations in Ankara and Istanbul, including the Turkish Exporters Assembly (TIM) which signed a memorandum of understanding with the Irish Exporters Association.  In addition, I met with the President of Turkey, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for European Affairs, the Minister for the Economy, the Minister for Science and Technology and the Minister for Energy.  Government to Government contacts are highly valued in Turkey when doing business and such meetings provided vital support to Irish companies, in terms of establishing their credibility and gaining access to the business community at the appropriate levels. </p><p>  Looking forward to the second half of the year, I will continue to actively promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests overseas wherever possible, whether at targeted events and trade missions organised by Enterprise Ireland with the support of the Embassy network or in the course of broader bilateral visits. </p></reply>

This has included the provision by Ireland and other donors of predictable emergency response funding.  However, disasters on the scale of the earthquake in Haiti, the famine in the Horn of Africa and, more recently, the conflict in Syria continue to challenge the humanitarian system.  For such crises, international pledging conferences are often considered necessary in order to generate additional donor funding.</p><p>  Two months after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake, an international donor conference was held in New York, at which US $4.5 billion worth of assistance was pledged by the international community in response to the crisis.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2012, just $2.38 billion of this had actually been disbursed. For our part, we have worked hard to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitments to the people of Haiti. Ireland pledged &euro;13 million at the Haiti Donor Conference in March 2010 and, by the end of 2012, had honoured this commitment, with support totalling almost &euro;14 million.</p><p>  Similarly, at a Ministerial mini-summit in New York in September 2011, An T&aacute;naiste pledged that &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance would be made available to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the Horn of Africa before the end of 2012. I am happy to report that this pledge has also been met, with almost &euro;12 million in funding provided by December 2012. To date in 2013, I have approved almost &euro;6 million for continued humanitarian assistance to this region.</p><p>  Most recently, at the High-Level International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria in January 2013, I announced a commitment of &euro;4.7 million to support the provision of humanitarian assistance in Syria and its neighbouring countries. Since I made that pledge, Ireland has already surpassed our commitment, with funding of &euro;5.7 million having been provided to date this year.  Ireland, as one of the founding members of the Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD) initiative, takes seriously our commitment to act as a responsible and accountable donor. Equally, we are committed to the full implementation of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, which clearly articulates the EU and its Member States&rsquo; commitment to ensuring that humanitarian aid pledges are transformed into commitments and disbursements in a timely way, and are clearly linked to the assessment of needs.  As Presidency of the European Union during the first half of 2013, we will continue to press our fellow EU Member States to live up to their commitments under the Consensus.</p><p>  In order to promote the importance of ensuring that donor aid pledges are credible, achievable, and properly monitored, the OECD has published a &lsquo;Recommendation on Good Pledging Practice&rsquo;. This comprises a set of principles relating to pledging practice for financial undertakings to developing countries. The Recommendation is designed to serve as a benchmark to help OECD Member States frame future aid pledges in terms that are clear, practical, realistic, and capable of being monitored.  Ireland strongly supports this OECD initiative and will continue to use all appropriate fora to urge our fellow donors to ensure that they meet their humanitarian commitments in full.</p></reply>

I will also continue to urge all the parties in the Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland can be based.  Some of the contentious issues around parades, flags and identities have at their heart rights issues and a Bill of Rights is the key to dissolving the obstacles to progress on these issues.  As I said in a speech in Belfast last year &lsquo;Human rights and equality are fundamental to building a stable future for the island of Ireland. They are necessary for a solid, unshakeable, foundation for a lasting peace. A clear expression of these rights in a formal Bill of Rights can act as a touchstone.&rsquo;</p><p>  I believe that all parties in this house will share my frustration at the lack of progress on a Bill of Rights and I will continue to engage actively with the British government and the Northern Ireland Executive on this issue.</p></reply>

The report highlights how the continent should take advantage of this opportunity through a commodity-based industrialization strategy, leveraging Africa&rsquo;s abundant resources, high commodity prices, large youth populations and the changing global production process. </p><p>   These opportunities, and how Ireland can support them, are very much to the fore in the Government&rsquo;s recently launched Policy for International Development: One World, One Future. The Policy recognises the emergence of renewed confidence in developing countries, as they generate more of their own revenues, and open up further to the world. This is particularly true in Africa, which is and will remain the focus of the Government&rsquo;s official aid programme. Our aim, and the aim of our Key Partner Countries, is to reduce the dependency on aid and to empower governments and communities to address poverty and drive their own development. </p><p>  One of the three major goals in the Policy for International Development, therefore, is Sustainable Development and Inclusive Economic Growth. With this, we intend to increase our focus on trade and development and, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Africa Strategy, to better link development cooperation with the political and trade dimensions of our engagement in Africa. In doing so, we seek to contribute to increased trade and investment, private sector development, increased employment and enhanced human well-being.</p><p>  The Government very much welcomes the UN and African Union report. The implementation of industrial and other development policies to promote value addition and economic transformation and to reduce dependence on producing and exporting unprocessed commodities; the implementation of appropriate development planning frameworks and effective industrial policies; the removal of bottlenecks, the boosting of skills and capacity; and the promotion of regional and global integration, are all important recommendations from the report. If implemented, these recommendations will go a long way towards ensuring that Africa will no longer be a bystander to its own destiny addressing youth unemployment, poverty and gender disparities, and the other challenges faced by that continent.</p><p>  In our aid programme&rsquo;s engagement on economic growth, we too have a particular focus on those who are being left behind ensuring that development efforts target those most excluded, deliberately addressing the inequalities people face. Because if economic growth and industrialisation is to be sustained, it needs to be inclusive and it needs to tackle the root causes of poverty and vulnerability, thereby enabling developing countries to fully exploit their true potential and ensure development for all.  </p><p>  We are also very conscious of the fact that efficient and fair tax systems in developing countries are essential for sustainable growth, poverty reduction and the provision of basic services. Tax avoidance and evasion present a major issue for developing countries seeking to drive their own development. Ireland is playing a strong role in global efforts to increase revenue generation and tackle tax avoidance and evasion in developing countries. The brokering by Ireland of an agreement in the EU for the revision of the EU transparency and accounting directives, which when passed into legislation will improve transparency among EU multinational companies involved in extractive and logging industries in developing countries, is one recent example of this.</p><p>  Over the coming years, as we implement Ireland&rsquo;s new Policy for International Development, we look forward to partnering with African Government&rsquo;s to deliver on the economic and trade opportunities identified in the very timely report by the UN Economic Commission for Africa and the African Union.</p></reply>

The Government has been engaged intensively with colleagues to meet these challenges and to get to grips with the consequences.  At the core of this were the steps taken to underpin the security of and confidence in the euro. Mechanisms to provide support to Member States were put in place - initially on a temporary footing &ndash; the EFSF and the EFSM; subsequently a permanent support mechanism in the form of the ESM.</p><p>  Economic governance was significantly strengthened, including through the legislative &ldquo;six-pack&rdquo; and &ldquo;two pack&rdquo;, the latter agreed under our Presidency; the European Semester process; and the Stability Treaty.  We are in the process of examining steps that we need to take to further strengthen Economic and Monetary Union, and are agreed that a significant means of doing this is through a more integrated financial framework, or banking union. Last December, the European Council set an ambitious timetable for this work, and, as Presidency, we are working hard to ensure that commitments are fulfilled and deadlines met.</p><p>  In March, the Irish Presidency reached provisional agreement with the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). At the Informal ECOFIN meeting in Dublin, political agreement on the SSM was reached and the texts were legally adopted by Coreper on 18 April. We also secured agreement on the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV), will see the risk profile of the European banking system reduced over time.</p><p>  It clear, however, that unemployment, especially among the young, remains a very real challenge that must be met. In this regard, I very much welcome the commitment to a dedicated &euro;6 billion to this task as part of the new Financial Framework on which the Government is seeking to reach agreement with the Parliament. As Presidency, we have also secured agreement on the youth guarantee which will ensure that every person under 25 without a job receives a meaningful offer of work, training or education.</p><p>  We also need to focus our attention on generating growth. The Commission&rsquo;s forecasts for the Union are not encouraging and we need to deploy every tool at our disposal. The European Council adopted the Compact for Jobs and Growth in June last year. As Presidency, we are working with partners to ensure that it is delivered.</p><p>  There can be no doubt that the crisis has placed considerable economic and social strain on people across the Union, and that this has been reflected in political outcomes in some Member States. This is something that we cannot ignore, and that must drive us to redouble our efforts to ensure economic recovery and the return of confidence.  The Government will continue to insist that Europe&rsquo;s future must be built on the values that have served it so well to date, including solidarity, unity of purpose and mutual respect.</p></reply>

They also featured in the joint meeting which the Secretary of State and I had with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s First Minister Peter Robinson and with the Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness later that day at Stormont Castle. I underlined our view that it is essential that the determinations of the Parades Commission are fully respected and that the Parades Commission and the Police Service of Northern Ireland receive full support from everyone. I am concerned at reports that the Police face a very challenging situation this marching season and that the rule of law will be tested, in similar ways to the recent illegal street protests.

I fully understand the disappointment expressed by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan M&eacute;ndez, in relation to the decision taken by the Government of Bahrain to postpone his visit to the country, which was scheduled to take place from 8 to 15 May 2013.  According to the Special Rapporteur, this is the second time that his visit has been postponed at very short notice.</p><p>  The Bahrain Government has stated that the proposed visit could be damaging to the ongoing National Dialogue process taking place between the Government and opposition parties.  However, I believe that his visit would in fact have been timely given the ongoing concerns which have been expressed in relation to the possible ill-treatment of prisoners in Bahrain.  An independent assessment of the situation would have contributed positively to the National Dialogue process and strengthened trust among the parties that the Government is truly committed to taking steps to promote a culture of transparency and respect for human rights in Bahrain.</p><p>  In this case and in all others, Ireland strongly supports the office of the Special Rapporteur on torture and maintains that the independent mandate of his office must be fully respected by all countries.  We believe that the Government of Bahrain should honour the commitments made to the United Nations Universal Periodic Review process in September 2012, among which was the acceptance of a recommendation to welcome a visit by the Special Rapporteur.</p><p>  The US State Department&rsquo;s 2012 country report on Bahrain, released in April of this year, is a useful and detailed contribution to the international community&rsquo;s assessment of the human rights environment within that country.  The report outlines a number of very serious concerns reported in 2012, including allegations of torture in both official government detention centres and unofficial sites.  It also details the lack of due process in trials of political and human rights activists, with some resulting in harsh sentences.</p><p>  Arbitrary arrest is also one of the issues outlined in the State Department report and in this context the arrest of human rights defender, Mr. Naji Fateel, at his home in north-west Bahrain on 2 May, is of serious concern.  Mr. Fateel is a board member of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, and a blogger who has been active in reporting human rights violations in Bahrain.  Mr. Fateel attended the Front Line Defenders 2010 Dublin Platform.  According to the latest reports received, on 5 May he was transferred to the Dry Dock prison in Bahrain.  It is alleged that he is suffering from several injuries received due to torture while he was in detention.  On 9 May, he was charged with the establishment of a group for the purpose of disabling the constitution under article 6 of the Terrorism Act.  The prosecutor has ordered sixty days further imprisonment pending investigation.  I call on the Bahrain government to ensure Mr. Fateel&rsquo;s human rights are fully respected during his detention.</p><p>  I have repeatedly called on the Government of Bahrain to demonstrate its commitment to upholding human rights and to implement in full the recommendations of the Bahraini International Commission of Inquiry.  I have ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on human rights issues in Bahrain have been conveyed regularly to the Bahraini authorities and I will continue to do so.   Officials in my Department make clear our concerns to the Bahraini Ambassador in London as required; and Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Riyadh, who is accredited to Bahrain, has raised human rights issues directly with the authorities there on every appropriate occasion, including most recently with the Foreign Minister while the Ambassador was in Bahrain over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.</p><p>  At EU level, High Representative Ashton and senior EU officials have regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities the EU&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.  I fully support the High Representative&rsquo;s readiness to provide, if requested, EU support for the resumed national dialogue process.</p></reply>

Ireland has consistently been one of the WFP&rsquo;s most generous donors and key partners, being the twenty-fourth highest contributor of 133 donors from 2009 to date.  Ireland&rsquo;s total support to WFP in 2012 amounted to approximately &euro;14 million. Of this, just under &euro;10 million was provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with the remainder being provided for specific humanitarian emergencies by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Irish Aid programme. In 2012, Irish Aid funding was provided for WFP&rsquo;s emergency activities in Chad, Syria and the Sahel, as well as for the operation of the UN Humanitarian Air Service, which is managed by the WFP.</p><p>  The Strategic Partnership Agreement with the WFP is a non-legally binding statement of mutual commitment to shared principles and strategic objectives in addressing the issue of global food insecurity. Through the Agreement, the Government has committed itself to supporting WFP in order to reduce hunger and under-nutrition, save lives and livelihoods in humanitarian emergencies, and strengthen the capacity of countries to invest in disaster preparedness and prevention.</p><p>  Under the Agreement, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has committed to the provision of an annual contribution of &euro;7 million to the WFP over a three-year period. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Irish Aid programme, also provides the WFP with additional contributions on the basis of humanitarian need. Under this Agreement, we will continue to consider additional contributions on a case-by-case basis, in view of humanitarian needs identified and funding available.</p><p>  In this context, to date this year, I have already approved &euro;2.25 million in humanitarian funding for the WFP this year. This includes contributions to the WFP&rsquo;s emergency food assistance programmes in Syria and Mali, as well as the global operations of the UN Humanitarian Air Service.</p></reply>

We have consistently supported for some time the proposal that there should be a specific human rights monitoring and reporting element forming part of the MINURSO mandate.  This would allow MINURSO to report on the human rights situation not only within Western Sahara itself but also within the refugee camps situated in Tindouf, Algeria.  I therefore very much welcomed the fact that, in his most recent report to the Security Council on the mission, Secretary-General Ban drew attention to the need for &#8220;independent, impartial, comprehensive and sustained monitoring of the human rights situations in both Western Sahara and the [refugee] camps&#8221;.</p><p>  I understand that Secretary General Ban's report and recommendations were extensively discussed within the Security Council prior to the adoption of Resolution 2099 last month which extended MINURSO's mandate for a further 12 months.  I regret that it did not prove possible on this occasion for the members of Security Council to agree to include a specific human rights monitoring element within the MINURSO mandate, in response to the Secretary General's clear encouragement for such a provision.  I would hope that renewed consideration can be given to the inclusion of such a human rights component when the MINURSO mandate next comes up for renewal.</p></reply>

However, positive development results and respect for human rights must go hand in hand.  Ireland remains strongly committed to helping build good governance and the rights of the most vulnerable in Tanzania and elsewhere.

There are in excess of 6.8 million Syrians requiring immediate assistance inside the country, over 4million of whom have been internally displaced. Widespread and indiscriminate violence has resulted in an estimated 80,000 deaths and has forced whole communities to flee for sanctuary in neighbouring countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Many thousands more are gathering in border areas inside Syria planning risky crossings as the civil war continues to claim more lives.    The latest figures from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, indicate that almost 1.5 million refugees have now been forced to leave Syria, almost half of whom are children. As the influx continues, Governments and host populations across the region are facing serious strains on their health and education systems, housing and other services. Over three quarters of all refugees are living amongst host communities and the continuing ability of these communities to support new arrivals is limited. My own visit to al-Zaatari refugee camp in northern Jordan in 2012 and the T&aacute;naiste's visit to Nizip refugee camp in southern Turkey in April this year highlighted the extent of the humanitarian challenge and the dangers posed to international peace and security by this continuing crisis. </p><p>  As the Deputy notes, the unfolding conflict has the potential to have a significant impact on the situation in Lebanon, as a neighbouring country with close links to Syria and a history of political instability and conflict. The EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 22 April, which the T&aacute;naiste attended, looked at how the EU could enhance its support to Lebanon in order to avoid its fragile stability being further undermined. Together with our European partners, we will continue to support Prime Minister Salam and his Government as they respond to the refugee influx and work<b></b>  to prevent sectarian violence and civil conflict being triggered in Lebanon as a result of the Syrian situation.</p><p>  Ireland has responded generously to the crisis in Syria and its neighbouring countries, and to date has provided over &euro;8.15 million in assistance through partners such as WFP, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). A significant proportion of this support has also been allocated to the UNHCR which is leading the international response to the refugee crisis through the Regional Refugee Response Plan. However, this UN supported plan has only received approximately 55% of the US$1 billion requested to meet the needs of the burgeoning refugee population. It is somewhat disappointing that commitments made by the international community to assist these vulnerable groups remain unfulfilled and we are doing all we can to ensure that other States follow our example in meeting such promises in full and without delay. </p><p>  The Government will remain in close contact with its Embassies in the region, UN agencies and NGO partners on the ground to closely monitor the ongoing situation in Syria and its neighbouring countries. We stand ready to consider further support in light of our own resources and in consultation with our partners on the ground. We will remain fully supportive of all efforts to promote the earliest possible political settlement, and of efforts to ensure full accountability for the many war crimes and human rights violations committed since the conflict erupted. </p></reply>

I discussed this issue with Hillary Clinton when she was US Secretary of State.  It is also mentioned regularly in discussions between Irish and US officials and between the EU and the US.   I am conscious that his efforts to do so have to date been frustrated by the absence of the necessary agreement on the part of the US Congress. I welcome the President&rsquo;s continuing political commitment to close Guantanamo, including a recent statement he made on this issue. I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to press for urgent closure of the detention centre.   As regards the current hunger strike at Guantanamo, my Department is monitoring developments closely.   I hope that the immediate situation will be handled on a basis which ensures full respect for the human rights of the detainees and which avoids loss of life.

The scale of the challenge of fighting global poverty and providing nutritious food for a growing population, in the context of a changing climate, was highlighted at the international Conference on Hunger Nutrition and Climate Justice which we organised in Dublin last month.  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, takes the lead on Government policy in relation to biofuels and EU policy on biofuels, including the European Commission's proposal to limit the use of crop-based biofuels in transport to 5% by 2020.</p><p>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive of 2009 requires that, by 2020, 10% of transport fuels should come from renewable sources.  The Directive also provided that the ongoing effects of its implementation be monitored by the European Commission.  Following a number of studies on the Directive's effects, in October 2012 the Commission published a proposal to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive.  The Commission included a proposal that the 10% quota be reduced to 5%.  The proposal for a reduction to 5%, in conjunction with the incentives for advanced (next-generation) biofuels, signals the desire of the Commission to move towards the use of advanced biofuels made from feedstocks which do not compete with the production of food.</p><p>  While Member States agree that the issue must be addressed, it is an extremely complex matter, and there is no agreement yet on the appropriateness of a 5% cap.  The issue is currently being progressed at an ad hoc working group of the EU Energy and Environment Councils, with the objective of producing a progress report for the meetings of the Energy and Environment Councils in June 2013.   The fight to end extreme hunger is, and will remain, a key priority for Ireland's international development programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We take a comprehensive approach in addressing the issue of hunger, including issues of good governance in respect of land use.</p><p>  In the context of its G8 Presidency, the British Government is co-organising an important international meeting on hunger and nutrition in London on 8 June, on the theme 'Nutrition for Growth: Beating Hunger through Business and Science'<b>.</b>  Ireland is a core partner in this initiative and the Taoiseach will participate, at the invitation of the British Prime Minister.  The event will build on the Olympic Hunger Summit held at Downing Street in August 2012, which the Taoiseach also attended.  The forthcoming event in London will focus specifically on under-nutrition, an often silent element of hunger which has devastating consequences.  Over 40% of children under the age of five in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are undernourished, putting them at greater risk of infection and death, and seriously limiting their ability to reach their full potential in school and in their countries and communities.  I am determined that Ireland will continue our strong international advocacy and action to address hunger and undernutrition.  In London, we will focus particularly on supporting efforts to harness public and private investment which will assist low income countries to address the challenge of undernutrition.</p></reply>

I share the concern of Ireland's UN and EU partners regarding the current state of labour conditions in Bangladesh.  Ireland's commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights is a fundamental feature of our foreign policy.  Under Ireland's new policy for International Development - One World, One Future, we are committed to ensuring that economic development is compatible with human rights, including the right to decent work.  Our engagement in this area will be informed by, among other international standards, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, Irish Aid currently provides assistance to International Labour Organisation's (ILO) <i>'Decent Work Agenda'</i>   through a partnership programme that covers the four year period 2012-2015.</p><p>  In a statement issued on 30 April by High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton, and Commissioner for Trade, Karl de Gucht, the EU called upon the authorities in Bangladesh to act immediately to ensure that factories across the country comply with international labour standards including International Labour Organisations (ILO) conventions.  On 29 April 2013, Bangladesh underwent a 'Universal Periodic Review' of the human rights situation in the country.  During this review Ireland recommended that Bangladesh ensure widespread, unannounced and rigorous factory inspections.  Where breaches in Bangladesh's Labour Act (2006) occur, those responsible should be held accountable in a manner sufficient to ensure deterrence.  Ireland's recommendations were accepted by Bangladesh.</p><p>  I welcome recent efforts by the Government of Bangladesh to reform labour laws in response to this tragedy and urge that further reforms, as recommended in the Universal Periodic Review, are implemented without delay.  Ireland, as a member of the EU, is willing to assist the authorities in Bangladesh to meet international standards and will continue to urge European and international companies operating in Bangladesh to follow internationally recognised Corporate Social Responsibility Guidelines and promote better health and safety standards.</p></reply>

Other issues we discussed included the current situation in Syria; Northern Ireland and the challenges of building a reconciled and shared society for all communities; development issues and the recent Hunger, Nutrition and Climate Change Conference that Mary Robinson and I co-hosted; and the Great Lakes Region (as Mary Robinson was recently appointed as UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa).

In addition, many consumers would wish to be able to distinguish between produce from Israel, from Palestinian producers, and from Israeli settlements, and to make their own decisions as to what they wish to purchase.  Indeed, I believe that some consumers may be avoiding produce from Israel because at present they are not confident that this does not include settlement goods.  A move to distinguish goods from settlements would also send a strong political signal regarding the highly damaging impact of continuing settlement expansion.

Indeed, I believe that some consumers may be avoiding produce from Israel because at present they are not confident that this does not include settlement goods. A move to distinguish goods from settlements would also send a strong political signal regarding the highly damaging impact of continuing settlement expansion.</p><p>  In February EU High Representative Ashton wrote to Foreign Ministers, and committed herself to preparing EU-wide guidelines that would strengthen implementation of EU consumer legislation and ensure its consistency with EU foreign policy objectives. Along with twelve of my EU colleagues I wrote back to her to commend this action and offer our full support.  Work is now ongoing at official level in the EU, at this stage primarily between the EAS and the Commission, and it is expected that the EU will develop guidelines on place of origin labelling for products from settlements entering the EU market which ensure that consumers can be fully informed about the origin of such products.</p><p>  Domestically, I have written to a number of Ministers whose responsibilities have a bearing on the labelling issue, so that we can feed in properly to the consideration at EU level. In due course, if satisfactory action at EU level is not possible, I will discuss with those Ministers the possibility of issuing national guidelines to the same effect. Clearly however a solution at EU level would be better.  Separately, I have stated that Ireland could support a ban at EU level on settlement products entering the EU market at all, but that this is not a practical prospect for the moment.  I have elaborated on this aspect in earlier responses to Deputies.  Finally, it is important also to clarify that these actions relate solely to products of illegal Israeli settlements. I am not considering, and do not support, any action against products from Israel itself.</p></reply>

Since his appointment in August 2012, the UN/League of Arab States Special Envoy Ladkhar Brahimi has shown great resolve in working to achieve these objectives.  The international community has consistently expressed its full support for his efforts, notably his search for a formula for transition based on last year&rsquo;s Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and providing for a transitional Government leading to free elections in Syria.</p><p>  The role of the international community in seeking a political settlement to the crisis, in particular through the UN Security Council, remains essential.  I therefore warmly welcome the agreement reached by the US and Russia on 7 May to host an International Conference on Syria which would be held before the end of the month.  UN Secretary General Ban and Special Envoy Brahimi have also welcomed this development.  I urge both sides to the conflict to seize the opportunity offered by the US-Russia proposal and to engage fully in a process of dialogue aimed at ending the violence and starting a transition towards a genuine democratic dispensation in Syria.</p><p>  It remains essential not to lose sight of the dreadful humanitarian crisis that is unfolding as a result of the conflict in Syria; we are now faced with a truly alarming situation, with almost 1.5 million refugees and over 6.8 million within Syria in need of assistance.  I was able myself to witness the impact of this appalling conflict on ordinary civilians and children when I visited a refugee camp at Nizip on the Turkish-Syrian border in early April.  The crisis is placing particular pressure on neighbouring countries which are required to host large numbers of refugees.  It is important that the international community continues to provide financial and political support to these countries in order to prevent a further deterioration of the humanitarian and security situation.</p><p>  In response to the various calls for support and help, Ireland has generously contributed more than &euro;8 million to this humanitarian crisis, including a &euro;1 million contribution to the UN-led humanitarian effort which I announced during my recent visit to Turkey.  Total EU assistance to date currently stands at well in excess of &euro;600 million.  Ireland will continue to take an active role at all levels of our engagement in working to bring about the earliest possible cessation of violence in Syria and ensuring that all those in need, in or outside Syria, can be given the aid they require.</p></reply>

After decades of war, instability and poor governance the humanitarian needs facing the country are enormous.  Ongoing conflict, human rights violations and gender-based violence in the east of the country continue to displace hundreds of thousands of people internally and across borders into Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda.  The challenges facing the DRC require the support of the international community not just in terms of traditional humanitarian interventions but also longer term strategies which aim to build the lasting capacity and increase the ability of communities to withstand future shocks.  Furthermore, the situation demands the attention and political support of the United Nations and regional actors.</p><p>  In this regard, I have in recent weeks voiced Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the appointment by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of Mary Robinson as his Special Envoy to oversee the implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement and the leadership offered by the United Nation in this renewed effort to break the cycle of violence in eastern DRC.  I also recognise the constructive role the European Union is playing in the region.  The EU is working through political and diplomatic engagement and development cooperation programmes, in support of implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement and the strengthening of the UN peace-keeping force MONUSCO.  The European Commission (DG ECHO) provided almost &euro;61 million in humanitarian aid to DRC in 2012, with a further &euro;12.7 million provided to the Great Lakes region and in support of Congolese refugees.  Current plans foresee at least &euro;54 million being provided in 2013.  As Presidency of the European Union, Ireland has consistently worked to ensure a strong EU position on the DRC and to highlight the need for humanitarian organisations in eastern DRC to have access to those displaced and in need of assistance.</p><p>  Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to the DRC.  In 2012 alone, Ireland provided over &euro;10 million in emergency and longer-term development funding to the country.  Some &euro;6.9 million of this funding was allocated to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) for DRC, a UN-administered fund which is allocated to projects by the resident UN Humanitarian Coordinator, with an additional &euro;3 million provided to Christian Aid, Concern, Tr&oacute;caire and Oxfam.  So far in 2013, Ireland has provided &euro;3.8 million in funding, with much of this directed at the provision of emergency food, water, health and protection to vulnerable groups in eastern DRC.</p><p>  In addition to this direct humanitarian assistance and our work as EU Presidency, Ireland also continues to monitor the human rights situation in the DRC closely and will continue to use our membership of the Human Rights Council to raise issues of concern with regards human rights abuses and violations as appropriate.  In this regard, we look forward to raising these issues when the Human Rights Council next discusses DRC in September 2013.</p></reply>

It will have consequences for us all in the EU &ndash; most of all for the United Kingdom which must be allowed to reach the decision that it deems best for its own interests, but also for other Member States, especially Ireland, depending on how events unfold.  Not only do I believe that this is the best outcome for Ireland; but I also believe that it is the best outcome for the UK and for the wider European Union.  While many have commented in and on the debate underway, the question has not arisen in a formal way in the European Union.</p><p>  The Treaty of Lisbon for the first time included a provision &ndash; Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union &ndash; which explicitly provides for circumstances in which a Member State might seek to withdraw from the Union, and which sets out the procedures that would be followed in such a case.  While the provision is a new one, it was always considered implicit in the Treaties, the Union has never been one of duress.  It is only when a Member State makes such an application that the issue would fall for formal consideration.</p><p>  Article 50 has not been invoked to date, and I very much hope that this will remain the case.  Both nationally, and as Presidency, the Government&rsquo;s priority is ensuring that the Union is properly equipped to deal with the complex and exceptional economic challenges that confront the Union.  We will continue to work with like-minded partners, including the UK, to achieve the Union our citizens want &ndash; a recovered Union back to the path of economic growth and job creation; and based on the values that have served it will, including solidarity, democracy and mutual respect.</p></reply>

In the latest joint communiqu&eacute; from the peace talks in Havana, published on 3rd May, the delegations noted progress achieved on a number of areas under discussion and also reiterated their appreciation to Cuba, Norway, Venezuela and Chile.  These countries are, at the request of the parties to the talks, playing a helpful role as facilitators to the process.  The European Union continues to follow closely the progress of negotiations, and has declared its readiness to provide support for activities that promote peace, truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation.</p><p>  Ireland supports fully this approach, and stands ready within available means to share our experiences, if invited to do so by the parties to the process.  I had the opportunity to meet with Colombia&rsquo;s President Santos last January on the margins of the EU-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean countries) Summit in Chile and I assured him of Ireland&rsquo;s support for the negotiations.  President Santos told me of his interest in our own peace process and said that the Colombian process has already incorporated some useful lessons from it.  In the course of our conversation, we spoke also of the visit to Colombia by the delegation from Northern Ireland last year and President Santos recalled the useful discussions that had taken place during that visit.  I told President Santos that Ireland understands very well the challenges as well as the opportunities represented by this peace process and I expressed the hope that a successful outcome can be reached in the talks underway.</p></reply>

Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world.  We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world.  We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.  The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements.  The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council.  The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments.  Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance.  Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011.  The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it.  We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.</p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training).  Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported.  Irish Aid, the aid programme operated by my Department, has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

The statement also encouraged the Ukrainian authorities to work closely with the European Parliament&rsquo;s monitoring mission to Ukraine headed by former president of the European Parliament Cox and former president of Poland Kwaśniewski with a view to redressing the effects of the current situation and removing outstanding concerns regarding selective justice in Ukraine.  I fully support this statement.  The EU maintains its position, as set out in the Conclusions of the 10 December 2012 Foreign Affairs Council and in the joint statement of the EU-Ukraine Summit of 25 February 2013, that Ukraine must address the issue of &lsquo;selective justice&rsquo; in a determined manner.  In this context, the release last month of former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko and another imprisoned former Minister represents an important step by the Ukrainian authorities towards addressing the concern about selective justice that the EU has repeatedly expressed.  Ukraine must address this issue convincingly if progress is to be made towards signature of the Association Agreement at the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius in November.  We would very much like to see further steps taken that would make signature of the Association Agreement possible.</p></reply>

Enlargement is a conditional process: prospective member states must themselves achieve progress on reforms in order to move forward on their EU paths.  There have been a number of developments in enlargement policy during our Presidency.  It is hoped this development may lead to Council decisions in June on the opening of accession negotiations with Serbia and the opening of negotiations of Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations with Kosovo.  However, progress on the implementation of the Belgrade Pristina Dialogue Agreement will be important between now and June.  The Commission also published its report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in April.  It was relatively positive on reforms, good neighbourly relations and on efforts regarding the &lsquo;name issue&rsquo; with Greece.  However it also noted the negative effects of two months of political crisis following events on 24 December 2012, which resulted in the forcible removal of opposition MPs from Parliament.  It remains to be seen whether enough progress has been achieved for the Council to agree to open accession negotiations.  The Irish Presidency stands ready to facilitate this, should the Council so decide.</p><p>  The final Commission monitoring report on Croatia, issued on 26 March, was positive.  Ratifications of the Croatian Accession Treaty by Member States are on track, and we expect to see Croatia accede to the European Union as planned on 1 July.  We are hopeful of being able to open a negotiation Chapter (Chapter 22 on Regional policy) with Turkey during our Presidency.  However, this will depend on the efforts of Turkey and the EU Member States to facilitate progress.</p><p>  Negotiations with Montenegro are at an early stage.  A Chapter was opened last month and we may be able open another in June.  We are also working to progress the important Rule of Law Chapters (23 and 24), which are central to the pace of Montenegro&rsquo;s accession process.</p><p>  Iceland is already well advanced in the accession negotiations.  The previous Icelandic government took a decision to slow down the accession negotiations ahead of elections on 27 April.  At present negotiations are underway to form a new coalition.  Until they are concluded it is not known for certain what way the negotiations with Iceland will proceed.</p><p>  For Albania, the Council stands ready to consider granting official candidate status when the Commission reports that necessary progress has been achieved.  However progress has been limited in recent months in the run up to elections in June, and so we would not anticipate a Council decision on Albania during our Presidency.</p><p>  Bosnia and Herzegovina is now lagging behind its neighbours on reforms, and this is an issue of real concern.  The Bosnian government and political leaders must make real and sustained progress in order to realise the country&rsquo;s EU perspective.  What is required is clearly laid out in the December Council Conclusions, and in the June 2012 roadmap agreed by the Commission and Bosnia and Herzegovina&rsquo;s leaders.</p></reply>

It addresses all dimensions on the different crises in the region including conflict, underdevelopment, and issues related to governance and human rights.</p><p>  The EU is also implementing significant humanitarian and recovery programmes to respond to the food security crisis and the impact of conflict in the region, including its 'Supporting the Horn of Africa's Resilience' (SHARE) initiative, which was born out of the 2011 Horn of Africa food crisis, and  which aims to promote resilience for vulnerable communities in the region.</p><p>  The situation in Somalia continues to be a major focus of international attention.  I represented Ireland at the Somalia Conference in London on 7 May which was attended by representatives of more than 50 countries and international organisations.  The Conference discussed a wide range of issues relating to ongoing efforts to consolidate lasting peace and stability in Somalia after twenty years of conflict and lawlessness.</p><p>  Ireland is making an important contribution to efforts to improve the security situation in Somalia through providing the Commander and a significant contingent of personnel for the EU Training Mission in Somalia, which is building the capacity of the Somali National Security Forces to enable them to take over responsibility for security and law and order.  Ireland has contributed more than &euro;41 million to efforts to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Somalia and the region, and we are committed to continuing to provide support and help in this area.  We have also indicated, in the context of our new Policy on International Development, &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo;, which we launched earlier this month, and which has a strengthened focus on fragile states, that Ireland will examine other opportunities for assisting Somalia&rsquo;s recovery in the period ahead.  A further important international Conference on Somalia, with particular focus on ways of supporting its economic and social development in the context of the Busan New Deal on Fragile States, will be hosted by the European Union in Brussels later this year. </p></reply>

The involvement of child soldiers has been reported in most recent armed conflicts and in almost every region of the world over the last two decades.  Each year, the United Nations Secretary-General issues a report on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups - both state and non-state - that recruit and use children.  The most recent list includes 52 state and non-state armed groups operating across three continents.  It is estimated that up to 300,000 children continue to be involved in more than 30 conflicts worldwide, including, notably, in a number of internal and regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>  Against this background, international legal efforts to curb the practice of using children in armed conflict have been stepped up significantly.  In 1996, the UN General Assembly voted to establish the post of Special-Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict<b>,</b> tasked to serve as an independent advocate for the protection and well-being of boys and girls affected by armed conflict.  In 1999, the UN<b></b>Security Council passed its first Resolution highlighting the impact of armed conflict on children and condemning violations carried out in that context.  With the adoption of nine Resolutions and several Presidential statements since then, the Security Council has developed important tools to strengthen child protection and to promote compliance with international standards.</p><p>  The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC) was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 May 2000 and entered into force in 2002.  It is considered the core international human rights treaty on child soldiers: It lays out clear standards relating to the recruitment and use of under-18s by state armed forces as well as non-state armed groups which, if fully implemented, provide a strong foundation for long-term prevention of unlawful recruitment and use of children, and for assisting those who have already became involved in armed conflict.</p><p>  Ireland has engaged on this issue in various ways including, crucially, through the core work of our aid programme in addressing poverty and under-development - major root causes of this problem.  Ireland has also supported more targeted and specific interventions from supporting agencies such as UNICEF and the International Criminal Court, to designing interventions in our bilateral programmes that address the needs of children affected by conflict.</p><p>  We remain deeply committed to addressing this issue, as has been recently reflected in Ireland's new Policy for International Development, 'One World, One Future', where we have pledged to increase our engagement on the issue of child soldiers and children in armed conflict.  We are actively examining options for strengthened action in this area.  We are also actively exploring ways in which we can use our membership at the UN Human Rights Council to support ongoing international efforts on this important issue.</p></reply>

In our new Policy for International Development: One World, One Future, in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments to Public Service Reform, we renew our strong focus on openness, transparency and accountability.  All programmes considered for funding assistance are rigorously appraised using clear criteria, including efficiency in the use of resources, cost effectiveness and sustainability of intended impact.  All partners in receipt of aid funds are obligated to report regularly on the results being achieved as a consequence of this support.  At the most fundamental level our aid must make a real difference in the lives of the poor and must assist in building essential service delivery systems and capacity for the future.</p><p>  We work closely with the UN and EU in conducting joint appraisals, ensuring clear and measurable targets for our aid are agreed and that the achievement of these is monitored in a systematic and transparent manner.  Programmes in receipt of funding through the Irish Aid programme are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that the intended objectives and goals are being achieved.  They are evaluated and audited by independent experts as well as by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit.  The Unit&rsquo;s work is regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of my Department.</p><p>  I believe that our &lsquo;zero tolerance&rsquo; for any misuse or misappropriation of aid funding is recognised and respected. In the event of any fraudulent use of Irish Aid funding, such as happened last year in Uganda, it is our policy to demand a full refund of monies disbursed and to pursue the perpetrators through the police and court system.</p></reply>

The Government have also attached great importance to providing for future flows of migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the so called E3 visa scheme to include Irish citizens.</p><p>  In this context, we very much welcome the publication last month of the US Senate's <i>Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill</i> which provides for reform of the US immigration system.  </p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bipartisan group of eight US Senators, includes provisions that would legalise the status of thousands of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US. </p><p>  The Bill is a very positive development.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  </p><p>  Both of these issues were a key focus of the ongoing contacts undertaken by the Taoiseach and me with political leaders in the US, particularly during our visit to Washington D.C. over St. Patrick's Day when we discussed the prospects for progress with Ireland's key friends on Capitol Hill and in the Administration.  The Government has maintained close contact since publication of the Bill with the key players through our Embassy in Washington.   </p><p>  It is important to recall that the overall issues involved are complex and sensitive ones within the US political system and that much further debate is likely to be required before the final shape of any overall legislation becomes clear. </p><p>  I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the active support we continue to receive from a number of Irish community organisations, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts and the Ancient Order of Hibernians.</p></reply>

During its first four and a half months in office, steady progress has been made on the Presidency&rsquo;s policy objectives.  In the remaining seven weeks of the Presidency the Government will further intensify its efforts to drive its Presidency programme forward and to deliver strong and tangible results for the EU and its citizens.  We were pleased to have secured agreement in February on the Youth Guarantee programme.  The decision reached at the February European Council on a &euro;6bn fund to tackle youth unemployment in the worst-affected regions in the EU was also significant.  The Presidency will continue to  make progress on initiatives such as the Erasmus for All programme aimed at ensuring that all citizens, but particularly young people, have access to the skills and education to equip them for today&rsquo;s job market.  As Presidency, Ireland also identified the research and innovation sector as an area with strong growth potential and we are working hard on initiatives such as the Horizon 2020 funding programme and the European Research Area to support future growth and employment in this fast-growing sector.

The Irish Presidency also placed a strong emphasis on measures aimed at strengthening and modernising the Single Market to deliver growth and job creation.  The agreement secured on the Accounting Directive and the Union Customs Code will contribute to reducing the administrative burden on businesses, in particular SMEs.  The Re-Use of Public Sector Information agreement that the Presidency brokered in April also offers strong potential to spur growth and support the creation of new jobs in Europe.  The Unified Patent Court (UPC) agreement will not just help business by providing a one-stop shop for registering and protecting patents within the EU, but will also contribute to driving growth in the digital Single Market.  Our ongoing work in driving forward policy on key issues including e-identification regulation and the data protection package is proceeding well.  The Presidency will host the Digital Agenda Assembly in Dublin in June which we hope will contribute to the development of this critical sector of the Irish and European economies.</p><p>  The Irish Presidency is also working to advance the EU&rsquo;s external trade agenda with third countries in order to open new markets for Europe&rsquo;s exporters and to create jobs.  Good progress is being made in trade negotiations with a number of countries in Asia.  One of our top priorities in the trade area remains securing a mandate for the start of negotiations on a Trade and Investment Partnership with the US given the very great potential for growth and job creation that such an agreement could generate on both sides of the Atlantic.  This will remain a key focus for the remainder of the Presidency.  </p><p>  The Irish Presidency is also attaching major importance to measures which promote stability and confidence in Europe&rsquo;s economy.  In parallel with its focus on growth and jobs, we have placed a strong emphasis on restoring health to the EU&rsquo;s banking system to support future growth, protect tax-payers and avoid past mistakes.  Good progress has been made on advancing the Banking Union package of legislation, with agreements secured by the Presidency on the Capital Requirements Directive IV and Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We are now working on other elements of the Banking Union, in particular the Banking Resolution and Recovery proposal.  The Presidency has also secured agreement in other areas including on proposals such as the Mortgage Credit Directive and the &ldquo;Two Pack&rdquo; legislation which improves budgetary surveillance and coordination in the euro area.</p><p>  Following the decision taken at the European Council last February on the EU&rsquo;s future financing, the Taoiseach and I have met on a number of occasions with the President of the European Parliament (EP) to address the issues preventing the Parliament from giving its approval to the proposed Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014 to 2020.  Ireland considers that timely agreement on the budget is critical given the implications for EU initiatives which support the creation of employment, economic growth and social cohesion in Europe.  The Taoiseach and I met EP President Schulz and Commission President Barroso in Brussels on 6 May, and I am pleased that our discussions formed the basis of further negotiations on resolving outstanding differences which I attended earlier this week.  The Presidency remains open and fully committed to working with all partners to secure a deal on the budget to ensure that it is put to work at the earliest opportunity to support employment and growth in Europe.</p><p>  The Presidency has also brokered agreements on a wide range of other issues including protecting citizens from serious cross-border threats to health, strengthening provisions on water quality in the EU, improving the safety of workers in offshore oil and gas prospection and protecting workers in contact with electromagnetic fields.  And we look forward to delivering more agreements over the coming weeks.</p><p>  The Government has invested a great deal in this Presidency, because we believe that Ireland&rsquo;s future and its future interests in Europe are best served by being an active and constructive Member State.  Building on the progress made to date, every member of Government will work over the coming weeks to deliver results that contribute to a better Europe.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-16a.233.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013051600054#WRH01100"><p>The legal position is that in the absence of a subordination agreement, where a financial institution is being wound up the principle that applies is <i>pari passu</i>. This means that holders of bonds in banks have equal ranking with depositors to be repaid in the event of insolvency of  the financial institution. So, where there is a shortfall in assets all unsecured creditors are entitled to an equal dividend. The principle of creditor equality is also enshrined in the Credit Institutions Winding Up Directive 2001/17/EC.</p><p>  In the context of a company that is continuing in business as a going concern the principle of pari passu does not apply although the effect is similar. Where a company has debts, they are liable to pay those debts and each debtor has an equal right to be repaid whether that person's debt arises on foot of a bond or a deposit. In either case the terms of the repayment will obviously be determined by the instrument creating or evidencing the debt - repayable on demand or at a certain future time. I would add that the principle of equal entitlement to be repaid their debts as amongst unsecured creditors is subject to the absence of one of them being obliged by contract to be postponed in favour of another.</p><p>  It must also be remembered that eligible depositors who suffer a loss in the event of a financial institution being wound up insolvent are entitled to compensation under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. The Deposit Guarantee Scheme covers all retail deposits with all credit institutions authorised in Ireland (including credit unions) up to a maximum of 100,000 euro per qualifying depositor per institution.</p></reply>

The legislation provides for an independent, impartial investigation and resolution of disputes between consumers and Financial Service Providers.</p><p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman was set up to adjudicate on unresolved disputes between complainants and financial service providers in an independent and impartial manner.  Prior to the establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsman complaints from consumers of insurance and credit institutions were handled by two voluntary ombudsman schemes.  The &ldquo;McDowell Report&rdquo; in 1999 recommended the establishment of a single statutory ombudsman scheme for all financial services provided by regulated entities, to operate independently of the Single Regulatory Authority and to operate as a &ldquo;one &ndash; stop &ndash; shop&rdquo; for regulated entities and their customers.</p><p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman is an out of court redress body that is free to the complainant.  </p><p>  If a consumer has made a formal complaint to the financial institution in question and if not satisfied with the reply they can contact the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to the matter.  The Financial Services Ombudsman investigates, in an impartial and independent manner, complaints from individual customers and small businesses who have unresolved disputes with financial service providers who are either regulated by the Central Bank or are subject to the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  All personal customers, unincorporated bodies, charities, clubs, partnerships, trusts, and limited companies with a turnover of &euro;3,000,000 or less can complain to the Ombudsman. </p><p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman has the power to award compensation of up to a maximum of &euro;250,000 or &euro;26,000 annuity where a complaint is upheld. The decisions of the Financial Services Ombudsman are binding on both parties subject only to an appeal by either the complainant or the financial service provider to the High Court.</p><p>  I have at present no plans to recommend to Government a review of section 57CL(1) of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act 2004. </p></reply>

A person whose only income source is from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) qualifies for deferral.  A person who qualifies for full deferral can opt to defer 100% of the LPT liability.  A person who qualifies for part deferral can opt to defer 50% of the liability and must pay the balance of LPT.  Interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum.  Full details of all deferral options are outlined in the Guidelines on Deferral or Part Deferral of Local Property Tax, which are available on Revenue's website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p><p>  The simplest and most straightforward way for some DSP payment recipients to pay their LPT liability is through deduction at source from certain payments that they receive from the Department.  The relevant payments are: State Pension (Contributory); State Pension (Non-Contributory); Widow/widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension; Widow/widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension; State Pension (Transition); One Parent Family Payment; Invalidity Pension; Carer's Allowance;  Disability Allowance; and Blind Pension.</p><p>  There are no fees or charges associated with deduction at source and the property owner simply indicates their payment preference on the online LPT Return form.  It should be noted that Section 92(2) of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that the LPT deduction may not reduce the net scheme payment below the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) rate, which is currently &euro;186 per week.  </p><p>  For someone who is temporarily unemployed the deferral option may be the most appropriate approach pending a change in his or her circumstances.  It may suit them to pay the tax in cash through one of the three approved payment service providers who are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  A transaction fee will be charged by the service providers concerned.  Alternatively, the liable person can use direct debit through a bank or credit union to make equal monthly payments of their LPT liability.  The financial institution involved may charge a transaction fee for this option.  Details of the full range of payment options are available on Revenue's website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p></reply>

At the outset I would like to clarify that this relief only applies where the adaptation work increases the market value of the property.   I would also refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to a similar Question No. 231 on 16th April.    The Deputy has requested that all possible scenarios that may arise under this relief will be catered for without adversely discriminating based on the nature of the disability or disabilities in question.  The relief under section 15A of the 2012 Act is provided to a person who has a disability within the meaning of section 2 of the Disability Act 2005.  Under section 2 of the 2005 Act, disability means a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the LPT legislation provides for the widest possible application of the relief.</p><p>  Section 15A of the 2012 Act provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority.  The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where adaptation work has increased the chargeable value of a property, the liable person determines the reduction in the chargeable value of the property and calculates the revised chargeable value and decides which valuation band is relevant to the property.  He or she should include the appropriate valuation band on his or her LPT Return, select a payment preference, and submit the return to Revenue.  No supporting documentation is required to be submitted with the Return.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the impact of such adaptations on a property may decrease its value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.</p></reply>

This fund aims to make loans of between &euro;5 million and &euro;50 million to borrowers that are established companies, with a strong credit profile and demonstrable ability to support sensible debt levels, and will not be mandated to lend to companies in distress.  The SME Credit Fund may also seek to acquire existing loans from other institutions, where those loans are scheduled to mature in the near term and where the existing lender intends to exit the lending market in Ireland. The NPRF commitment will be &euro;175 million to &euro;325 million depending on the quantum of capital raised from Irish and international investors.  The SME Credit Fund expects to have a portfolio of 25-30 investments once capital has been deployed.</p><p>  The NTMA is currently finalising documentation with BlueBay and BlueBay is marketing the Fund to prospective investors both in Ireland and overseas.   It is expected that the Fund will close and be launched by the middle of the year.  The rate of drawdown will depend on the rate at which Bluebay is able to make loan investments.  BlueBay is currently developing a pipeline of potential loan transactions.</p><p>  Details of individual investments made by the NPRF are commercially sensitive and, as a commercial investor, the NPRF is subject to confidentiality provisions in the various fund formation agreements.  The NPRF intends to publish a report regarding the investments made under the Strategic Investment Fund programme in July and January each year, commencing in July 2013.  Future announcements in respect of any material developments in relation to the SME Credit Fund will be made available on the NPRF website.</p></reply>

In January 2013 the NTMA sold &euro;2.5 billion of the existing bond maturing in 2017 at a yield of 3.32%, the first such syndicated deal for three years. In March 2013 the NTMA sold &euro;5 billion of a new 10 year bond, maturing in 2023, at a yield of 4.15%. These two bond sales alone account for over three quarters of the NTMA&rsquo;s working plan to issue &euro;10 billion in long-term debt during 2013. In parallel, the NTMA has continued with a regular schedule of treasury bill auctions in 2013 and saw the annualised yield demanded by investors for the three month maturity fall to 0.195% in April.</p><p>  The NTMA has indicated to investors and the market generally that it will continue with regular treasury bill auctions this year and, in that regard, it has already set out its specific plans for Quarter 2 of 2013. The NTMA has also engaged with the market in relation to a return to regular bond auctions during 2013 subject to market conditions, with the specific details to be announced at a later date.</p><p>  The new legislation on economic governance of the euro area, the so-called Two Pack, is expected to come into force on 30 May 2013. Under this legislation the State is required to provide quarterly and annual estimates of its debt issuance to the EU Commission but only after it is no longer in a macroeconomic adjustment programme.</p><p>  The Governing Council of the ECB made a decision to establish the Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) scheme on 2nd August 2012, and issued a press statement on 6th September 2012 which outlined its technical features.  This press statement sets out that a necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary market purchases. The ECB has also stated that OMT may also be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme &ldquo;when they will be regaining bond market access&rdquo;. The ECB press statement also notes that the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate. The decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is therefore a matter for the ECB.</p></reply>

In table A1.3, note 4 refers to the reclassification of an item from 'other expenditure, to 'social payments'.</p><p>  Before 2012, voluntary secondary schools were classified outside the general government sector. In September 2012 the CSO agreed with Eurostat to reclassify the non-fee paying voluntary secondary schools from non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH, S.15) to general government (S.13) with retrospective effect.</p><p>Although, this reclassification has little effect on the general government balance, the payment to non-fee paying voluntary secondary schools which was previously classified as a transfer payment (from the 'other' category) is now classified as compensation of employees and intermediate consumption.</p><p>  Initially the switch between categories was made from the 'social payments' category. It was subsequently deemed more appropriate to switch from the 'other' category. It is the transposition between these two categories that the note 4 of table A1.3 refers.</p><p>  The reduction in the 'other' expenditure category is offset by increased expenditure under ELG and derivative guarantees.</p><p>  It is important to state that this the action simply transposes an item from one type of transfer payment to another type of transfer payment. It has no effect on the balance. Nor does it affect the future or historic time series aligned to the new Government Finance Statistics tables produced by the CSO, as the effect is true for the whole time series.</p></reply>

This is not new information, it was made clear when the legislation was first published.  It is preferable that local councillors have a specific electoral mandate to vary the rate, which will be possible following the local elections in 2014.</p><p>  The Government sees the necessary introduction of the LPT as an opportunity for very real political reform at Local Government level. The LPT will provide a stable funding base for the local authority sector, incorporating appropriate elements of local authority responsibility. Providing local authorities with significant responsibility for raising local revenue has the potential to increase the level of oversight of local authority operations by the electors and thereby strengthen democracy at local level. This will strongly reinforce local democratic decision-making and will encourage greater efficiency by local authorities on behalf of their electorates.</p><p>  For the purposes of Local Property Tax (LPT), the initial property valuations for the valuation date of 1 May 2013, will be valid up to and including 2016. The next valuation date will be 1 November 2016 which will cover the period 2017 to 2019. </p><p>  The national central rate of LPT is 0.18% for properties valued up to &euro;1 million with the liability calculated based on the mid-point of the appropriate band.  The national central rates for properties valued over &euro;1 million are 0.18% on the first &euro;1 million and 0.25% on the excess value over &euro;1 million with no banding applied.  The Government has committed not to amend these rates for the lifetime of this Government.</p></reply>

Affordability is the key test in terms of meeting mortgage commitments and against the current backdrop of high levels of mortgage arrears, prudential policy by the financial institutions has led to more extensive analysis of present and prospective ability of by individuals and businesses to meet with credit commitments. It is not in the interest of the banks or the individual for finance to be provided unless the individual has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed, however credit policy would be expected to take account of the ability to repay against a backdrop of evolving circumstances. The interaction which the Government has with the banks is governed by the Relationship Frameworks, precluding the State from intervening in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions including with respect to pricing and lending decisions. These frameworks are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at http://banking.finance.gov.ie/presentations-and-latest-documents/.</p></reply>

The BRRD proposal aims to introduce an effective recovery and resolution framework for credit institutions and investment firms at national level to ensure minimum harmonisation at EU level. The proposal provides for three stages of crisis prevention and management - a preventative stage, an early intervention stage, and a resolution stage. Part of the resolution stage seeks <i>inter alia</i> to establish a hierarchy of bail-inable claims that would apply in a resolution context. The discussion on 14th May focused on the design of the bail-in tool which would enable resolution authorities to write down or convert into equity the claims of shareholders and creditors of institutions that are failing or likely to fail. Recent developments have highlighted the political importance of finding a common understanding on the scope and functioning of this tool and, in particular how uninsured deposits over &euro;100,000 should be dealt with in bail-in.</p><p>  I am glad to report that the discussion provided the Presidency with sufficient clarity on the position of Member States to enable us to press ahead with our efforts to achieve agreement on this file. In particular I noted convergence on a number of points:</p><p>- agreement among Member States that deposits under &euro;100,000 must be fully guaranteed;</p><p>- considerable support for depositor preference for uninsured deposits i.e. they<font color="#104160"> </font>would be the last category to be bailed-in;</p><p>- general agreement on a broad scope for bail-in, with a limited list of defined exclusions;</p><p>- general agreement that the level of loss absorbing capacity of an institution must be set at a level to match the scope of exclusions.</p><p>  The objective of the Irish Presidency in placing this item on the May ECOFIN agenda was to try to achieve a sensible compromise on this key issue which would help to unlock discussion on other areas of the BRRD notably the financing element. I am proposing to bring the BRRD dossier back to the ECOFIN on 21st June with a view to reaching a Council agreement. </p><p>  However the Deputy will appreciate that much depends on the willingness of all Member States to compromise on what are complex and difficult issues. For the Irish Presidency's part we will continue to afford top priority to the legislative files relating to Banking Union, including the BRRD, in line with the conclusions of the European Council which set out a time frame and series of steps for achieving this.</p></reply>

The issue concerned people who filed and paid via telephone through the LPT Helpline and who used credit or debit cards as the payment method.  In total, the details of 11 credit/debit cards were improperly obtained by an unauthorised employee of the company that operates the LPT Helpline on behalf of Revenue, and attempts were then made to use some of them for personal benefit.  The incident did not impact on anybody who filed and paid via computer, nor did it affect any of the other available payment options for Local Property Tax (LPT).</p><p>  I know that Revenue is extremely concerned about the incident and has, and continues to be, in contact with the company concerned.  I fully support the strong response and prompt action taken by the Commissioners.  I am informed that the matter is now in the hands of the Gardai and in the circumstances it would not be appropriate to comment further on that aspect of the matter.</p><p>  In regard to security, the company that operates the Helpline was able to very quickly identify the person responsible for the inappropriate access because it has very sophisticated call management and recording systems available to log all calls.  On concluding its investigation the company, which is both ISO and PCI accredited, assured Revenue that the incident was an isolated matter relating to a single individual.  It was not related to any technology or systems breach and was not related to the secure on-line payments system for LPT. </p><p>  When Revenue extended the facility to file and pay on-line, via the LPT Helpline, special arrangements were put in place with the company in line with best practice, including setting up a filing team which is located in a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and secure environment, with additional monitoring features, who do not have access to mobile phones or any other facility to record personal or payment details.  The person in question was not a member of this team, and had no authority to request any payment details from customers.</p><p>  Since the incident also constituted a data protection breach, Revenue reported it to the Data Protection Commissioner on Friday, and is continuing to liaise with that Office.</p><p>  Revenue has asked me to reassure the public that payment of tax by either credit or debit card is completely secure, and that in the unlikely event of any illegal access, the card owner will not suffer any loss.</p></reply>

We have also achieved agreement on the Capital Requirements Directive IV, which aims to strengthen the capital requirements for banks and the overall effectiveness of regulation for the sector and enhance financial stability.  </p><p>  We are working on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and on the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive as the essential next steps, with a view to agreement by June of this year, as envisaged by the European Council. Once this has been agreed, the European Commission is expected to submit a proposal for a single resolution authority shortly thereafter, which will build on the work now underway. </p><p>  The broad position of the Ecofin is that the building blocks for Banking Union should be put in place as soon as possible. This is a sensible approach and our work is helping to advance Banking Union in as speedy a manner as possible.</p><p>  Following the Declaration by Member States at the Informal Ecofin in April, the Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Michel Barnier, stated that treaty change is not a precondition for banking union, but if there were changes to the treaty later on these could be used to strengthen aspects of the banking union later on.  This is the basis on which we are all working. My understanding in relation to what the German Finance Minister has said must be seen in this context. </p><p>  Finally, as we move into the final weeks of our Presidency we will continue to afford top priority to the legislative files relating to Banking Union, including the BRRD, in line with the conclusions of the European Council which set out a time frame and series of steps for achieving this.</p></reply>

The aim of the pilot framework is to achieve sustainable and fair outcomes without the need for the borrower to enter the full insolvency process. It is focused on enhancing cooperation between lenders of secured and unsecured debt in order to resolve distressed debt at an early stage. </p><p>  The framework produced by the Central Bank establishes a series of principles to be applied in debt restructuring solutions for borrowers. In particular it outlines a &lsquo;Resolution Waterfall&rsquo; which sets out a series of debt affordability scenarios. Treatments will be applied to the borrower&rsquo;s debts in order to establish the most appropriate, affordable modification that sets the borrower on a sustainable footing for the remaining period of the loans. </p><p>  The framework will be implemented on a pilot basis by participating lenders using a representative sample of 750 borrowers who are experiencing significant financial difficulty repaying the mortgage on the family home and who have other unsecured debt. The pilot scheme will run for three months from the end of June and will conclude with a thorough review of all results to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework in dealing with such cases and to determine next steps.</p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that it has been agreed among the lender participants to use an independent third party service provider as the most appropriate way to engage with borrowers, whose consent to participate will be sought.  I am informed by the Central Bank that discussions are underway to determine the most appropriate provider and that no decision has yet been made. However I understand that an important consideration for the Central Bank, due to the short timelines involved, is the ability of the provider to provide an effective and efficient service at short notice. </p><p>  To be eligible for the Framework, a borrower must be co-operating with his lenders, as defined in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  It will apply to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty but who have taken reasonable steps to maximise income and curtail expenditure.   All existing protections afforded by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code and the CCMA will continue to apply to participating borrowers.   The Framework will not include borrowers with buy-to-let or business related debts.</p></reply>

In my previous replies I also indicated that the logistics of ensuring that the chosen payment option can be activated in good time for the July payment date determines the closing date for paper return filing of 7 May 2013.  The e-filing closing date of 28 May 2013 is the <i>de facto </i>extension to this date.  </p><p>  While the due date for filing paper LPT returns has now passed, a number of options are available to property owners for filing their returns electronically by the 28 May filing deadline. Depending on the customer's requirements, one of the following options will address their particular needs.</p><p>- For property owners for whom e-filing is not practical, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the legislation provides that another person may file an LPT Return online on their behalf.  </p><p>- Property owners can also visit their local Revenue office where computers and assistance to file online will be available.</p><p>- A further option includes contacting the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255 (mobile phone users can contact the helpline on 01 702 3049) to file a Return online.  </p><p>  Where, due to recent publicity about the attempted mis-use of credit card details, a property owner does not wish to give their credit or debit card details over the phone, if they own a single property, they can file online through the LPT helpline and opt to make their payment through deduction at source from their salary, occupational pension or pension from the Department of Social Protection, by cheque or in cash to one of three service providers.  It should also be noted that the credit card holder will not be held liable where the card is used without their proper authorisation.</p><p>  Given the range of options that have been made available by Revenue to assist people experiencing any difficulty in meeting their LPT obligations, and the fact that owners of residential properties have already filed in excess of 700,000 returns and utilised the different payment options, I am very satisfied with the current arrangements that Revenue has in place and the communication of these arrangements to the public. </p><p>  Therefore, I do not propose, nor is it practicable given the logistics involved, to extend the closing date or nor do I consider that any changes to Revenue's procedures are required in the run-up to the online LPT Return filing date.</p></reply>

During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.</p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are affected by the budget measure.  In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2013 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.</p><p>  In 2002, my Department agreed arrangements for the provision of funding for supervision in respect of mid-morning and lunch-time breaks which are set out in Circular 21/02. Specific arrangements apply in the case of small schools, i.e. 1, 2 and 3 teacher schools. In such schools, each teacher may claim payment for up to 37 hours per school year for the provision of supervision services. Payment for further hours of supervision, up to a maximum of 122 hours per school year, is made by grant to the Board of Management of the school. Some or all of the 122 hours may be undertaken by an external supervisor appointed by the school. For example, if the teacher(s) in the school opt out of the supervision scheme, all 122 hours can be undertaken by an external supervisor.</p><p>  In Ireland, given the number of relatively small schools that have four teachers or fewer, multi-grade classes are the norm in the majority of our primary schools. This is reflected in the centrally-devised Primary School Curriculum (1999) which articulates a progressive and developmental learning experience for our pupils. General guidance and advice for teachers are provided in National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) curriculum documents, and assessment guidelines etc. that are applicable to all primary schools. </p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down's syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Pupils with Down's syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.  There is not presently a distinct disability category of Down's syndrome for resource allocation purposes.  I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.</p><p>  My Department initially asked the NCSE in November 2011 to consider the issue of whether Down's syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability. In 2012 the NCSE were asked to provide comprehensive advice on how the educational system currently places and supports children with special educational needs in schools.  As part of this process it was agreed that the NCSE would include the advice on the Down's syndrome.  The NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs is currently in preparation and is expected shortly.  It is my intention that the significant resources to support children with Special Educational Needs are deployed to ensure the best possible outcomes for students. The advice will be a key input into achieving this goal. </p></reply>

The site was open to guided visitors form 31st May to 29th August in 2012 and the 2013 season will run from 30th May to 28th August. The opening and closing dates of Skellig Michael for visitors in 2013 will be 17th May to 30th September. In relation to extending the season at Skellig Michael, attempts have been made in previous years to extend the season into October. This has not proven to be successful due to weather conditions while also incurring the considerable costs associated with having a substantially extended visitor season.</p><p>  As is normal, the effective operational date for Skellig Michael is required to be approx 2 to 3 weeks in advance of the public opening with Office of Public Works staff travelling to the island early, weather permitting. This is so that the site can be prepared to receive visitors and significant Health and Safety preparations for the season carried out. In particular, the site is fully assessed after the winter, any hazards cleared from the steps and other public areas and any necessary minor repairs carried out. Given these requirements it is not possible to present the site to the public any earlier than 17th May.</p></reply>

To meet this commitment the Medium Term Fiscal Statement published in November 2012 indicated that, in addition to the overall consolidation of &euro;3.5 billion required for 2013, an additional &euro;3.1 billion  in savings and revenue raising measures must be identified for 2014 and &euro;2 billion in 2015. If the public service pay and pensions bill at 36% of spending is to make a proportionate contribution to the additional expenditure reduction currently identified as necessary for the next 3 years based on current economic forecasts, it will require a further reduction of some &euro;1 billion in the cost of the pay and pensions bill. To conform to our budgetary targets and continue on our path to economic recovery we need to make payroll savings of &euro;300m this year and &euro;1bn by 2015. The Government remains committed to achieving the required savings through negotiation and agreement.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-16a.392.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013051600059#WRN01200"><p> I understand that the issue of the impact of Circular 6/12: Public Procurement (Framework Agreements) for the procurement of goods and services on local jobs was raised by the Deputy with my colleague Minister of State Brian Hayes TD on 23 January 2013 (PQ 3220/13 refers).  You may recall that Minister Hayes did not indicate that an impact assessment had been carried out but noted that the impact on local jobs had been carefully considered and that very substantial dialogue with representatives of the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector had taken place before the introduction of the circular.</p><p>  The key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money.  It is also worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. When Circular 06/12 was being drafted the decision was made to include the existing national contracts that applied across the majority of the public sector as commonly purchased goods and services. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. </p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has developed tender documentation to encourage the participation of SMEs. For example, the contract for office supplies was divided into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper. SMEs that believed the scope of the competitions were beyond their technical or business capacities were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises. Through such relationships they could participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts that resulted from these competitions and therefore increase their social and economic benefits. </p><p>  Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders. For example, the indigenous company, which won the Stationery contract, with an estimated value of &euro;10m per annum, is sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers. </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>  Whilst the government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend we also want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.</p></reply>

Expanding trade is also essential to job creation: About 30 million jobs in the EU depend on sales to the rest of the world, an increase of 10 million jobs since 1995. On average, each additional &euro;1 billion of exports supports between 8,000 and 15,000 additional jobs across the EU. Research in Ireland by Forfas suggests that over 4 jobs are sustained by indigenous companies for every &euro;1 million in exports.</p><p>  Trade Negotiations underway or planned could boost EU GDP by more than 2% or &euro;250bn -equivalent to the size of the Austrian or Danish economy &mdash; and support an increase of more than 2 million jobs related to trade across the EU. Ireland will continue to target the markets where there are FTAs or where FTAs are in prospect to avail of the opportunities they present. </p><p>  In its report, issued in February this year, the EU-US High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth concluded that a comprehensive agreement addressing a broad range of bilateral trade and investment issues, including regulatory issues, and contributing to the development of global rules, would provide the most significant mutual benefit for both parties. An ambitious and comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) could benefit the EU economy by as much as &euro;119 billion per year and the US by up to &euro;95 billion. [For a family of four in the EU, that would translate on average to an extra &euro;545 in disposable income annually.] Consequently it recommended an ambitious approach to negotiating a trade and investment agreement between the two biggest parties in the transatlantic marketplace. </p><p>  The EU Council is considering a negotiating mandate that will set the parameters in which the EU Commission will seek to negotiate a TTIP. The Irish Presidency has prioritised securing agreement from EU member states on the final negotiating mandate.My Department is working intensively to achieve this at the Trade Council on June 14. The US is a traditional yet strong market for Ireland. In 2011 Ireland exported &euro;27 billion worth of Goods and Services to the US making the US our second largest export market, while total trade with the US was over &euro;58 billion.</p><p>  A comprehensive agreement with the US will remove virtually all tariffs and significantly reduce over time important regulatory and technical barriers to trade. These changes would reduce the cost of Irish exports to US consumers as well as reducing or eliminating the cost and administrative burden on firms having to meet two sets of regulatory and compliance requirements. An agreement with the US will also make it easier and cheaper to sell services to the US as well as new opportunities in gaining access to the huge US public procurement market.  As negotiations with the US have not yet started and as it will be some time before initial offers are exchanged it is not possible at this stage to establish precise detail about the economic impact on the economy.  </p><p>  EU-Japan</p><p>  The Japanese market for Irish goods and services presents many opportunities for Irish companies. In 2012 we exported over &euro;2 billion in goods to Japan, an increase of 20% on 2011. Trade with Japan is significant and that economy is our 11th  largest export market.</p><p>  Negotiations on a free trade agreement between the EU and Japan were launched on 25 March 2013. The aim is for a comprehensive agreement in goods, services and investment eliminating tariffs, non-tariff barriers and covering other trade-related issues, such as public procurement, regulatory issues, competition and sustainable development. </p><p>  Analysis is underway on the economic benefits of a trade agreement with Japan. As negotiations have only commenced in the past few weeks, certainty about the impact on the Irish economy will become clearer when initial offers are exchanged possibly next year.</p></reply>

The Supreme Court took the view that Registered Employment Agreements are instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals subject only to a limited power of veto by a subordinate body<font color="#FF0000">.</font>   While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution. </p><p>  The effect of this decision is to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act. In consequence the Labour Court no longer has jurisdiction to enforce, interpret or otherwise apply these agreements.  As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law. </p><p>  However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by Registered Employment Agreements are unaffected by the ruling. Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.</p><p>  There were 6 existing sectorial REAs registered or varied by the Labour Court in recent years: two in the Construction Sector and one each covering Electrical Contracting, Printing, Overhead Powerline Contractors and Dublin Drapery, Footwear and Allied Trades. It is estimated that between 70,000 and 80,000 workers were covered by these sectorial agreements. In addition, there were over 50 employment agreements covering individual enterprises that had been registered by the Court under the 1946 Act.</p><p>  The striking down of the REAs means that new employees in these sectors can now be hired at a rate agreeable between workers and their employers. This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.</p><p>  From the parties' perspective, the primary objective of REAs is to provide them with a sense of certainty around terms and conditions that will apply when the employer is tendering for and working through contracts and to have in place agreed grievance and industrial peace provisions. The agreements also have the effect of ensuring that the industry terms and conditions are recognised and maintained. In addition, the existence of these legally backed agreements is recognised under European Union law and ensures, in accordance with the Posted Workers Directive, that contractors from outside the jurisdiction, who may be using employees from lower wage economies, do not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs.</p><p>  This is a significant judgment that requires careful consideration having regard also to the amendments to the 1946 Act contained in the 2012 Industrial Relations Act. </p><p>  The Attorney General has been asked to supply advice on any potential implications of the judgment for the 1946 Act as amended by the 2012 Industrial Relations Act.</p></reply>

In addition major process improvement projects have been completed with significant improvements in processing times and the elimination of backlogs in many scheme areas.</p><p>  As a consequence of the very high number of decisions made in the last year, there has been a corresponding substantial increase in the number of appeals being received.  This had put pressure on the administration of appeals and resulted in some delays which are regrettable.  This is being addressed and will be cleared in the next number of months.  In addition, delays did develop in the processing of medical assessments and reviews due to a combination of factors including the increased workload for medical assessors and the reduced number of medical assessors due to retirements.  The Department has addressed this issue by recently running a competition to establish a new panel of medical assessors.  To date six Medical Assessors have been appointed from this panel, three of whom took up duty in November 2012 and a further three in March of this year.  It is expected that a further four medical assessors will be appointed from the panel in the near future. </p><p>  I place great emphasis on ensuring that all appeals are processed in a timely manner but the length of time from when an appeal against a refusal is accepted and registered with the appeals office to where the appeals office receives the file from the relevant scheme area varies.  Depending on the case quite a few activities must occur before the file can be finalised for submission to the appeals office, including time spent in the scheme area for comment by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  Because of its quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p><p>  In relation to the specific case highlighted I can confirm that the Department received a Carer's Allowance application from the person in question on the 23rd of February 2012.  The person concerned was refused carers allowance on the grounds that the care recipient is not so disabled as to require full time care and attention as prescribed in regulations.  He was notified of this decision, the reason for it, and of his right of review or appeal on the 8th of August 2012.  The applicant subsequently appealed this decision and sent in further medical evidence on the 31st of August 2012.  This medical evidence was scanned on 22nd of September 2012 and a review of the medical evidence was completed by a Medical Assessor on the 7th of January 2013.  The additional information did not alter the opinion of the medical assessor, the deciding officer saw no grounds to change the original decision and the file was submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office on the 18th of January 2013.  An Appeals Officer upheld the original decision to disallow the application and the appeal was disallowed on the 16th of April 2013.  Following the receipt of further medical evidence, the file was subsequently recalled by the Social Welfare Appeals Office and was returned to them on 30th of April 2013.  The file is currently with an Appeals Officer since the 3rd of May 2013.</p></reply>

The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website www.keepingyourhome.ie and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  </p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  All interested organisations will have an opportunity to input to the review of the service.</p></reply>

Its findings were discussed with national and European stakeholders at a conference last December.  The purpose of the study is to provide new insights into the relationship between work, unemployment and poverty, which has assumed greater importance with the economic recession and the subsequent rise in unemployment.</p><p>  A particular focus of the study was on the EU concept of jobless households, defined as households where the total time allocated to work by working age adults is less than 20 per cent. The study found that the population aged 0 to 59 in jobless households rose from 13 per cent in 2005 to 22 per cent in 2010, which is twice the EU average. The high proportion of the population in jobless households reveals a structural problem that predates the current recession, though it has been exacerbated by the rise in unemployment. The severity of the problem in Ireland reflects a number of factors, namely, a higher percentage of the adult population who are not economically active; a greater likelihood that jobless adults live with other jobless adults, and a higher proportion of children living with adults in jobless households. Such households, in effect, contain adults who are furthest from the labour market and who generally have a strong pattern of educational and social class disadvantages. Furthermore, children in jobless households are at risk of inter-generational poverty.</p><p>  The main policy conclusion from this study is that the number of jobless households is a key factor in determining overall levels of poverty and social exclusion. Social transfers play a key role in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate among jobless households and, compared to other EU countries, are considerably more effective in reducing poverty. Despite this, jobless households still experience higher levels of basic deprivation and consistent poverty and account for two-thirds of the total population in consistent poverty.</p><p>  To address the issue, the Government, as part of the national social target to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 and to 2 per cent of less by 2020, has agreed to set a sub-target to reduce the share of jobless households in consistent poverty.  The key to ensuring that the target will be addressed is an active labour market policy. A Programme for Government priority for 2013 is to make sure that economic recovery does not bypass jobless households, by enhancing the Pathways to Work strategy to ensure new jobs go to people on the Live Register. The Government is implementing a number of actions which will have a positive impact on jobless households including (i) the new integrated employment and support service (Intreo); (ii) streamlining and restructuring of working age supports; (iii) improving labour market measures to assist those furthest from the labour market, in particular the long-term unemployed; and (iv) an area-based response to child poverty.</p></reply>

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short, also provides for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.</p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department.  As part of the registration process, applicants are requested to provide documentation supporting the authentication of their identity.  This is most easily achieved through the presentation of secure photographic ID (such as a passport, National Identity card or driver&rsquo;s licence).</p><p>  The process does take into account that some people will not have such documents.  In the main, these will be UK or Irish nationals as, to be present in the jurisdiction, others will require a valid passport or National ID card.

As part of this initiative a city in Ireland is selected and designated as a National City of Culture every two years, with the designation itself lasting for one calendar year.  Limerick City will be first National City of Culture in 2014 giving the City an opportunity to shape and brand the new Limerick.</p><p>  Limerick City is undergoing a process of profound change at present and 2014 is an important year for the city as it will be the year in which a new single local authority will be established.  The Limerick Reorganisation Implementation Group (LRIG) is preparing for this change, and I believe that the designation of Limerick as a City of Culture will help to shape, brand and promote a new Limerick city.</p><p>  Limerick's preparations are well underway with former European Parliament President Pat Cox leading the initiative, joined by two other internationally renowned Freemen of Limerick.  These are Riverdance composer Bill Whelan and rugby international Paul O'Connell. I understand that proposals from interested applicants for 2014 are now being accepted by LRIG.  Further details are available </p><p>  The aim of the National City of Culture Initiative is to deliver a programme of cultural events and engagement in a city for one calendar year and to build a longer-term positive impact.  The National City of Culture Initiative will seek to bring artists, arts organisations, local authorities and civic groups that are working in a city together not only through the design of a calendar of events that showcases all that the city has to offer in arts and cultural expression, but also to generate a legacy in cultural co-operation among all the citizens of the city.  There are a number of excellent galleries, theatres and museums operating in Limerick and these venues will play an important role in the 2014 programme of events. </p><p>  I am awaiting a proposed programme of events for 2014 from the LRIG. As soon as I have received this proposed programme, the question of funding will be considered.  </p><p>  An EU study in 2004 found that the designation of European Capital of Culture served as a catalyst for the cultural development and transformation of the chosen city, and it is aimed to replicate these benefits on the national stage through this initiative.</p></reply>

As part of Ireland's obligations under the Directive, 53 Special Areas of Conservation were nominated for designation between 1997 and 2002 for the protection of Active Raised Bog, Degraded Raised Bog still capable of natural regeneration and Bog Woodland. Each of these habitats is listed in Annex I of the Directive. </p><p>  The choice of sites for selection as SACs arose from an extensive survey of the habitats in Ireland and the application of the scientific criteria specified in Annex III of the Directive. In short, the criteria used included:</p><p>-    The degree of representivity of the natural habitat type on the site. </p><p>-   The area of the site covered by the natural habitat type in relation to the total area covered by that natural habitat type within national territory.</p><p>-   The degree of conservation of the structure and functions of the natural habitat type concerned and restoration possibilities.</p><p>-   A global assessment of the value of the site for conservation of the natural habitat type concerned.</p><p>  The reasoning behind the nomination for designation of each individual site is contained in the <i>Natura 2000 standard data form,</i> which can be viewed on my Department's website at .  The ownership of these bogs was not a central consideration in their selection for survey or designation and there are no precise details  available to my Department of the area of State or semi-State land which  were surveyed or designated as raised bog SAC.  I understand however, that of the 53 designated raised bog SAC there were significant amounts of State owned land in 33 of these sites at the time of survey.</p><p>  My Department does not have details of the total area of raised bog owned by the State or semi-State companies.</p></reply>

A further 3,534 letters and site-packs  were issued to persons potentially affected by the proposed designations in 2002 of the remaining raised bog sites. These letters included maps of the sites, as well as details of restrictions to activities therein, compensation provisions, and the manner in which an objection might be made to the proposed designation. </p><p>  My Department sources its information for issuing letters from a number of sources, including the Property Registration Authority, the Land Commission (now Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine), the Land Parcel Identification System used by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine,  and the electoral register. </p><p>  It should be noted that the development of the Land Direct system by the Property Registration Authority in recent years has allowed much more comprehensive land-owner identification. This has improved the Department&rsquo;s ability to reach as many interested parties as possible.  While every reasonable step has been taken over the years to identify landowners and notify them directly, it is not possible to guarantee that all such persons can be identified.  It is commonplace, particularly in bogs, that individuals&rsquo; interests are not registered at all, or not in their own names. Turbary rights, in particular, are not always up to date or accurately reflect actual land use activity. </p><p>  For this reason, and in accordance with the Regulations referred to above, copies of maps of proposed SACs and copies of the Government Notices relating to those sites are also displayed in public access points such as Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations, local authority offices, local offices of the Department of Social Protection, local offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and offices of Teagasc located within or near the sites concerned.  Proposals to designate sites as SACs are also advertised in the appropriate local newspapers with radio advertisements being run on local stations.  A free-phone number is also operated to facilitate the dissemination of information to those who are alerted through these publicity measures. </p></reply>

The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012. The Survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency.</p><p>  The categorisation methodology for the survey was different to that which was used in 2011 and which provided the basis for the waiver from the household charge. That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development. The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development, and established that there were 1,700 unfinished developments, with 1,100 of them deemed to be in a seriously problematic condition. This represents a 37% reduction in unfinished developments since 2010.</p><p>  Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the LPT regulations.</p><p>  For purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the local property tax would apply local authorities were asked by my Department in February 2013 to confirm or update the then existing list of estates in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo; as appropriate.

The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.</p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. Guidelines have issued to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 and local authorities are expected to implement these guidelines appropriately.   2013 is the last year of operation of the Charge.

She was refused registration on this occasion as she has been out of permission since March 2010.

On receipt of the documents requested, her case will then be examined by the relevant officials in INIS.

Update the LPIS database following annual reviews of land parcels as required under the European Union's Integrated Administrative and Control System, governing the implementation of the Single Payment Scheme and other area related schemes. </p><p>  3.

Regarding beef, in particular, there are comprehensive regulations governing the identification of bovines and the labelling of their meat. These provisions were introduced in the wake of the BSE crisis to improve traceability.</p><p>  In general, all fresh, frozen or minced beef marketed in the EU (with the exception of offal) is subject to a mandatory system of origin traceability and origin labelling. The purpose of these rules is to ensure that beef on sale can be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it came. </p><p>  There are two elements to the beef labelling regime which apply to all parts of the supply chain; the compulsory system, which requires food business operators to label their beef products (unless cooked or processed) with certain prescribed information up to and including the point of sale to the consumer; and the voluntary system, which covers any other labelling claim that processors or retailers wish to make concerning the origin, characteristics or production methods of the beef they are supplying. The claims made on product labels, marketing material or point of sale notices must be clear and cannot be misleading. </p><p>  The rules already require that beef labels indicate the country or countries where the animal (or group of animals) from which it was derived was born, reared and slaughtered. Where beef is derived from an animal (or group of animals) born, reared or slaughtered in a single country, this information may be grouped together under the heading &lsquo;Origin:&rsquo; followed by the name of the relevant Member State or third country.</p></reply>

This represents a major breakthrough in the negotiations and represents a considerable success for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU.</p><p>  The new position drafted by the Council of Ministers is based on a revised 200 page compromise legal text which I presented to Fisheries Ministers early on Wednesday morning and I greatly welcome the support received from my EU Ministerial colleagues. This agreement follows very difficult and complex negotiations and amounts to a significant step forward on behalf of EU Fisheries Ministers. It enables further crucial negotiations with the European Parliament to take place which will hopefully lead to an agreed package of significant reforms being agreed in the coming weeks. This decision by the Council is a major conciliatory step in the direction of the European Parliament&rsquo;s own position on the reforms and should hopefully pave the way for successful conclusion of the complex inter-institutional negotiations on the reform. It is evidence of the importance placed by Fisheries Ministers on ensuring that this radical package of measures is finally agreed. </p><p>  The Irish Presidency has prioritised securing CFP reform before the end of its term and three-way talks (trilogues) between the Council, European Parliament and Commission will now continue with the aim of achieving that goal on the basis of this new position drafted by the Council of Ministers. The Council has recognised the practical challenges for fishermen and the potential socio-economic impacts in coastal communities during the negotiations over the past number of months. I believe that the historical package agreed with the Council of Ministers this week will prepare the way for a European wide discards ban, facilitate more sustainable fishing levels in addition to appropriate management of fleet capacity and a lead to a workable regionalisation policy. It will provide the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry. The package agreed this week will allow us to rebuild fish stocks in European waters and will allow for setting TACs and quotas to reflect catches when a landing obligation is introduced on the basis that for the first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock no longer be allowed. In the longer term as fish stocks reach and are maintained at healthy levels, it will support increased fishing opportunities for our fishermen. </p><p>  It is important to emphasise that we are under no illusions as to the scale of the final challenge facing us in securing agreement with the European Parliament. The strong compromise mandate given to me this week however places a responsibility on our co-legislators in the European Parliament to show reciprocal flexibility to facilitate a successful conclusion on the Common Fisheries Policy reforms, which is the objective of both institutions. I remain cautiously optimistic that final agreement can be secured by the end of the Irish Presidency.</p></reply>

I outlined the positive and constructive nature of the negotiations between the three institutions, with good progress made on a number of issues across all four CAP reform dossiers. However, I drew Ministers&rsquo; attention to the fact that, notwithstanding this forward movement, the three institutions hold quite different views in a number of areas. These will require political input to resolve if the reform package is to be agreed by the end of June. </p><p>  We had a discussion on some of the issues that have already presented themselves as politically sensitive in the course of the trilogue discussions. The first of these relates to the definition of &lsquo;active farmer&rsquo;, and particularly the concept of a &lsquo;negative list&rsquo; of entities which would not be considered active farmers and would therefore not receive direct payments under the reformed CAP. Member States want such a negative list to be a voluntary provision, while the European Parliament would prefer it to be mandatory. </p><p>  The second issue relates to the proposed young farmers&rsquo; scheme. Again, the discussion focused on the question of whether this scheme should be mandatory or voluntary for Member States. The Council&rsquo;s view is that the scheme should be voluntary, while the Parliament prefers a mandatory approach. Similarly, on the small farmers&rsquo; scheme, although the Council and Parliament agree that the scheme should be voluntary for Member States, the discussion focused on whether a change proposed by the Commission would allow it to become a mandatory scheme for all Member States, which the Commission would strongly prefer.</p><p>  I was pleased with the exchanges on all three issues. Member States had been asked to consider how an agreement with the Parliament and Commission might be achieved and I noted a broad sense of flexibility and openness from Member States. </p><p>  The exchanges at Council represent the beginning of the final phase of negotiations and we are all conscious of the need for reasonable compromise if we are to get a deal agreed by the end of June. That requires movement from all three institutions and not just from the Council. I do not underestimate the efforts that will be required by all three institutions if we are to achieve our target but I am satisfied, based on progress to date, that we are on track to achieve political agreement between the three institutions on reform of the CAP by the end of June.</p></reply>

Co. Dublin has been caused by a recent increase in the number of young people being referred by the Courts, compared to the trend over the past few years. This has put severe pressure on the number of bed spaces available in the Children Detention Schools. </p><p>  I am considering all options to resolve the matter and my Department is working closely with the Board of Management of the detention schools to resolve the staffing issues which have delayed the opening of an 8 bed unit in Trinity House School.</p><p>  The Irish Youth Justice Service of my Department operates a bed management system, on a 24 hour basis and will continue to ensure that the courts are notified of beds as they become available.</p><p>  Following extensive conciliation and staff consultation facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, a new cross campus roster which provided for flexibility in the deployment of staff across the campus came into operation with effect from 25 February 2013. This replaced rostering arrangements which had been in place for over 30 years and is at the early stages of its implementation. However, staff absenteeism has meant that it has not been possible to reopen an 8  bed unit in Trinity House School, which when open will provide additional capacity to the courts. </p><p>  An extensive audit of the new rostering arrangements is currently underway and the efficiency and effectiveness of these new arrangements will be reviewed.</p><p>  I assumed legal responsibility for the Children Detention Schools in Oberstown on 1 January 2012.  On 2 April 2012, I announced a capital investment package for the Oberstown Children Detention schools project in Lusk, Co Dublin. This project is on target and  construction is due to start in July 2013 and 3 new units will be completed by mid 2014. Tenders for the new development were received on 3 May 2013 and the evaluation of tenders received will be carried out by the Office of Public Works over the coming weeks. </p><p>  The Government remains fully committed to ending the use of St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution for the detention of children by developing the required facilities on the Oberstown campus. </p><p>  With effect from 1 May 2012, I also announced the ending of the practice of detaining 16 year old boys in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution through using existing capacity that was available on the Oberstown children detention school campus. Since July 2012 there have been no 16 year old boys detained in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. The numbers being detained in Oberstown have, however, increased significantly.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the decision to have 16 year old boys detained in the detention schools and end the practice of sending them to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution was the correct one and fulfils Government and international imperatives to end the imprisonment of children. This decision was taken following detailed consideration of patterns of remands and committals of children over the previous 2 years.</p></reply>

The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed last year by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of pirfenidone and concluded that, at the submitted price, pirfenidone is not cost-effective for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The report is available on the NCPE's website (www.ncpe.ie).</p><p>  The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug. The HSE is currently in negotiations with the manufacturers of pirfenidone and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further while these negotiations are ongoing.

The NAS deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to an incident.  For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible. Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is currently progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place, including in the greater Dublin area, and are operating successfully.</p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed key performance indicators (KPIs) for pre-hospital emergency care, which classify 999 emergency calls by clinical status.  Clinical Status 1 (Echo) calls involve life-threatening emergencies of cardiac or respiratory origin, while Clinical Status 1 (Delta) calls involve life-threatening emergencies other than cardiac or respiratory. The target times for responding to Echo and Delta calls are 7 minutes 59 seconds by a first responder (a person trained in minimum basic life support and use of a defibrillator) and 18 minutes 59 seconds for a patient-carrying vehicle. With effect from January 2012, HIQA set the standard at 75% within the target time for first responders and a target has been set at 80% within the target time for patient-carrying vehicles.</p><p>  The NAS has been taking a number of steps to improve emergency responses. These include development of a Performance Improvement Action Plan, an Intermediate Care Service, the national control centre reconfiguration project and a trial emergency aeromedical service.</p><p>  In light of the above, and following a review of the validity of time-based KPIs, it is considered, in line with international views, that clinical outcomes would be more appropriate as performance indicators. Accordingly, work has begun on their development.  I also welcome the fact that use of clinical indicators will enable a focus on Clinical Status 1 (Echo and Delta) calls.  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The programme involves a number of measures, including the Performance Improvement Action Plan, development of the intermediate care service, the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), and the NAS Control Centre Reconfiguration Project. In particular, the National Ambulance Service (NAS) is developing staff clinical skills in line with the development of paramedic professional qualifications by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council. </p><p>  The NAS is a forward-looking service. It deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and on an area and national, rather than a local, basis. It has been, and still is, undergoing major transformation, including in terms of clinical skills and work practices, application of technology and modernisation of management and infrastructure. Many of these initiatives are still in train and I am confident that they will result in the improvements in the treatment available in pre-hospital care to seriously ill and injured patients.</p></reply>

Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than their own but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualifications for public health and safety and consumer protection.  In certain circumstances, non-EEA nationals who are legally resident in Ireland can benefit from the provisions of the Directive.</p><p>  For the purpose of the Directive, a regulated profession is defined as a professional activity access to which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications.  Where statutory registration does not exist for a profession in Ireland, as is the case with Psychology at present, non-Irish qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the public health sector.  </p><p>  The Directive provides for mutual recognition of qualifications for certain professions.  In the case of the health and social care professions, the Directive does not provide for automatic recognition of professional qualifications obtained in another Member State; it provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in the host member state.  If the activities covered by the profession in the home and the host member state are not comparable but deficits in the qualifications are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be considered.  If deficits still remain, the host Member State must offer an applicant a compensation measure, a choice of completing an adaptation period or taking an aptitude test.</p><p>  EuroPsy the European standard of education and professional training in psychology set by the European Federation of Psychologists&rsquo; Association can form part of an individual&rsquo;s application for assessment of qualification for equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualification required to work as a psychologist in the public health sector.</p></reply>

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal. This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. </p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. </p><p>  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses. Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.  </p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>  To conclude, far from abandoning its commitment to universal GP care, this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.</p></reply>

The UK also informed the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) and notified the WHO under the International Health Regulations.  From September 2012 to date, the WHO has been informed of a global total of 34 laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with nCoV, including 18 deaths.  There have been no cases in Ireland to date.</p><p>  Here in Ireland, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued guidance to hospitals, GP's and Directors of Public Health concerning the management of patients who present with severe respiratory symptoms and a history of travel to the Middle East.  The HPSC recommends:</p><p>- Continued surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.</p><p>- Testing for nCoV should be considered in patients with unexplained pneumonias, or in patients with unexplained severe, progressive illness or complicated respiratory illness not responding to treatment, particularly in persons travelling from or resident in areas of the world known to be affected.</p><p>- Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible.</p><p>- Clinicians are reminded that nCoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms in patients who are significantly immunocompromised.</p><p>- Any clusters of SARI in healthcare workers should be thoroughly investigated.</p><p>- New cases and clusters of nCoV should be immediately reported to local Departments of Public Health.</p><p>  The HPSC has issued guidance documentation on surveillance for nCoV, the investigation and management of suspected or confirmed cases, infection prevention and control and the submission on samples to the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) for investigation.  The NVRL is co-ordinating any diagnostic investigations required.  It should be noted that all primary cases of nCoV in Europe have been associated with travel in the Middle East.  Person to person transmission has only occurred in a very small number of people who have had prolonged contact with infected people.  At present there are no restrictions on travel to any areas in the Middle East and screening of travellers from those areas is not recommended.</p><p>  Further information, including copies of the guidance documentation, can be found on the HPSC website - www.hpsc.ie/hpsc/A-Z/Respiratory/CoronavirusInfections.  I can assure the Deputy that the situation continues to be monitored closely.</p></reply>
