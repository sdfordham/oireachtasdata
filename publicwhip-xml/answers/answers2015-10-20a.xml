    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-20a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000058#WRA00700"><p>I am advised that the number of burglary and related offences recorded in the CSO official crime figures for the Tipperary Garda Division in each of the years  in question was 737 in 2011, 693 in 2012, 755 in 2013, 637 in 2014 and 269 in 2015 up to 30 June.</p>  <p>  While the number of incidents in Tipperary is down over the past year, I recognise that burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, particularly in the very distressing situations where householders may be assaulted by the criminals involved.  I am conscious of the serious impact of such crimes on families and communities and recognise the public concern at these crimes, in Tipperary and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined in answer to other questions today, my response to burglaries, and to crime generally, is focussed on two key objectives; strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively.  Earlier this year I initiated a broad and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries.  This included a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.</p>  <p>  On foot of this review, I have published the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, 2015.  This legislation targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending.  The key objective of this legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who prey on law abiding householders and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others.  As the Deputy is aware the detail of the legislation is currently before the Houses of Oireachtas for debate and I hope to have it enacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I am also in ongoing contact with the Commissioner to ensure that we maximise the enforcement of all relevant laws in this area, by providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the appropriate supports to take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which has led to 14,672 arrests, and 8,358 charges brought to date.  I am providing the Commissioner with the means to enhance this operational response.  Most significantly, last September we reopened the Garda College to new recruits for the first time since 2009.  To date, 400 new Garda&iacute; have started their training, with the first 295 having already passed-out and are now working in communities nationwide. 150 more recruits are due to enter Garda College in coming weeks, and, following the Budget Day announcements, there will be a further 600 new recruits in 2016, underlining the Government's commitment to providing communities throughout the country with the reassurance that comes from a visible and determined police force.</p>  <p>  In a modern context the provision of policing in rural areas must be focussed on highly mobile and flexible responses to crime patterns and the needs of communities.  This will be facilitated by the very significant investment in Garda vehicles and equipment including the &euro;700,000 for new high powered vehicles in 2015, and &euro;1.75m to upgrade surveillance equipment on Garda aircraft.  In all, we have invested nearly &euro;29 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with 370 new vehicles coming on stream already this year.  In addition, the future commitment to supporting an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in opposing criminals in all areas of the country is underscored by the Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 which makes provision for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, as well as very significant investment in new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to an investment of &euro;205m over the life of the Plan.</p>  <p>  With the benefit of the very significant allocations which the Government is making for Garda resources, I am working closely with the Commissioner to finalise details of an enhanced operational response to burglaries and related crimes, and I expect to be in a position to make further announcements in this regard shortly.  These measures represent an investment in the safety of our communities and underscore the commitment of this Government to ensure that those on the frontline in tackling crime, including burglary, have the capacity to do so effectively.</p></reply>

It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative or at the request of a party to the proceedings, invite the parties to consider mediation as an alternative means of resolving the matter and suspend the proceedings to facilitate that process.</p>  <p>  I very much regret that it has not been possible to publish this Bill to date.  This has been due to the extensive programme of progressive law reform undertaken by my Department in accordance with the ambitious targets set out in the Programme for Government.  However, while it is not possible to give a specific date for publication of the Bill at this stage, I intend to proceed quickly with enactment of the Bill following its publication in due course.</p></reply>

I know that this matter was the subject of a topical issues debate in the House last week and as my colleague Minister of State English advised, on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, it has been acknowledged by the Health authorities that we do need to strengthen our legislative response in this area.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State advised, the Health authorities are conducting a review of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to introducing substantial additional controls on certain prescription drugs being traded illicitly including benzodiazepines and z-drugs.</p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate controls on prescription medicines are complex bearing in mind that we must take account of the need to facilitate the legitimate supply chain and legitimate use of such products unlike, for example, when dealing with more traditionally controlled substances for which there is little or no legitimate medicinal use.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Health that the review of the existing controls governing the supply of these medicines has required a very detailed process of consultation with the Health authorities engaging with relevant stakeholders including industry, patient organisations, other Government Departments and Agencies and the wider general public.</p>  <p>  Of course, consultation has also taken place with officials from my own Department and with the Agencies charged with law enforcement in this area including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  Arising from this consultation process, and as my colleague Minister of State English confirmed during the debate last week, substantial amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 are envisaged.</p>  <p>  I understand that work was well advanced but was of necessity delayed by virtue of work required on foot of the adverse finding made by the Court of Appeal in March this year concerning the constitutionality of section 2 (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  As indicated to the House last week the Department of Health is progressing new legislation in response to this judgment which will facilitate the making of new regulations in the future including those we have discussed today.</p>  <p>  I do appreciate the Deputy's call for urgency on this matter.  I can fully support the work being done to strengthen controls in relation to these products and I would welcome the new measures being brought forward at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

The objective was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  The review resulted in a reconfigured district and station network aimed at deploying the organisation's resource base to optimal effect.  The resulting Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme led to the closure of 139 Garda Stations and the amalgamation of 32 Garda districts during the course of 2012 and 2013.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there were no Garda station closures between 2000 and 2011 in County Wexford.  There were two station closures in County Wexford in 2012: Ballywilliam and Baldwinstown; and the station in Kiltealy closed in 2013.  There are no plans to reopen these stations.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to providing the best possible policing service to the people of Ireland within the resources available.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly reviews and assesses the organisation's capabilities and the deployment of those resources to provide an effective policing service.  The needs of the community and the ability of the organisation to contribute to public safety and community protection remains the foremost consideration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities advise me that local Garda Management in Wexford closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p></reply>

All aspects of the original investigation and subsequent reviews have been examined by the Garda Review Team.  As part of the Garda inquiry, a file is currently with the Director of Public Prosecution following the arrest of a person in October 2014 in connection with the disappearance.  I understand that the case has also been the subject of an investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, on foot of complaints to that office.  I am further advised that within the past two weeks, further statements have been made to the Garda&iacute; in relation to the case and that these will now be examined by the Review Team.</p>  <p>  I would also restate my concern that nothing we say add to the distress the family has experienced and that the examination of allegations concerning the disappearance are matters for the relevant investigatory agencies.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to the ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute;, and to this end the first intake since 2009 of new recruits commenced training at the Garda College, Templemore, in September of last year.</p><p>To date there has been four intakes of Garda Trainees to the Garda College, giving a total intake of 400.  A further 150 recruits will enter college by year end, bringing total recruitment of Garda Trainees to 550. So far 295 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On attestation, new Probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are assigned to mainstream uniform policing duties.  I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;.</p><p>The increased budget allocation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016 which I announced last week, provides for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; in addition to the 550 that will be recruited by year end.  The ongoing recruitment of new Garda&iacute; is crucial to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the safety of communities throughout the State.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>This ramped-up recruitment underscores the determination of this Government to deliver an effective, responsive police service to protect our communities and respond to emerging crime trends.</p><p>This additional recruitment is being further supported by reform and efficiency measures.  For example, the civilianisation of frontline immigration control procedures at Dublin Airport is freeing up Garda&iacute; for core policing duties and allowing the much reduced number of Garda&iacute; who will continue to be based at the airport to focus on the policing and intelligence aspects of border control rather than routine immigration and passport checks.</p></reply>

A number of successful partnership projects are already in place including in relation to Metal Theft, the Theft of Livestock, the new 'Theftstop' initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme.  While the detail of crime prevention measures are a matter for the Garda authorities in the first instance, I will of course be glad to give careful consideration to any further proposals for initiatives involving the IFA or other community stakeholders, in consultation with the Garda authorities.  I am confident that further partnership working can assist in tackling crime and meeting the needs of rural communities, and I would like to acknowledge the value of the valuable work done to date by all involved.</p>  <p>  With the benefit of the very significant allocations which the Government is making for Garda resources, I am working closely with the Commissioner to finalise details of  an enhanced operational response to burglaries and related crimes, and I expect to be in a position to make further announcements in this regard shortly.  These measures represent an investment in the safety of our communities and underscore the commitment of this Government to ensure that those on the frontline in tackling crime, including burglary, have the capacity to do so effectively.</p></reply>

We continue to ensure that violent offenders and other serious offenders serve appropriate prison sentences while at the same time switching away from prison sentences and towards less costly non-custodial options for non-violent and less serious offenders.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that it is continuing to reduce the capacity of our prisons to align with the Inspector of Prisons recommended bed capacity of 3,982 in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  On 7th October 2015 there were 3,663 prisoners in custody which is 92% of the Inspector's recommended total capacity of 3,982.  Significant decreases in prison numbers have taken place.  The overall daily average number in custody for 2014 was 3,915 compared to 4,390 in 2011, a decrease of 10.8%.  The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23rd February 2011.  On the 7th October 2015, there were 958 less prisoners in custody, a decrease of 21%.</p>  <p>  Huge improvements have been made to prison conditions in recent years. Overcrowding has been eliminated in Mountjoy Prison and priority has been given to addressing capacity issues in Cork, Limerick and the D&oacute;chas Centre.  All of the wings in Mountjoy Prison have been completely refurbished thereby facilitating the elimination of the practice of slopping out in the prison.  A completely new replacement prison in Cork is almost complete and will be operational by early 2016.  The enabling works for a major redevelopment of Limerick Prison are also scheduled to begin in 2016 with the main construction phase to start in early 2017.  Significant building and refurbishment projects are also scheduled for 2016 in Castlerea Prison.</p>  <p>  Alternatives to custody continue to be pursued and legislation has already been passed.  This includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered.</p>  <p>  The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances.  It further provides, inter alia, that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date, the Court may make an attachment order to earnings as a means of recovering the unpaid fine.  As a result of this legislation, it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prisons on short sentences.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has continued the national roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which carefully selected offenders can be granted structured temporary release in return for supervised community service.  In addition to this programme, Community Support Schemes have been set up in Cork Prison, Mountjoy Campus, West Dublin Campus and Limerick Prisons, the aim of which is to reduce recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release.</p></reply>

As regards investment in Garda technology and ICT, the Plan provides an additional &euro;205 million.

I am in close contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that the policing response is effective and that Garda operations take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences, both in rural and urban areas.</p>  <p>  In recent times, Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been co-ordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is a national operation targeting burglary by using an intelligence and analysis-led approach.  In support of Operation Fiacla, there are burglary related operations in place in each Garda Division.</p>  <p>  Special targeted patrols have been implemented with the assistance of Garda National Support Services against criminal groups.  These arrangements have also targeted the use of motorways by criminal gangs and have contributed to the arrest of a number of high-priority suspects.</p>  <p>  The sustained Garda response under Operation Fiacla has produced many successes in disrupting those involved in this type of criminal activity.  As of 31 August 2015, Operation Fiacla had led to 14,381 arrests, with 8,181 persons charged.</p>  <p>  This Government has been determined to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.  Since 2012, we have invested almost &euro;29 million in renewing the Garda fleet to support front line Garda responses.  So far this year 370 new vehicles have come on stream including new specialised vehicles.  I informed the House today that I have secured an allocation of a further &euro;5.3m to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purchase of a further 260 vehicles between now and the end of the year.  This new investment will provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motor cycles for high visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing.  This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue  under the Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan.  The increased budget allocation for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.</p>  <p>  This substantial level of investment will be accompanied by the continued renewal of Garda personnel with 600 new Garda to be recruited next year on top of the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year.  The totality of this investment will ensure that Garda&iacute; have the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of highly-mobile criminal gangs and to disrupt crime, particularly burglaries, across both rural and urban communities.</p></reply>

In 2013 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na published  Community Crime Prevention Guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of various community and neighbourhood watch schemes.  The Deputy will also be aware that there are several other initiatives which have been established in partnership with the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations, including the well established Community Alert Programme, the ongoing work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the new Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I am pleased to say that the Budget Day announcements included significantly increased funding from my Department for the Community Alert programme.</p>  <p>  While the detail of crime prevention measures, such as the UK example referred to, are a matter for the Garda authorities in the first instance, I will of course be glad to give careful consideration to any further proposals for such initiatives in consultation with the Garda authorities.  I am confident that further partnership working can assist in tackling crime and meeting the needs of rural communities, and I would like to acknowledge the value of the valuable work done to date by all involved.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that this practice, which has been followed by my predecessors, arises for sound security reasons.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Section 12 of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 places a requirement on the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure that such arrangements are in place to limit to the minimum necessary the disclosure of the fact that an authorisation has been given, and the contents of any communication which has been intercepted pursuant to an authorisation.  The Act defines "necessary" as necessary for the purpose of the prevention or detection of serious offences or in the interests of the security of the State.</p>  <p>  I can, however, assure the Deputy that there is a comprehensive legislative regime in place to deal with lawful interception.  Under Section 2 of the 1993 Act, Ministerial authorisation may be given for interceptions in the interests of the security of the State or for the purpose of criminal investigation.  Such authorisations are only issued following application from the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, in accordance with the Act.</p>  <p>  The 1993 Act also makes provision for independent judicial oversight of its operation by a serving Judge of the High Court who is designated for this purpose.  The Designated Judge reports at least annually to the Taoiseach on the operation of the legislation and these reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The current designated judge is Mr Justice Paul McDermott.  The Act also provides for a complaints mechanism whereby an individual who believes he or she has been the subject of an authorisation under the relevant provisions of the Act may apply to the independent Complaints Referee for an investigation into the matter.  The Complaints Referee is Judge John Hannan of the Circuit Court who may be contacted at the Office of the Complaints Referee, &Aacute;ras U&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh, Inns Quay, Dublin 7.</p></reply>

While significant efforts are devoted to addressing the issues referred to by the Deputy, it is important to note that the system of fixed charge notices and penalty points have formed a key part in Ireland's Road Safety Strategy for several years, have gained widespread acceptance, and contributed to enforcement and reduced road fatalities.  The system represents an efficient means of dealing with road traffic infringements with most fixed charges being paid without recourse to court, and an approximate payment rate of nearly 80% in 2014.</p>  <p>  The systems involved are, however, large and complex ones requiring continuous attention and development.  The issues of concern referred to by the Deputy are being addressed by the Criminal Justice Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) Working Group on a number of fronts.  These include the  project which is underway to introduce a '3rd Payment Option' whereby a person served with a summons would have a final opportunity to pay the penalty and receive the points without attending Court.  The IT project to give effect to this facility is due for completion in July 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition, a working group has been established by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to actively examine how the rate of summons serving can be improved and to regularly monitor the level of summons service throughout the country, as well as to consider longer term solutions with a view to improving service of summonses generally.  This group has reported improvements in the rate of successful service of summonses.  As the Deputy will be aware there are long-standing challenges with effecting service of summons in certain circumstances, relating to such matters as inaccurate address data, persons moving address, or living in multi-occupancy dwellings or other settings which make service difficult.  In addition, certain persons will take steps to evade service. Similar difficulties are experienced by many other police forces.</p>  <p>  Further short term steps have been undertaken to improve enforcement of penalty point matters in the Courts.  These include:</p>  <p>  - A range of prosecutions are being brought for the non-production of driving licences in Court, with a view to ensuring that penalty points are applied whenever a conviction is recorded.  The outcome of these prosecutions and their impact will be assessed, including in relation to the most efficient means of bring such prosecutions on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  - A pilot project is underway to allow 2 Dublin courtrooms electronic access to the National Vehicle Driver File (NVDF) to check driving licences where a person found guilty of a penalty point offence does not produce their driving licence to the Court.  Again this will assist in ensuring that penalty points are applied where convictions are recorded.</p>  <p>  One longer term measure also under consideration is a project which will associate vehicle and driver records in order to achieve optimum penalty point endorsement as well as other benefits.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I received an update recently in relation to the development of this project and hope to be in a position to provide further information in this regard in the near future.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that there is ongoing liaison between all of the stakeholders involved at an operational level with a view to addressing the above issues and any other matters that arise, including in the development of road traffic legislation.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na make full use of the extensive range of legislation which is in place to address street crime and anti-social behaviour, including knife crime and drug related crime.  In this regard there is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place with respect to knife crime including strong Garda powers to search without a warrant and  penalties of up to five years imprisonment.</p>  <p>  Tackling this type of crime is central to the overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate.  As part of the Garda Plan a range of dedicated policing operations and measures are in place to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour in the city centre.  The resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; are of course key components in providing visible policing in the city centre and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Garda responses, I am sure the Deputy would concur that the issues involved are not simply policing ones.  He will also recall that I have previously met with the key state agencies and other stakeholders in relation to various actions which are aimed at improving the general environment in Dublin City Centre, and strongly support this ongoing work.</p>  <p>  In relation to the concerns which have been expressed about drug misuse in the city centre, the Deputy will be aware that the Government's overall response to the problem of drug misuse, is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016.  The Strategy is being delivered under the stewardship of my colleague, Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and it provides a coordinated and comprehensive response founded on a partnership approach.</p>  <p>  I think it is generally accepted that the complex issues which contribute to drug addiction and related behaviours must be addressed in a coordinated and cross-cutting manner.  In response to the particular issues arising in Dublin City Centre a multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.  These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader aspects of the problems referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Finally, I welcome the continued close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council and other agencies as well as ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, such as the Dublin City Business Forum.  My Department is maintaining contact with these cooperative initiatives, and I understand that positive feedback is being received in relation to the policing measures being employed by the Garda authorities, and their level of engagement  with business and community interests.</p></reply>

I also referred the Review Group's report to the Joint Committee in November 2014 for their consideration and appreciate their feedback in this regard.  While there is much in common between both reports there are some variations in approach but these can be examined as part of the ongoing process of implementation.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Review Group contains 43 recommendations, some of which can be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a more long term approach.  As an initial step, in November 2014 I obtained the agreement, in principle, of Government to proceed immediately with the implementation of the following key recommendations:</p>  <p>  - bringing forward legislative proposals to establish the Parole Board on an independent statutory basis;</p>  <p>   - preparing proposals and options for Government on reform of sentencing policy, including a review of the threshold at which presumptive minimum sentences in drugs and other offences apply;</p>  <p>  - preparing proposals for Government on legislating for the Review's recommendation that Courts set out in writing their reasons for imposing a custodial sentence;</p>  <p>  - preparing proposals on the potential for increased use of earned remission; and</p>  <p>  - pursuing options for an open prison for female offenders.</p>  <p>  Progress has already been made in terms of some of the recommendations of both groups - for example, the pursuit of alternatives to custody, interagency working between the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service and the use of structured temporary release programmes such as the Community Return Programme and the Community Support Scheme.  The progress to date provides a solid platform from which to proceed with future reform.</p>  <p>  Finally, I established an implementation group to oversee implementation of these recommendations and to report back to me on a regular basis.  The group is chaired by Dr. Mary Rogan who was a member of the review group and I anticipate receiving the implementation group's first report next month.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-20a.96.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000060#WRC00600"><p>I can assure the Deputy that I am extremely conscious of the impact of burglary on communities throughout the country and am determined to continue to take strong action against the criminals involved.  My response to burglaries, and to crime generally, is focussed on two key objectives; strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I called together the heads of all of the Criminal Justice agencies to devise a new approach to tackle burglaries.  One important factor which emerged was the finding that a large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders.  Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.  Targeting these repeat offenders must be a priority and has the potential to significantly reduce the number of burglaries being committed.  In response, I introduced the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill which is targeted at those repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  The new Bill will require the District Court to provide for consecutive jail sentences where a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences, and will allow Courts to refuse ball for offenders who have a previous conviction for domestic burglary coupled with two or more pending charges.  This Bill, which I hope to see enacted in the next few weeks, will go a long way in giving the Courts the power to ensure that repeat burglars are kept off the streets.</p>  <p>  Legislation on its own is not enough, however.  I am also in ongoing contact with the Commissioner with a view to ensuring that the policing response is as effective as can be and that Garda operations take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.</p>  <p>  The Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which has led to 14,672 arrests, and 8,358 charges brought to date.  I am providing the Commissioner with the means to enhance this operational response.  Most significantly, last September we reopened the Garda College to new recruits for the first time since 2009.  To date, 400 new Garda&iacute; have started their training, with the first 295 having already passed-out and are now working in communities nationwide. 150 more recruits are due to enter Garda College in coming weeks, and, following the Budget Day announcements, there will be a further 600 new recruits in 2016, underlining the Government's commitment to providing communities throughout the country with the reassurance that comes from a visible and determined police force.</p>  <p>  I am also ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary vehicles and technology to respond to the highly-mobile gangs behind much burglary offending.  We have invested nearly &euro;29 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with 370 new vehicles coming on stream so far this year.  I have also made specific funding available for specialised vehicles and technology, providing &euro;700,000 for new high powered vehicles in 2015, and &euro;1.75m to upgrade surveillance equipment on Garda aircraft.  Looking to future years, the Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 makes provision for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles as well as very significant investment in new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to an investment of &euro;205m over the life of the Plan.</p>  <p>  With the benefit of the very significant allocations which the Government is making for Garda resources, I am working closely with the Commissioner to finalise details of an enhanced operational response to burglaries and related crimes, and I expect to be in a position to make further announcements in this regard shortly.  These measures represent an investment in the safety of our communities and underscore the commitment of this Government to ensure that those on the frontline in tackling crime, including burglary, have the capacity to do so effectively.</p></reply>

The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.</p>  <p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  This system is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much support the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information on sentencing via the website.</p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.  However, the majority of the Review Group took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the judiciary and does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.  It might also be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published in June 2013.  Work is currently underway to implement some of the key recommendations of the Penal Policy Review Group including preparing proposals and options for Government on reform of sentencing policy.</p></reply>

People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  The reasons for this are complex, and include level of education and skills, fears around loss of benefits, employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health.</p><p>The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p>The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work</p><p>- Make work pay</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support</p><p>- Engage employers</p><p>Implementing the Strategy will require continuing interdepartmental cooperation and a joined-up approach to supports and services for jobseekers and workers with disabilities.

I am very pleased to inform the Deputy that this Strategy was launched on Friday, 2 October 2015.</p><p>The Strategy sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to, work are supported and enabled to do so.  People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  The reasons for this are complex, and include level of education and skills, fears around loss of benefits, employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health.</p><p>The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p>The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work</p><p>- Make work pay</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support</p><p>- Engage employers</p><p>Implementing the Strategy will require continuing interdepartmental cooperation and a joined-up approach to supports and services for jobseekers and workers with disabilities.  The implementation of the Strategy will be subject to regular monitoring, and there will be a review and renewal every three years.</p></reply>

In its review of the Garda Station Network, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.  Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual  Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  In the context of this dynamic model of resource allocation it is not possible to give a break down of Garda resources in the manner requested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This included a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.</p>  <p>  On foot of this review, I published the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, 2015 which targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending.  The key objective of this legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who prey on law abiding householders and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others.  As the Deputy is aware the detail of the legislation is currently before the Houses of Oireachtas for debate and I hope to have it enacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I am also in ongoing contact with the Commissioner to ensure that we maximise the enforcement of all relevant laws in this area, by providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the appropriate supports to take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.  In this regard, the Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which has led to 14,672 arrests, and 8,358 charges brought to date.  I am providing the Commissioner with the means to enhance this operational response.  The reopening of the Garda College for new recruits in September last year and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; during the current year clearly demonstrate the Governments commitment to supporting communities on the front line.  We are committed to ongoing Garda recruitment to further enhance our ability to confront criminals and protect the law-abiding majority.  150 more recruits are due to enter Garda College in coming weeks, and, following the Budget Day announcements, there will be a further 600 new recruits in 2016, underlining the Government's commitment to providing communities throughout the country with the reassurance that comes from a visible and determined police force.</p>  <p>  In a modern context the provision of policing in rural areas must be focussed on highly mobile and flexible responses to crime patterns and the needs of communities.  This will be facilitated by the very significant investment in Garda vehicles and equipment including the &euro;700,000 for new high powered vehicles in 2015, and &euro;1.75m to upgrade surveillance equipment on Garda aircraft.  In all, we have invested nearly &euro;29 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with 370 new vehicles coming on stream already this year.  In addition, the future commitment to supporting an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in opposing criminals in all areas of the country is underscored by the Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 which makes provision for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, as well as very significant investment in new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to an investment of &euro;205m over the life of the Plan.</p>  <p>  With the benefit of the very significant allocations which the Government is making for Garda resources, I am working closely with the Commissioner to finalise details of an enhanced operational response to burglaries and related crimes, and I expect to be in a position to make further announcements in this regard shortly.  These measures represent an investment in the safety of our communities and underscore the commitment of this Government to ensure that those on the frontline in tackling crime, including burglary, have the capacity to do so effectively.</p></reply>

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence were asked to consider the content of that report, obtain the views of all relevant interested parties and make such report/recommendations as the Committee deemed proportionate and appropriate in the public interest to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to Government.  The Committee provided their observations to my predecessor in May 2013.  The Committee's response made a number of valuable suggestions to be considered in addressing this issue; it also noted that the advent of specific 'Cash for Gold' businesses was a relatively new phenomenon and that drafting legislation to regulate this sector would be complex.</p>  <p>  I am anxious to adopt the best approach to potential regulation in the area of cash for gold businesses, having regard to the potentially significant impact it would have on a broad range of other businesses in addition to 'cash for gold' outlets, including businesses such as jewellers, antique dealers, etc.  For that reason my Department has published a consultation document setting out potential options for addressing this issue.  In that context, the observations of the Committee were carefully examined by my Department and have significantly informed the drafting of this consultation document.</p>  <p>  This consultation document is available on my Department's website.

The section does not apply to investment or commercial properties.</p><p>The intention is to ensure that homeowners in mortgage arrears who are at risk of losing their homes are aware of, and have an opportunity to access, the legally protected debt resolution arrangements available under the Personal Insolvency Act, which may enable the borrower to remain in their home while resolving the debt in a sustainable manner.</p><p>The borrower may propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement following a court adjournment as indicated above, or through the main route set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  The Personal Insolvency Practitioner has a range of statutory responsibilities and duties, including advising the borrower on all their options so that they can make an informed decision, and (where a PIA is appropriate and the borrower so instructs) formulating and negotiating a PIA proposal on their behalf.</p><p>I should add that the recently enacted Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 presents additional options to borrowers struggling to resolve mortgage arrears on their homes, and particularly for those at risk of repossession.  It provides at section 21 for the introduction of a new review mechanism, if a borrower's proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, which includes their home mortgage, has been rejected by creditors. The borrower now has the option, in certain circumstances, of asking the Circuit Court to review the creditors' refusal.  Under this new provision, the Court will consider a range of tests set out in the legislation and has power to impose the proposed Personal Insolvency Arrangement on the creditors, where the Court considers appropriate.</p><p>The 2015 Act was signed by the President on 28th July, and the necessary changes to Court rules to bring the review mechanism into effect are currently being finalised by the Courts Service.</p><p>This important reform forms part of the Government Action Plan on strengthening support to those in mortgage arrears on their homes, announced on 13 May this year.  It is designed to ensure that fair and sustainable debt deals are upheld for  borrowers who want to work their way out of debt with a view to keeping their homes.  It will protect distressed mortgage-holders, and will provide a better balance between the interests of banks, and of those facing unsustainable mortgages.</p><p>I have no immediate plans to further amend legislation in this area, but will keep the operation of the law in this area under review. </p><p>Finally, I think that it is also important to reiterate the Government's message that independent help and advice is available to borrowers who find themselves in arrears on their homes and who want to reaching a solution to their difficulties: they should engage in this as early as possible, and should make contact with MABS, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, or with the Insolvency Service of Ireland.</p></reply>

This inquiry collects data from industrial local units and the results are published in the CSO&rsquo;s monthly release on &lsquo;Industrial Production and Turnover&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The results are in the form of an index of production and an index of turnover.  The release shows the monthly, quarterly and annual change in the production and turnover index; and it also includes a detailed breakdown by industrial sector.</p>  <p>  The production index is regarded as one of the most important measures of economic activity.  The main advantages of the production index compared with other indicators are its combination of early availability and its detailed breakdown.</p>  <p>  However, the short-term results from the Industrial Production Index are generally more volatile and do not always give a full indication of the trends in industry.  It is therefore important to take care when interpreting monthly or quarterly trends in the index.  For example, so far in 2015, the monthly change has ranged between an increase of 27.9% and a decrease of 11%.  Similarly, the reduction of 1% in August followed an increase of 9.9% in July.</p>  <p>  Such volatility reflects the production decisions taken by individual firms which represent a large share of industrial output &ndash; for example the product mix, pricing or stock changes taking place at a given time of year.  Annual changes in the index are generally more stable and provide a clearer indication of the trend in industrial production.</p>  <p>  Comparing August 2015 with August 2014, there was an annual increase of 18.5% in manufacturing production.  The breakdown between Modern and Traditional sectors showed an annual increase of 18.4% in the Modern sector and an increase of 4.7% in the Traditional sector.</p>  <p>  The Modern sector represents about 60% of the Industrial Production Index.  The sector comprises Chemicals and pharmaceuticals; Computer, electronic, optical and electrical equipment; Reproduction of recorded media; and Medical and dental instruments and supplies.  This sector accounts for most of the volatility in the short-term monthly results. </p>  <p>  The Traditional sector includes all other areas of manufacturing industry, the largest of which is the Food and Beverages sector.  The results for this sector are generally more stable, both in terms of the rate of growth and changes from month to month.</p></reply>

The money allocated for these grants is known as the Mediator Fund.  The Mediator Fund provides funding for an individual client up to a limit of &euro;500 in a 12 month period and provided the cost of the intervention does not exceed the limit no cost is incurred by the client.  If the cost of training or intervention is greater than the limit or the client has availed of other mediator funding within the year, which cumulatively exceeds the limit, the participant must meet the remainder of the cost.  This is agreed with the client at the funding application stage and is not reimbursable by the Department.  On completion of the training intervention, mediators review with the client the effectiveness of the support provided.</p>  <p>  Payments from the fund are generally made on a reimbursement basis upon production of valid receipts.  However, certain courses may require payment up front or a jobseeker may need to purchase certain tools or equipment to enable participation on a course.  In such cases the cost is met, in the first instance, by the LES who are in turn reimbursed by the Department.  The Department is not aware of any significant issues with these arrangements which have been operating satisfactorily for some time.  If the Deputy is aware of a particular case where difficulties have arisen I can arrange for my officials to investigate the matter.</p></reply>

These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal and Rights Commissioners are also covered by the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Where a person&rsquo;s former employer was a limited company, the company must be in liquidation or receivership in order for the person to be eligible to claim under the insolvency payments scheme.  In such circumstances, the liquidator or receiver becomes the relevant officer for submitting claims as he or she has access to the company records and can certify that the amounts claimed are in order.   </p>  <p>  There can be situations whereby employers have ceased trading without engaging in any formal wind-up process and some or all of their former employees are left with money owed to them.  Such people are not covered by the insolvency payments scheme.     </p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to review the position to establish what, if anything, can be done to progress payments to individuals in situations where employers cease trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process and owe moneys to their employees.  The Department is consulting a range of interested parties, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Revenue Commissioners, in respect of these issues.  Officials from the Department will continue to engage with all relevant parties to try to progress the matter.  There are very difficult legal issues that need to be addressed and the potential impacts that any proposed policy development might have must be considered. </p>  <p>  I am not in a position to indicate at this stage when the review will be completed.  We do not yet have a legal solution to it because there are all sorts of consequences that might flow from taking a legal position that was not carefully worked out. It could damage other people as well as addressing the problems faced by some people.  In addressing this, we must find a sensible and proportionate approach which does not have negative knock-on consequences for workers' other rights.</p></reply>

The Committee agreed that the Department of Justice and Equality should prepare a report for the Cabinet Committee, in conjunction with relevant Departments, on the practical implications of the Report's recommendations.  Each Department has examined the recommendations to determine timescales for implementation and any impacts and issues that may arise.  The Department of Justice and Equality is currently analysing the responses with a view to preparing a report for the Cabinet Committee.</p>  <p>  The direct provision allowance is a non-statutory payment administered by the Department of Social Protection on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The report recommended an increase in the rate of the direct provision allowance payment to both adults and children.  The recommendation will be considered by the Cabinet Committee in due course. </p>  <p>  There are currently approximately 1,160 children in respect of whom the direct provision allowance child rate is being paid.  The annual cost of increasing the direct provision allowance payment by &euro;5 for this number of children would be &euro;301,600.</p></reply>

The aim of the JobBridge Scheme is to give unemployed people an opportunity to secure work experience and to prove their competence to prospective employers.</p><p>As part of the advertisement process for JobBridge, the Department has robust screening and monitoring procedures in place.  Each Host Organisation must, inter alia, agree to the basic Terms and Conditions at the outset and before an application can be validated.  These include the requirements that the host organisation must have Public/Employers Liability insurance and Motor Insurance, if applicable, that will cover any interns on the JobBridge Scheme, and be fully compliant with current workplace Health and Safety and all other legal and sectoral requirements.  A Host Organisation cannot proceed beyond the application stage until it confirms compliance with the Terms and Conditions of the JobBridge Scheme.  Host Organisations must also ensure procedural and regulatory compliance in relation to placements that require Garda Vetting or other sectoral requirements.  In such instances, interns must agree to comply with requests for Garda Vetting and/or other sectoral requirements, where necessary, in accordance with the Host Organisation&rsquo;s policy.</p><p>It is also important to note that participation on JobBridge is not mandatory.  Jobseekers avail of JobBridge opportunities on a purely voluntary basis and there is no sanction of any kind if a jobseeker does not apply for or avail of JobBridge.  The Department has not and will not tolerate any abuse of the JobBridge Scheme or exploitation of participants.  There is a rigorous control and monitoring regime in place to mitigate the risk of misuse or abuse.  The Department also conducts regular monitoring visits to determine how individual internships are progressing.  Where abuses of JobBridge are found, they are dealt with as a matter of priority and appropriate remedial action taken.</p><p>Participants on the Gateway Scheme have a contract of employment for 22 months with the relevant city or county councils and class A PRSI contributions are paid on their behalf.  Gateway participants are covered by the Public/Employers Liability insurance of the relevant authority with which they undertake the work placement.</p><p>The Deputy makes reference to the use of JobBridge in Donegal by a company subcontracted by the HSE.  According to the Department&rsquo;s records, this company has provided a total of six internship positions in Donegal, five of which have already finished and one which is currently ongoing.  Of these six internships, all have been in the area of administration, including four as File Manager/General Office Administrator and one each as Office/Payroll Administrator and Receptionist/Office Assistant.  We have no details of JobBridge internships in Donegal as care workers for this host organisation.</p></reply>

This means that a &euro;0.01 increase in weekly earnings of &euro;352 attracts a weekly PRSI charge of &euro;14.08.</p><p>The introduction of the PRSI Credit will address the &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; by reducing the actual amount of PRSI charged, for those earning between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424 in a week.  At weekly earnings of &euro;352.01 the maximum PRSI Credit of &euro;12 will reduce the PRSI charge payable from &euro;14.08 to &euro;2.08.</p><p>As gross earnings increase, the PRSI Credit is withdrawn on a tapered basis.  This ensures that the amount of PRSI actually charged will increase in a progressive manner as gross earnings increase.  At gross weekly earnings of &euro;424, the tapering of the Credit has exhausted and the PRSI charge at 4% applies. </p><p>It is estimated that the introduction of the PRSI Credit will benefit 88,369 employments.  The benefit for individual employees depends on the level of their weekly earnings.  The following table details the numbers of employments and the extent of their weekly gains, at different income bands.<table><tr><th>Weekly Income band</th><th>Number of Employments</th><th>Range of Weekly Gains</th></tr><tr><td>352-&amp;lt;355</td><td>3,863</td><td>&euro;11.50 - &euro;12.00</td></tr><tr><td>355-&amp;lt;360</td><td>8,004</td><td>&euro;10.67 - &euro;11.50</td></tr><tr><td>360-&amp;lt;365</td><td>6,021</td><td>&euro;9.84 - &euro;10.67</td></tr><tr><td>365-&amp;lt;370</td><td>5,664</td><td>&euro;9.00 - &euro;9.84</td></tr><tr><td>370-&amp;lt;375</td><td>6,098</td><td>&euro;8.17 - &euro;9.00</td></tr><tr><td>375-&amp;lt;380</td><td>5,955</td><td>&euro;7.34 - &euro;8.17</td></tr><tr><td>380-&amp;lt;385</td><td>5,716</td><td>&euro;6.50 - &euro;7.34</td></tr><tr><td>385-&amp;lt;390</td><td>6,103</td><td>&euro;5.67 - &euro;6.50</td></tr><tr><td>390-&amp;lt;395</td><td>6,779</td><td>&euro;4.84 - &euro;5.67</td></tr><tr><td>395-&amp;lt;400</td><td>5,497</td><td>&euro;4.00 - &euro;4.84</td></tr><tr><td>400-&amp;lt;405</td><td>7,176</td><td>&euro;3.17 - &euro;4.00</td></tr><tr><td>405-&amp;lt;410</td><td>9,486</td><td>&euro;2.34 - &euro;3.17</td></tr><tr><td>410-&amp;lt;415</td><td>4,133</td><td>&euro;1.50 - &euro;2.34</td></tr><tr><td>415-&amp;lt;420</td><td>4,515</td><td>&euro;0.67 - &euro;1.50</td></tr><tr><td>420-&amp;lt;424</td><td>3,359</td><td>0.00 - &euro;0.67</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short, also provides for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.  A PSC is issued following the SAFE registration of an individual involving verification of their identity including capture of a photograph and signature.  The PSC is designed to replace other cards in the public sector such as the free travel pass and the social services card of the Department and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers. </p>  <p>  Sections 263 and 263(A) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) provide the legislative basis for the issue, use, cancellation and surrender of the PSC.</p>  <p>  There is no generic mandatory requirement for a citizen to carry a PSC or to produce one on demand.  However, the State has elected that certain publicly provided services may only be made available to people in possession of a PSC.  This improves the efficiency of the delivery of these services, makes them easier to access, significantly reduces the incidence of fraud and error and considerably reduces the potential for forgery.</p>  <p>  All new applicants for a PPS Number as well as all new and existing social welfare claimants are statutorily obliged to satisfy the Department as to their identity.  In practical terms, this entails going through the SAFE registration process.  Sections 262, 263 (B), 241 and 247(C) of Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 are relevant in this regard.</p></reply>

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2015 Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;89 million on the farm assist scheme which will benefit around 9,000 farmers with around 11,000 dependants each week.     </p>  <p>  All recipients of farm assist benefitted from the Christmas Bonus in December 2014 and will do so again this December.  All recipients with children are benefiting from the increase in child benefit announced in both Budget 2014 and Budget 2015.  </p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 have brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons.  However, farm families with the lowest income will be least affected by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist have been maintained.  </p>  <p>  The assessment of means for the farm assist scheme is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, farm assist is a flexible payment.

Prior to 2015, while the income and gains arising in an AMRF could be drawn down, the initial capital invested (a maximum of &euro;63,500) could not be accessed (except to purchase an annuity) until the owner of the AMRF reached age 75.  From 2015 onwards, an individual may draw down a maximum of 4% of the value of an AMRF annually.   </p>  <p>  When the owner of an AMRF reaches age 75 the AMRF is automatically converted to an ARF and the owner is then free to draw down the monies therein subject to taxation.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a Qualifying Fund Manager (QFM) who manages an ARF is required under section 784A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to treat a withdrawal from the fund as a payment of emoluments in the year in which the payment is made and to subject that payment to income tax under the PAYE system.  The fund manager is obliged to deduct tax at the higher rate of income tax for the year in which the payment arises (40% for 2016) unless Revenue has issued a certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point for the individual prior to the payment being made.  USC would also be payable on any payments at the reduced rates applying to the over 70s (1% and 3% for 2016).  </p>  <p>  In this context, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the individual in question should apply to her local Revenue Office for a certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point in advance of withdrawing monies from her ARF.  This will ensure that any such withdrawal is taxed at the individual's appropriate marginal rate of tax.  To that end, she can contact Ms Suzanne Sheahan, Kerry District, Government Offices, Spa Road, Tralee, County Kerry Tel:066-7161000.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible to state with certainty what rate, or rates, of income tax will apply to amounts that this individual might withdraw from her ARF, as this will be determined by the amount of her income from all sources (including any amount withdrawn from the ARF) and her tax credits for the year or years in question.  However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for 2016, the first &euro;33,800 of income will be taxed at 20%, with the balance being taxed at 40%.   </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioners, that in the event that tax is charged in the first instance at the higher rate (in the absence of a tax credit certificate) in circumstances where the standard rate (20% for 2016) applies to some or all of the payment, a taxpayer can apply to Revenue for a repayment of any tax overpaid after the end of the tax year in question.   </p>  <p>  The individual could, of course, consider staggering the withdrawals from her ARF over a number of years so that tax is restricted to the standard 20% rate on any withdrawal.  Indeed, to that end, she might also consider availing of the option to withdraw the maximum allowable 4% of the value of her AMRF in 2015 (which would be subject to tax and USC on the same basis as outlined above).    </p></reply>

Subsection (2) of section 784A exempts income and chargeable gains arising in respect of assets held in an ARF from income tax and capital gains tax.  These exemptions apply regardless of whether the ARF provider is an insurance company.  </p>  <p>  As regards the second part of the Deputy's question,  the appropriate UK treatment under the Ireland/UK Convention of income and gains from UK property of an ARF that is not managed by an insurance company is a matter that is under consideration by her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Following that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies.   </p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner.  This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that any required processes or procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.  </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act.   </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process.  When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions.  It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period.  Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations.   </p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed.  It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations.  The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter.    </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it has now contacted all credit unions inviting them to attend upcoming information seminars being held around the country from mid-November to end-November.  These seminars will provide credit unions with the opportunity to engage with the Central Bank on the new regulations and to discuss development of the credit union business model, including any changes to the regulatory framework that might be required to facilitate those developments.    </p>  <p>  The purpose of the International Credit Union Regulators' Network (ICURN) review was to assess the performance of the Central Bank's performance of its regulatory functions in relation to credit unions.  The review included a number of recommendations for refinements under the 3 broad areas: Supervisory Approach; Communications and Guidance; and Resources.  Under the heading Communications and Guidance, ICURN also suggested that consideration be given by the relevant authority to directing a review to evaluate the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.  ICURN further stated that this is not a matter for the Central Bank.  As Minister for Finance I have no plans at this time to carry out such a review.  </p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.    </p></reply>

The amount of credit due accumulates automatically as each set of works is carried out and the associated application is entered.  In addition, this method of application was designed to support fully tax compliant builders and move activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy, as all expenditure and relief claims have to be registered electronically.  In order to provide further support for both individuals and contractors applying under the HRI, a number of guides and videos were published on the Revenue website to demonstrate the process necessary.  </p>  <p>  As of 30 September 2015, 37,992 works, carried out on 27,422 properties by 6,117 contractors have been registered on the system.

These dates are used for different purposes and are mutually exclusive.  Firstly, the date of death of a disponer is the date by reference to which the Group Thresholds and tax rates are determined.  The Group Threshold is the value below which a gift or inheritance is not liable to tax in a given class of relationship such as parent to child.  Therefore, whatever thresholds and rates are in force on this date apply for the purpose of taxing the value of an inheritance. These rules are based on statute and are strictly applied.    </p>  <p>  Secondly, the date on which probate or administration is granted is generally used as the 'valuation date'.  This date has no effect whatever on the applicable Group Thresholds and tax rates.  The valuation date is the date on which the market value of the assets/property comprising the inheritance is established.  This market value is then compared to the relevant Group Threshold and the tax rate applied as appropriate on any excess of the market value over the threshold.  This date also determines when any inheritance tax must be paid and a tax return must be submitted to Revenue. </p></reply>

Following that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies.   </p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner.  This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that any required processes or procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.  </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act.   </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it has now contacted all credit unions inviting them to attend upcoming information seminars being held around the country from mid-November to end-November.  These seminars will provide credit unions with the opportunity to engage with the Central Bank  on the new regulations and to discuss development of the credit union business model, including any changes to the regulatory framework that might be required to facilitate those developments.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of additional services, where a credit union wishes to provide such services to its members, in addition to the services that are provided for under the Credit Union Act, 1997 (1997 Act), an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48 to 52 of the 1997 Act.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that since 2010 it has received less than 10 applications for approval of additional services under sections 48 to 52 of the 1997 Act.  These have all been received in recent months and are currently at a various stages of the approval process.</p>  <p>   The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. </p></reply>

In addition, the estimate included cases classed as Schedule D where most of their gross income is non-PAYE.  Some of these cases may have been availing of the PAYE credit.  The estimate did not take into account the ability of the credit to be fully absorbed.  On this basis it was estimated that the credit would be available to approximately 284,600 cases.   </p>  <p>  The estimated cost to the Exchequer of the &euro;550 Earned Income Credit (EIC) was calculated on the basis that it would be only available to taxpayers earning self-employed trading or professional income under Cases I, II and III of Schedule D and to business owner/managers who are ineligible for a PAYE credit on their salary income.  This cost is also based on an assumption that where a person may qualify for both a PAYE Credit and an EIC, the maximum credit available will be &euro;1,650.  </p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that the March costing was based on estimated incomes for 2015.  Pre-Budget costings are on the basis of estimated incomes for 2016. This should also be considered when comparing the two.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note the reply to his PQ, No. 65 of 1 October, which estimated the cost of introducing an Earned Income Credit of &euro;1,650 for self-employed people at &euro;137 million.  For the purposes of this estimate, as specified in the response, it was assumed that the credit would only be extended to cases identified to be in receipt of Trading or Professional (Case I or Case II) income, and not currently in receipt of the PAYE credit.  The estimate did not take into account the ability of the credit to be fully absorbed.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of persons who are projected to benefit in 2016 from the introduction of an earned income tax credit, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on the approach outlined above to estimate the cost to the Exchequer of the &euro;550 Earned Income Credit (EIC), it is estimated that this credit would be available to approximately 111,600 cases. </p></reply>

It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable for USC at all from next year.  The entry point to the USC was &euro;4,004 when I came into Government and this is my third occasion to increase the entry point - it was increased to &euro;10,036 with effect from 2012, and to &euro;12,012 from the tax year 2015.</p><p>The increase in the entry point was just one element of a package of measures designed to reward work.  </p><p>The reform of the USC system which saw the bottom three rates reduced by between 0.5 and 1.5 percentage points, the decision to accept the proposals of the low pay commission and increase the minimum wage by 50 cent per hour from the 1<sup>st</sup>of January, the increase of the Family Income Supplement, the introduction of the PRSI credit for low earners and the increase in Child Benefit were key elements of this package of measures.  </p><p>Looking at package as a whole, I think that we struck the correct balance and that keeping 700,000 individuals, or 29% of income earners, exempt from the charge was appropriate.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the numbers liable to USC are not constant and are affected by economic conditions generally.  As the economy continues to improve, incomes increase and new jobs are created.  These factors have the effect of increasing the numbers earning in excess of the entry point to the USC, and thus more income earners are brought within the scope of the USC.</p><p>The changes announced in Budget 2016 will see all those who pay USC in 2015 benefitting from a reduction in their USC bill next year for the same level of income.</p></reply>

For example, Revenue uses data it receives from the Department of Social Protection in relation to child benefit, together with other data from Revenue's own records, to automatically grant the credit each year.  In 2015, I am advised that Revenue gave the relief automatically to approximately 81,000 taxpayers on this basis.  Revenue also pre-populates the annual tax returns of self-assessed taxpayers with the Home Carer Tax Credit where it was claimed in the previous year.

This credit is available for works done to a principal primary residence, but would not apply to works carried out in a communal area in an apartment block, which would generally be covered by management fees payable by the owner occupiers.</p>  <p>  Grant assistance is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-20a.430.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000066#WRJ00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262, 268 and 270 together.</p>  <p>  Firstly it must be pointed out that NAMA does not own property, and it is not a builder or a developer, nor has NAMA chosen to become one as the Deputy suggests.  NAMA's role in relation to property is, like a bank, that of a secured lender.  As set out in Section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA's mandate as a secured lender is to achieve the best financial return for the State from the management and sale of its acquired loans and the assets underlying those loans.   The provision of development finance to enhance the ultimate disposal value of assets securing NAMA's loans is entirely consistent with this mandate and NAMA has already advanced over &euro;1.3 billion on a commercial basis across a range of commercial and residential development projects in Ireland since its acquisition of loans in 2010.   </p>  <p>  Aside from the fact that NAMA is a secured lender, rather than a developer, the Deputy is also not correct in suggesting that NAMA's focus in this respect has been solely on commercial property development. Last year, NAMA funded the delivery of nearly 50% of new housing output in Dublin despite having an exposure to less than one-third of residentially zoned development land in Dublin and since the start of 2014 has funded the construction of over 2,000 new houses and apartments in the greater Dublin area. In conjunction with last week's budget, NAMA announced that having carried out a review of residential development sites under the control of its debtors and receivers, it is aiming to fund the delivery of a target 20,000 additional new homes before the end of 2020.  This is in addition to NAMA's ongoing and central role in facilitating the delivery of new commercial and residential space in the Dublin Dockland's SDZ.   </p>  <p>  Development projects are managed by NAMA debtors, receivers or third-party partners. To achieve the 20,000 target, NAMA will, for instance, work with existing debtors, where possible, but will also work on a commercial basis with developers with no current links with NAMA in developing lands securing NAMA loans. It will seek out Joint Venture and partnership arrangements to ensure that a broad range of developers and contractors have an opportunity to contribute to the residential delivery programme. NAMA ensures in this context that all funding, in accordance with Section 10 of the NAMA Act to obtain maximum return to the State, is based on market commercial terms and that projects are commercially viable.  NAMA's role in funding projects is no different therefore to that of other commercial financial institutions and banks. The Deputy will also know that under the terms of the EU Commission's State Aid approval of the NAMA scheme in 2010, NAMA reports to the Commission and the Competition Authority each year on the use of its powers under the NAMA Act in the previous year.</p>  <p>  To the extent that it makes commercial sense to fund the development of projects under the control of its debtors and receivers, whether commercial or residential, NAMA is well placed to do so.   From its very outset, NAMA, through the NTMA, recruited staff with a diverse range of skills and experience from disciplines including banking, finance, law, insolvency, property development, asset management, architecture, engineering, surveying, planning, and construction.  As a result NAMA has the necessary resources, skills and experience, which were not available in the banks responsible for the pre-crash lending to the property sector, to successfully fulfil both its asset recovery and asset management mandates.  I am, as a result, fully satisfied that NAMA is best placed to bring coherence, direction and drive to the development of secured assets by its debtors, receivers and third-party investment partners.   I believe that anybody who takes the time to objectively consider the work that NAMA has already done in facilitating the delivery of new housing and new office space in the greater Dublin area, including the Docklands Strategic Development Zone (SDZ), will agree with that assessment.</p></reply>

For the tax year 2015, the rates of Income Tax are 20% and 40% and the rates of USC are 1.5%, 3.5%, 7% and 8%.  The first three rates of USC will fall to 1%, 3% and 5.5%, respectively, from January 2016. The rates at which tax and USC are charged is determined by the level of the individual's income for the year. In the case of individuals who have non-PAYE income that exceeds &euro;100,000 in a year, a USC surcharge of 3% applies to the excess. In relation to PRSI, the general position is that a 4% charge arises on the profit when the income is returned under Revenue's Pay and File system.</p>  <p>  Where the activity is carried on by a company, the income is currently charged to corporation tax at 12.5% if the company is carrying on the activity in the course of a trade. Otherwise, the rate of corporation tax for non-trading income is 25%.</p>  <p>  The rent-a-room scheme provides an exemption from Income Tax, PRSI and USC in relation to rent received where a person rents out a room or rooms in his or her principal private residence as residential accommodation and the rent received does not exceed &euro;12,000 per year. This scheme was introduced in order to encourage homeowners to rent out spare rooms in their homes, thereby increasing the supply of affordable rental accommodation. It applies solely to the provision of residential accommodation, i.e. where the tenant occupies the room(s) as his/her place of residence, and does not apply to short-term guest accommodation regardless of the whether or not the accommodation is provided via an on-line platform.</p>  <p>  I would remind the Deputy that persons offering short-term accommodation via online and offline platforms are competing with traditional B&amp;B and hotel accommodation providers, which are subject to regulation.</p></reply>

The Agriculture sector accounted for nearly a third of all loans. There was a strong regional spread of loans with 85% of all loans being granted to regionally based SMEs. The SBCI will publish a further update on its lending activities in January 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Government's aim for the SBCI is to enhance the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland, and thereby increase competition for SME lending.  The SBCI will achieve this by working with existing and new providers to develop specific funding products and by supporting new entrants to the SME lending market through allocating the remaining &euro;400m to a number of new and non-traditional SME finance providers for onward disbursement to the SME sector.  </p></reply>

The PPI Review included the sales by 11 credit institutions since July 2007. This resulted in a total refund of &euro;69.5 million (including &euro;6.1 million in interest). Around 83,490 policies have been refunded. I understand from the Central Bank that the projects in the 11 institutions are completed.</p>  <p>  As part of the overall PPI review, all consumers were written to by firms participating in the review giving them the opportunity to complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman if they were unhappy with the findings of the individual review of their PPI policy. I am informed by the Central Bank that it is continuing to engage with smaller entities that sold PPI including Credit Unions. It is expected that this review will conclude later this year. The objective of the review was to identify if there were instances where the Consumer Protection Code was not complied with in respect of the sale of PPI by credit institutions and where appropriate to remediate consumers. This Code, of course, continues to protect consumers of financial products sold by regulated financial institutions. </p></reply>

These include:</p>  <p>  - the extension of four measures which were due to expire at end December 2015 for a further three years. This includes the general stock relief, the stock relief for young trained farmers, the stock relief for registered farm partnerships and the stamp duty exemption for young trained farmers;</p>  <p>  - the introduction of a new succession transfer proposal. This new proposal is a model whereby two people, for example family members, enter into a partnership with an appropriate profit-sharing agreement and the provision for the transfer of the farm to the younger farmer at the end of a specified period, not exceeding ten years. To support this transfer, an income tax credit worth up to &euro;5,000 will be allocated to the partnership, split according to the profit-sharing agreement. The partnership model will enable a gradual transfer of control, facilitates knowledge transfer, and will provide extra income for the partnership. The purpose of this new model is to provide increased certainty about the timing of the transfer of a farm, which would greatly assist with long-term planning and farm productivity. This new incentive will be subject to state aid approval.</p></reply>

General rollover relief was abolished in Budget 2003. One result of rollover relief was that the CGT due on an asset disposal was often never paid. While the public finances are improving, it is still the case that the yield from the various taxes, including CGT, needs to be protected.</p>  <p>  An Agri-Taxation review was carried out last year, the objective of which was to maximise the benefits for the farming sector and the wider economy of the existing level of State support through the tax system. The report of the Review was published in the context of Budget 2015 in October last year. The Review bore Food Harvest 2020, among other things, in mind. It sets out a strategy for agri-taxation policy for the future and concluded that the three main policy objectives are:</p>  <p>  1.	Increase the mobility and the productive use of land</p>  <p>  2.	Assist succession</p>  <p>  3.	Complement wider agriculture policies and schemes, such as supporting environmental sustainability</p>  <p>  The Review made policy recommendations, taking into consideration the cost of the existing Agri-taxation measures that were already in existence and the need to protect the position of the public finances. Many of the recommendations made were introduced by way of last year's Budget and Finance Bill process including amendments to income tax land leasing reliefs, CGT Farm Restructuring relief and CGT retirement relief. I announced further measures on foot of the Review's recommendations in my Budget 2016 speech on Tuesday last.  However, the Review did not recommend change to the tax treatment of land disposed under a CPO.</p>  <p>  I note the concerns of the Deputy, and of landowners who have been subject to CPO. However, for the reasons outlined, I have no plans to introduce CGT roll-over relief in respect of gains on land disposed under CPO. I did, however, announce in my Budget 2016 speech that I am introducing a revised CGT entrepreneur relief from 1 January 2016 under which a lower 20% rate of CGT will apply to chargeable gains arising on the disposal of an individual's qualifying business assets (up to a lifetime limit of &euro;1 million). The revised relief will apply to disposals of qualifying business assets by farmers, among others.  </p></reply>

A Succession Farm Partnership is a succession planning model that encourages older farmers to form partnerships with young trained farmers and to transfer ownership of the farm, within a specified period, to that young trained farmer. This relief is available to any individuals, including families, who meet the qualifying criteria. </p>  <p>  The key terms of a Succession Farm Partnership are:</p>  <p>  -	Where a Registered Farm Partnership exists, where one participant is a farmer who owns land and the other participant is a young trained farmer, this partnership may become a Succession Farm Partnership. </p>  <p>  -	In general, there can only be two partners: an anchor farmer and a young trained farmer successor.  Where the anchor farmer's land was co-owned, or where the anchor farmer intends to pass the farm jointly to a successor and that successor's spouse or civil partner, then exceptions are made.</p>  <p>  -	The anchor farmer must agree to transfer the farm to the successor within 3 to 10 years of entering into the partnership.</p>  <p>  -	For the first five years of the partnership, or up until the successor reaches the age of 40, the partners are entitled to a 'succession tax credit' of &euro;5,000 per annum divided between them. This tax credit can only be used against the profits of the farm. The partners can apportion the tax credit between them based on relevant agreements. If the farm is not transferred as agreed at the outset, then this tax credit is clawed back.</p></reply>

The importance of agriculture in the Irish economy is well recognised. In this context, a specific relief from CAT is provided for gifts and inheritances of agricultural property once certain conditions are satisfied. This relief is known as Agricultural Relief. The aim of the relief is to ensure the active use of agricultural land. The relief takes the form of a reduction in the market value of the agricultural property by 90% for the purposes of establishing whether or not a CAT liability arises on the gift or inheritance and that relief remains in place.</p>  <p>  The tax-free thresholds above which CAT applies were reduced considerably over the period of the financial crisis and at a time of falling asset prices in order to help maintain the yield from capital taxes.  Asset prices, particularly property prices, have been recovering strongly although not to the levels experienced during the boom. In recognition of this recovery, I announced in my Budget Speech on Tuesday last an increase in the Group A tax-free threshold, which broadly applies to transfers between parents and their children, from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000.</p></reply>

However, I understand that public servants who began employment in a public service body prior to 1 April 2004 normally have a maximum retirement age of 65 under their terms and conditions of employment. For certain roles, such as members of the fire brigade or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the maximum retirement age may be lower. Public servants who have a maximum retirement age of 65 and have completed the applicable vesting period, are eligible to receive a public service pension and retirement lump sum upon retirement. The minimum pension age for such persons is normally 60 or 65 years of age.</p>  <p>  When a public service pension is integrated (or co-ordinated) with the Contributory State Pension (CSP), the public service pension amount paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the CSP. Where such a public service pensioner does not receive the CSP, or receives it only at a rate less than the maximum rate payable to a single person without dependants, then a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public service pension scheme.</p>  <p>  In such cases, the public service supplementary pension is only payable where the pensioner remains unemployed and, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for any relevant social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate. It is therefore necessary for the person to claim any available social welfare benefits, for example Jobseeker's Benefit, in order to receive a supplementary pension. This situation is not new and already applies to public service workers who have a maximum retirement age below 65, such as members of the fire brigade or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  This supplementary pension, subject to meeting the terms and conditions outlined, may be payable to persons required to retire from public service jobs at age 65 years. The rate of payment of the supplementary pension is the difference between the combined amount of the public service pension and any available social welfare pension received by the retiree, and the amount of public service pension he or she would have received if that pension had been calculated on a basis which was not integrated with the CSP.</p></reply>

Figures to the end of Quarter 3, 2015 are not yet available.</p><p>The number of applicants that were not approved as at 28<sup>th</sup>September 2015 was 449.  This excludes 234 applications which were withdrawn.  Different rates of interest is charged by MFI with 5% interest being charged for the Irish Best Young Entrepreneurs (IBYE) product and 7.8% interest being charged for applicants who are introduced through the Local Enterprise Offices and 8.8% interest being charged for direct applicants.  </p><p>MFI does not take any collateral in relation to the loans that it provides. However, in order to ensure a level playing field, for company structures MFI requires a personal indemnity from shareholders and/or directors.  The projected loan approvals due to be made available by MFI by the end of this year are &euro;12.3m.</p><p>The Deputy is aware of the review of the Microenterprise Loan Fund which was published in April 2015. This review contained a number of recommendations aimed at improving the operation and take up of microfinance in Ireland. In this connection, a new Scheme for the Microenterprise Loan Fund has recently been approved and removes the requirement for an enterprise to obtain a bank refusal before seeking funding from Microfinance Ireland. </p><p>I am confident that with the recommendations being implemented and a new MFI communications and marketing strategy in place that MFI will further improve the take up of its product.  This can already be seen through the most recent quarterly reports of MFI which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Details of such fees are set out below.</p>  <p>  Regulation (EC) 882 of 2004, relating to official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules, provides for the recovery of the cost of meat inspection services at approved meat premises.  The fees paid are mainly unit fees for animals slaughtered, ranging from &euro;5 for cattle to &euro;0.01 for small poultry.  It is important to note that these are the minimum amounts chargeable under the Regulation; and that they are not levies on farmers, but rather fees required by EU law to be recovered from meat plants.  The amount recovered in 2014 in respect of these fees was &euro;14.5m.</p>  <p>  The An Bord Bia Act, 1994, provides for payment to Bord Bia of a levy per head on slaughtered or exported livestock.  The current levy rate is &euro;1.90 per head for cattle.  There are no plans at this point to review the rate of the levy, which funds market research, intelligence and promotion activities and enables the beef sector to draw down co-funding from within the Bord Bia budget.  Income from the cattle levy (including live exports) in 2014 amounted to &euro;5.7m.</p>  <p>  Bovine disease levies are collected under the Bovine Disease Levies Acts 1979 and 1996 and are used as the industry contribution to compensation payable under disease eradication programmes.  The current rates are &euro;0.0006 per litre of milk processed and &euro;1.27 for each animal slaughtered or exported.  There are no plans at this point to review the rate of the levy.

This scheme replaces the former Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Less Favoured Areas Scheme. The ANC Scheme is worth &euro;195 million annually to some 100,000 farmers and in excess of &euro;1.3 billion over the life time of the Programme. The annual budget of &euro;195 million is in line with previous years funding and is focused on those farmers who are most actively pursuing a farming activity and contributing to the economic life of the rural areas where they farm.</p>  <p>  While horses are not eligible for the stocking density calculation under the ANC Scheme, the terms and conditions of the scheme do recognise the important contribution and role of horse breeding enterprises and accordingly set out that equine breeders who have met certain conditions are eligible for support.   </p>  <p>  Given the importance of breeds such as the Connemara Pony, and the challenges faced by breeders in ensuring their continued role in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s biological diversity, I have also sought to ensure that certain breeds are eligible for support under the Department&rsquo;s agri-environment Schemes. This was the case in both REPS and AEOS, and in securing agreement for GLAS under Ireland&rsquo;s new RDP, 2014-2020 I can confirm that targeted support is also included for Connemara ponies in the new programming period. The support rate available under GLAS is &euro;200 per livestock unit, up to a maximum of ten units.</p></reply>

In advance of the decision to include these actions, my Department consulted in the first instance with the Forest Service to secure best advice for planting and to ensure that appropriate conditions in relation to species and provenance are applied.</p>  <p>  The first tranche of GLAS proved hugely successful attracting nearly 27,000 applications in all.  On the basis of the commitments provided in the plans submitted with each of those applications, it is clear that we have met or exceeded our targets for the full RDP period in a number of areas. These include the planting of new hedgerows and traditional orchards. Given that these targets have been met in full it is proposed to suspend both actions for Tranche 2 of GLAS. In taking that decision, my Department has again consulted with the Forest Service on the availability of stock, and has also spoken directly with several suppliers. On foot of applications received under Tranche 1 alone, some 1,300 km of new hedgerows will be planted over the coming year or so, requiring the provision of 8 million plants, which will be a major boost to the sector. </p>  <p>  I should point out that these actions have simply been suspended for Tranche 2, not discontinued. I will review the position again for Tranche 3 in the light of uptake of remaining GLAS actions.</p></reply>

It must be noted that there is a decrease of almost 86% in the average annual level of correction for the 2013-2014 period relative to the correction for the 2008-2012 period. </p>  <p>  This proposal, which concludes the Clearance of Accounts process for the complete Single Payment Scheme, comes further to a prolonged process of intensive communication and effort by my Department and is a significant reduction from the original proposed exclusion of &euro;181 million. This outcome reflects positively on the work done in my Department and the very detailed case presented to the Commission in strong opposition to the original proposal, including the examination of over 900,000 land parcels throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  This outcome clearly illustrates the very positive impact of the 2013 LPIS review carried out by my Department, which identified ineligible lands and features incorrectly claimed by farmers during the scheme period 2008-2012. To date, this has resulted in the collection of &euro;1 million in disallowances in 2013 and &euro;3 million in disallowances in 2014.   </p>  <p>  The Commission proposal will now go forward to the Committee on the Agricultural Funds for consultation before the Commission makes a final decision, which is expected by mid to late November. The proposal, which is a complex and detailed document, is being scrutinised by my Department and discussions are currently ongoing in relation to the necessary funding with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

In 2005, my Department and the Department of Health completed a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which formalised arrangements for the provision of the inter-hospital air ambulance service by the Air Corps.  This SLA was renewed in October, 2011 and provides for inter-hospital transfer by air for patients with medical conditions that require urgent treatment at a hospital within Ireland or in the UK.  There has been a significant use of this service in recent years with 109 inter-hospital missions being completed in 2014, 102 in 2013 and 108 in 2012.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Air Corps also supports the HSE&rsquo;s Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service which operates on a daily basis out of Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This service commenced in June 2012 and was established, initially on a pilot basis, by agreement between my Department and the Department of Health in order to assess the level and type, if any, of dedicated emergency aeromedical support needed to assist the National Ambulance Service, primarily in the west of Ireland.  Following a report of an inter-agency EAS Establishment Group which looked at the various options for service provision, a permanent service has now been established following a Government decision in July 2015.  This is based on the Air Corps providing a dedicated helicopter operating out of Custume Barracks Athlone, with reserve support being provided by the Irish Coast Guard.  Whilst the Government's decision provided that the Air Corps' involvement in the service shall not exceed current levels in terms of the number of helicopters, it was also decided that the various options considered in the report are to be kept under review in the context of ensuring a sustainable long-term service arrangement.   </p></reply>

I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, at 31 August 2015, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,082, comprising 7,337 Army, 726 Air Corps and 1,019 Naval Service.   </p>  <p>  The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force, targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels. </p>  <p>  A total of 157 personnel have been inducted into the Army to date in 2015 from the panels formed from the General Service recruitment competition which was launched in March 2014.  The induction of a further 80 Recruits in the coming months will result in these panels being exhausted.  A new General Service recruitment campaign for the Army was launched on 4 August 2015.  The induction of successful candidates from this competition is expected to commence in early 2016. </p>  <p>  A recruitment competition for General Service Recruits for the Naval Service was launched on 6 March 2015.  The selection process for this competition is progressing and 40 personnel have been recruited from this panel this month.  It is planned that a further 40 will be recruited from the same panel in December 2015.  Air Corps General Service Recruits are drawn from the Army General Service Recruit campaign panels.   </p>  <p>  The intake of Cadets into the Permanent Defence Force is normally carried out on an annual basis taking into consideration the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and the resource envelope allocated to Defence.  10 Air Corps Cadets were inducted on 21 September 2015, 9 Naval Service Cadets were inducted on 22 September 2015 and 30 Army Cadets were inducted on 5 October 2015.   </p>  <p>  Direct Entry Competitions are held as required from which specialist appointments are filled.  To date this year, 24 Apprentice Trainee Technicians and 5 Engine Room Artificers have been inducted for the Air Corp and Naval Service, respectively. </p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.   </p></reply>

The Council Decision to launch the mission was adopted at the formal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 22 June 2015.  Ireland has not to date participated in this military mission.</p><p>The operation will be implemented in sequential phases and the first phase, to support the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling in accordance with international law, is completed.  The second phase involving the targeting, seizure and diversion of the vessels of human smugglers and traffickers is divided into two parts;</p><p>-  Part (i) to undertake these actions <i>on the high seas</i>under the conditions provided for by applicable international law, including UNCLOS and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants, and</p><p>-  Part (ii), in <i>accordance with any applicable UN Security Council Resolution or consent of the coastal State concerned</i>, to undertake these actions <i>on the high seas or in the territorial and internal waters of that State</i>, under the conditions set out in that Resolution or consent. </p><p>The third phase will involve taking all necessary measures against vessels including through disposal or rendering them inoperable.  No political discussions have yet taken place on the commencement of the third phase.  The requirement for UN Security Council Resolution or consent of coastal State also applies to this phase.</p><p>On 14 September, the General Affairs Council (GAC) adopted the assessment that conditions have been met to move to Phase 2 Part (i).  In accordance with the Council Decision of 18 May establishing the mission, the Political Security Committee (PSC) agreed the legal decision on 28 September to make the transition to Phase Two, Part (i).  </p><p>On 9 October, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2240, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising operations in the Mediterranean for a period of one year.  This resolution covers operations by the EU <i>on the high seas only</i>i.e. Phase 2, Part (i), and involves the targeting, seizure and diversion of the vessels of human smugglers and traffickers. </p><p>While Ireland is fully supportive of the EU approach to this crisis and reaffirmed its political support for the transition to Phase 2 Part (i) at these meetings, there are no plans to deploy naval personnel or vessels to the EU Mission at this time.  The LE Samuel Beckett will continue humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean in close co-ordination with the Italian authorities.  Following completion of her mission in early December, the operation will be reviewed in detail.  </p><p>The question of any future deployment and the nature of any such deployment will be examined in the context of the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean and the overall EU response thereto, the demands on the Defence Forces, our overseas commitments and available resources and the nature and mandate of the operation.  That said, I remain open to the possibility of further participation by the naval service in the Mediterranean next year if needed, subject to Cabinet approval.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.</p><p>At an operational level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively targets public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime through the strategic deployment of Garda resources.  In this regard, areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  In addition, Detective Units and Divisional Crime Task Forces may be utilised to provide a high visibility presence in areas such as late night bars, clubs etc, particularly when people are exiting, to deter and detect anti-social behaviour and possible altercations.  The resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of the first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; are of course key components in providing visible policing.  However, it should be noted that many knife crimes occur in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity, which increases the challenges for preventative policing and enforcement.</p><p>In relation to the investigation of specific knife-related crimes, I am assured that all appropriate resources, including any necessary technical and forensic facilities are employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to secure detections and identify perpetrators of these crimes.</p><p>In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved in a number of awareness measures relating to knife crime, and I understand that the Garda Schools Programme is utilised to include talks on knives and other weapons for secondary school pupils, emphasising the dangers involved and the need for care, vigilance and social responsibility. </p></reply>

The purpose of Mr. Murphy's examination was not to carry out an inquiry to establish all of the facts of the case at this remove but rather to advise on whether a case had been made which would warrant the granting of a pardon.  In this regard the statement I issued following the Government decision, which was prepared with the assistance of Mr. Murphy, sets out in detail the basis for Mr. Murphy's opinion that Mr. Gleeson's conviction was unsafe and fully and publicly outlines the basis for the Government's decision to recommend to the President that he exercise his right of pardon under Article 13.6 of the Constitution. <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system. </p>  <p>  The Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  I am mindful that all complainants are anxious to know the outcome of the review of their case and every effort is being made to conclude the process.  In each case a submission will be prepared. Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy will review the summary of the conclusion and the letter of notification drafted to ensure that they are a fair and accurate reflection of the recommendation. </p>  <p>  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June. To date, 216 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases. Letters will continue to issue to all complainants until the process is completed.</p>  <p>  The process of the Independent Review was not a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation designed to make findings.  The purpose of the review was to triage the complaints to establish whether there was any action which I could take to further resolution of that complaint.

Recommendations by counsel were based on a review of the papers, and did not involve interviews or interaction with complainants or any other form of investigation, although counsel could where necessary recommend that the Minister seek further information from persons or bodies.  The Panel was independent and therefore no restriction was placed on the nature of recommendations which they might make.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the review was to triage the complaints to establish whether there was any action which I, as Minister, could take to further resolution of that complaint.  Counsel were therefore required to consider the matters raised by the complainants and any corroboration offered by them, to take into account the actions already taken in relation to the complaint, and the possible options open to me, as Minister, to pursue matters.  Counsel were then required to use their knowledge and experience of the criminal law to recommend whether further action was either possible or appropriate and if so to recommend the relevant action for me to take.</p>  <p>  It is the case that in many instances the outcome has been that no further action was recommended.  This is to some extent inevitable in circumstances where, on the one hand, individuals have genuine but necessarily subjective concerns about how their particular cases were originally handled and, on the other hand, counsel have to consider whether those cases have been through due process, even if the persons involved remain unhappy with the outcome of that process.</p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur.  Where cases have resulted in recommendations for further action, including referral to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), requesting a report from the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 41(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, etc, I have accepted those recommendations. It is my intention, on the completion of the process, to make a comprehensive statement on all the actions I have decided to take in line with the recommendations of counsel.</p>  <p>  I have also asked counsel, in addition to making recommendations in individual cases, to produce a general overview of the issue and trends identified through this process. I believe that this may lead to recommendation for changes across a number of areas, which if implemented will address many of the general and thematic concerns raised by those persons who cases were examined by counsel. I understand that this general overview report is currently being finalised.  Once I have had an opportunity to consider it, I intend to publish it.</p></reply>

This includes the need for all such CCTV schemes to be authorised in writing by the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention, and as aids to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access such as town centres, fall into two categories: Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems.</p>  <p>  Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of the identified operational needs and priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of such systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner. The Garda authorities inform me that they keep the current Garda CCTV arrangements under ongoing review in the context of changing operational requirements. </p>  <p>  As regards community-based CCTV, a scheme was launched in 2005 which provided financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of a local community CCTV system.  Two rounds of funding were advertised under that scheme, most recently in 2007.  All of the funding provided under the previous two rounds has been fully allocated.   </p>  <p>  I am very conscious, however, of the value that communities place on CCTV and with this in mind, I have instigated a review of the effectiveness of the Community CCTV Scheme in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  The outcome of that review will inform future decisions on the continuation of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, has recently made an announcement in relation the provision of CCTV in rural areas, which is to be funded from the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. </p></reply>

The direct savings from the Programme as highlighted by the Deputy are modest.  However, it is important to recall that the primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>In its review of the Garda Station Network, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and  allows  front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.</p><p>In tandem with the rationalisation of stations this Government has been determined to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.  Since 2012, we have invested almost &euro;29 million in renewing the Garda fleet to support front line Garda responses. So far this year 370 new vehicles have come on stream including new specialised vehicles.  I have announced  today  the allocation of a further &euro;5.3m to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purchase of a further 260 vehicles between now and the end of the year.  This new investment will provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motor cycles for high visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing. This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue  under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan. The increased budget allocation for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.</p><p>This substantial level of investment will be accompanied by the continued renewal of Garda personnel with 600 new Garda to be recruited next year on top of the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year. The totality of this investment will ensure that Garda&iacute; have the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of highly-mobile criminal gangs and to disrupt crime, particularly burglaries, across both rural and urban communities.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among Units, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.</p>  <p>  This Government has been determined to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.

So far this year 370 new vehicles have come on stream including new specialised vehicles. Today I announced the allocation of a further &euro;5.3m to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purchase of a further 260 vehicles between now and the end of the year.  This new investment will provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motor cycles for high visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing. This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue  under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan. The increased budget allocation for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.</p>  <p>  This substantial level of investment will be accompanied by the continued renewal of Garda personnel with 600 new Garda&iacute; to be recruited next year on top of the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year. The totality of this investment will ensure that Garda&iacute; have the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of highly-mobile criminal gangs and to disrupt crime, particularly burglaries, across both rural and urban communities.</p></reply>

If someone re-offends on temporary release, the matter of their prosecution is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider.</p>  <p>  If the person is returned to prison to serve the remaining part of their sentence as a result of breaching their temporary release conditions, this information is kept on file and is taken into consideration by the Irish Prison Service for any future temporary release decisions that are taken in respect of that offender. Behaviour on temporary release is one of the criterion to be considered as outlined in the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.  The Irish Prison Service work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service in respect of the monitoring, supervision and compliance of those on temporary release.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 and the  Joint Prison Service/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2015-2017 includes working towards the objective of ensuring that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.</p>  <p>  The Community Return Scheme is an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners, serving sentences between 1 year and 8 years, can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting. The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.</p>  <p>  A recent report on the Community Return Scheme has showed that there were 232 persons released in the first year of the Scheme, from October 2011 to end September 2012. Of this group the report highlighted that as at the end of year 2013, 91% of those involved in the Scheme had not returned to custody.</p>  <p>  In addition to Community Return, a Community Support Scheme has also been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that they do not collate such information in the format requested by the Deputy.  However, the Irish Prison Service Recidivism study for 2008 shows that 1,809 persons out of a total of 5,489 that were released in that year went on to re-offend within the first 6 months of release. This figure also includes offences committed before their official release date and this would take account of crimes committed while on early release, day release, and compassionate release. It also includes offences committed while in custody such as assaults and possession of mobile phones.</p>  <p>  These figures were produced in partnership with the Central Statistics Office using a combination of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Irish Prison Service records, based on the Irish Crime Classification System (ICCS).  The study, which was published in December 2013, looked at the available data up to the end of 2011 to take account of the time to make a conviction and a broader 3 year analysis of recidivism.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the Recidivism study for the 2009 releases will be published in December 2015 by the Central Statistics Office.</p></reply>

This includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support frontline Garda&iacute; and intelligence led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the Commissioner as provided for under Section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out in the context of their annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.  The substantial additional investment of &euro;205 million in new technology and systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 will facilitate progress on further important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on Crime Investigation. Examples of the new systems to be developed through this investment include:</p>  <p>  -  new computer-aided dispatch to ensure responsive and coordinated deployment of Garda&iacute; in the community;</p>  <p>  -  mobile technology to give the Gardai secure mobile access to critical information when and where they need it;</p>  <p>  -  investigations management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations; and</p>  <p>  -  upgrading the  APNR to  enhance policing of road safety and compliance.</p>  <p>  In the area of forensics the situation is that the Garda authorities currently employ state-of-the-art automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  The Deputy will also be aware that the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be further enhanced by a new national DNA database, scheduled to become operational shortly.</p>  <p>  These and other new technological solutions will reduce the amount of Garda time involved in paperwork and will ensure that Garda&iacute; can spend more time engaged in front line policing.</p></reply>

I have requested the CSO to provide the available statistics directly to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I am in ongoing contact with the Commissioner to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources to take account of evolving crime trends and patterns, in particular with respect to the more serious crime categories.</p>  <p>  With the benefit of the increased resources which the Government is now making available, I am providing the Commissioner with the means to enhance the overall Garda operational response.  The reopening of the Garda College for new recruits in September last year and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; during the current year clearly demonstrate the Governments commitment to supporting communities on the front line. We have taken in 550 new recruits this year and, following the Budget Day announcements, there will be a further 600 new recruits in 2016, underlining the Government's commitment to providing communities throughout the country with the reassurance that comes from a visible and determined police force.</p>  <p>  I am also ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary vehicles and technology to carry-out more visible and responsive patrols of motorways and rural communities, with increased surveillance of criminal gangs and enhanced night-time public order policing in our cities and provincial towns. I have secured an additional &euro;5.3 million for the purchase of 260 Garda vehicles between now and the end of the year and, in total, we have invested nearly &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with 370 new vehicles already coming on stream so far this year.  In addition to the major investment in Garda vehicles I have also made &euro;1.75m available specifically to upgrade surveillance equipment on Garda aircraft. Looking to the future, the Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 makes provision for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles in the coming years, as well as very significant investment in new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to &euro;205m over the life of the Plan. The increased resources which are now coming on stream represent a very significant investment in enhanced policing and community safety in all areas.</p></reply>

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  These are the criteria for access to legal aid under the Act and there is no limit placed on the number of times that a person can apply for legal aid and the granting of such aid does not make a distinction between offences committed while on bail or otherwise. I have no function in relation to individual judicial decisions regarding the granting of legal aid.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if they cannot afford to pay for legal representation, there is a right to legal aid.

Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing or, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p></reply>

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.</p>  <p>  The Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  I am mindful that all complainants are anxious to know the outcome of the review of their case and every effort is being made to conclude the process.  In each case a submission will be prepared. Mr Justice Roderick Murphy will review the summary of the conclusion and the letter of notification drafted to ensure that they are a fair and accurate reflection of the recommendation.</p>  <p>  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June. To date, 216 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases. Letters will continue to issue to all complainants until the process is completed.</p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur.  While it would not be appropriate to publish individual recommendations, it is my intention, on the completion of the process, to make a comprehensive statement on all the actions I have decided to take in line with the recommendations of counsel.</p>  <p>  I have also asked counsel, in addition to making recommendations in individual cases, to produce a general overview of the issue and trends identified through this process. I believe that this may lead to recommendation for changes across a number of areas, which if implemented will address many of the general and thematic concerns raised by those persons who cases were examined by Counsel. I understand that this report is currently being finalised.  Once I have had an opportunity to consider it, I intend to publish it.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that the area in question is policed by both Castlepollard and Granard Garda sub-Districts. I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 31 August 2015 the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 4 Garda&iacute; assigned to Castlepollard and 27 assigned to Granard Garda stations.  The work of these Garda&iacute; is supported by 2 Garda Reserve members and 3 civilian staff.  The work of these Garda&iacute; is   augmented when necessary by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). Organised criminal activity is currently being targeted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across a number of fronts, including the use of focused intelligence-led operations by specialist units such as the Drugs and Organised Crime Unit and CAB. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality I am determined to tackle rural crime and to ensure that those on the frontline have the legislation and resources to do so effectively.  My approach is focussed on two key objectives; strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders, principally through the  Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, 2015, and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively through the significantly enhanced Garda resources which the Government is making available. </p>  <p>  Insofar as the specific policing measures in place to tackle burglary are concerned, the Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is the national operation targeting burglary using an intelligence and analysis-led approach.  This sustained Garda campaign against burglary, which incorporates burglary related Operations in each Garda Division has resulted in many successes in disrupting those involved in this type of criminality. As of 31 August 2015, Operation Fiacla had led to 14,381 arrests, with 8,181 charges being brought against suspects.</p>  <p>  I am also in ongoing contact with the Commissioner with a view to ensuring that the policing response is as effective as can be and that Garda operations take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.  In this regard, I have made specific funding available for new specialised vehicles and technology  to support an enhanced operational response by Garda&iacute; to current and emerging crime threats, including burglary offences being committed by highly-mobile gangs.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to the ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute;, and to this end the first intake since 2009 of new recruits commenced training at the Garda College, Templemore, in September of last year. To date there has been four intakes of Garda Trainees into the Garda College, giving a total intake of 400.  A further 150 recruits will enter the college by year end, bringing total recruitment of Garda Trainees to 550.  So far 295 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. On attestation, new Probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are deployed to mainstream policing duties. I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  The ongoing recruitment of new Garda&iacute; is crucial for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the safety of communities throughout Ireland and I was pleased to announce that the budget allocation for 2016 will allow for the further recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; in 2016.</p></reply>

The Commission proposed the establishment of an EU-wide resettlement scheme to offer 20,000 resettlement places by the end of 2016. Under the new resettlement scheme, specific numbers would be allocated to all Member States, calculated on the basis of a distribution key based on GDP, size of population, unemployment rate and past numbers of asylum seekers and of resettled refugees. The distribution key would also take account of the efforts already made on a voluntary basis by Member States. The Commission's calculation envisaged Ireland accepting 272 persons over the 2015/2016 period.</p>  <p>  Ireland had already committed to accept 220 persons over the 2015/16 period under its national resettlement programme.  In response to the Commission's proposals, the Government agreed to accept an additional 300 persons bringing the total to be admitted to 520 persons by the end of 2016.  Ireland is one of 27 states that participate in a refugee resettlement programme led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  The focus of the Irish resettlement programme in recent years has been on the resettlement of refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict who are living in one of the hosting countries in the region, for example those living in Lebanon, Jordan or Turkey.  NGOs working in cooperation with the UNHCR at a local level identify the most vulnerable persons for resettlement, regardless of their race, religion, nationality or ethnicity.  UNHCR then  proposes the cases to Ireland for consideration.  Self referrals or referrals by other organisations do not form part of this programme.  A letter was recently issued to this effect to the correspondent.</p></reply>

This Group reported to Government in July this year, setting out a range of options for future investment to enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years and after-school childcare.  Several recommendations of the Group, which relate to after-school childcare, were considered as part of the Estimate process for the Budget and will be funded in 2016. </p><p>These include a &euro;3 million capital fund, which will be provided to enable both community/not-for-profit and private providers to develop after-school childcare services using existing school and other accessible community facilities.  Work will also begin on the development of Quality Standards for After-School Childcare, along with a consultation with children on their views about after-school childcare. </p><p>These new developments add to the  range of programmes implemented by my Department to assist parents in accessing quality and affordable after-school childcare. These include:</p><blockquote>- The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme that provides after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  Eligibility for the programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school. The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods. In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.<br /><br />- The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.  The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks.  Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.<br /><br />- The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills.  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  </blockquote></reply>

Officials in my Department have contacted the child's parents and asked them to forward a request for a pro-rata exemption together with evidence of special needs  in order to enable the child to avail of the remaining 1 day per week over 27 weeks.</p></reply>

The Centre&rsquo;s budget for 2015 is set at &euro;90,453. </p>  <p>  Tusla's priority is that Family Resource Centres will have the capacity to provide modern and appropriate services for all children and families in the communities they serve. These services need to be reliable, responsive, sustainable and accessible to all.</p>  <p>  Tusla fully recognises the need for community-based family support services serving the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare. To that end, Tusla is working with the Centre and representatives from these communities to ensure that the funding currently available under the Family Resource Centre Programme is directed to the provision of a community-based service, one that is operating to its full potential and which best supports and promotes the development, welfare and protection of children, and the effective functioning of families.</p>  <p>  Consistent with this approach, it has been decided to establish a new Family Resource Centre in Kenmare to serve the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare. A new legal entity will be formed. The current Voluntary Board of Management  of Kenmare Community Care will be re-constituted. It will initially include community representatives from the Family Resource Centre referred to and Kenmare Community Care. </p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres are independent companies limited by guarantee and are managed by a Voluntary Board of Management which is representative of the local community. While Tusla funds the salaries of staff engaged by Family Resource Centres, each individual Family Resource Centres is responsible for the recruitment of employees and the terms and conditions under which they are employed. </p>  <p>  As Tusla is not the employer of Family Resource Centre employees, the Agency is not in a position to offer contracts of employment. However, in order to support the two employees in question, Tusla has asked the Regional Support Agency to explore at local level whether the staff can be facilitated when Kenmare Family Resource Centre is established.  Tusla has asked the Regional Support Agency to report back to it on this matter as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Of this funding, &euro;5 million was made available for grants specifically for community/not-for-profit early years services.  The remaining &euro;2 million was made available for both private and community/not-for-profit early years services to access grants of up to &euro;500 for quality improvement measures, specifically in the area of upgrading IT facilities.  </p><p>Capital funding of &euro;2.5 million was provided in 2014 for the maintenance and upgrade of community/not-for-profit early years services.  The objective of this funding was to ensure that previously-funded community/not-for-profit early years services remained fit-for-purpose. </p><p>&euro;2.75m was provided in Budget 2013 to support the on-going improvement of early years services.  Both private and community/not-for-profit services participating in one of the national childcare programmes implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs were eligible to apply for a grant under this Programme. </p><p>Finally, in Budget 2012, the Government announced capital funding of &euro;6m to fund a maintenance programme for early years services (i.e. to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work and to purchase equipment).

From September 2016, I am expanding the ECCE programme to allow children to access free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school.  There will be three intakes of eligible children during the pre-school year: children who reach the age of 3 between April and August can access the programme from September; children who reach the age of 3 between September and December can access the programme from January; and children who reach the age of 3 between January and March can access the programme from April. </p><p>The number of weeks of free pre-school a child will benefit from will depend on their birth date and on the age at which they start primary school. This number ranges from 38 weeks (for children born between April and August who start school at age 4) to 88 weeks (for children born between January and March who start school at age 5).  This equates to an estimated  23 additional weeks on average. The estimated average was derived by taking the average number of weeks a child will benefit from (i.e. 61 weeks) and deducting current entitlement (i.e. 38 weeks).  </p><p>Average number of pre-school weeks by month of birth and of enrolment in pre-school<table><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Average no. of ECCE weeks</th><th>Average no. of ECCE weeks</th></tr><tr><td>Birth Month</td><td>Enrolment Month</td><td>Start school age 4</td><td>Start school age 5</td></tr><tr><td>Jan - Mar</td><td>April</td><td>50</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>Apr - Aug</td><td>September</td><td>38</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Sep - Dec</td><td>January</td><td>61</td><td>61</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department estimates that the number of children benefiting from the ECCE programme will increase from 67,000 to over 127,000 in a given year.  This figure is based on population estimates (drawn from the Central Statistics), estimates on school starting age (drawn from the Department of Education and Skills), and the current rate of participation (i.e. 95% uptake).</p><p>The cost of this extended provision is estimated to be an additional &euro;47 million in 2016. This includes the cost of restoring capitation rates to providers to pre-2012 levels from September 2016.</p><p>As this initiative will begin in September 2016, the total additional costs of this extended provision - estimated to be &euro;112 million - will not be realised in full until 2017. This extended provision is estimated to result in 23 additional weeks of free pre-school for children on average. A full second year of pre-school (i.e. 38 additional weeks for all children) is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;175 million. </p></reply>

While developing these regulations a number of other necessary and practical matters were identified as being required, some of which are in the interests of consumer information.  These other matters include <i>inter alia</i>, text in a prescribed form to indicate the type and weight or number of tobacco products contained in the packet, the inclusion of a tab to allow consumers to reseal the pack and the inclusion of a calibration mark which may be necessary for the automated production of the packaging.  Amendments will be made to the 2015 Act to provide for regulation making powers for these matters.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p><p>Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  The vaccine is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme.  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p><p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.</p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting ().  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  </p><p>As of the 9 October 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 921 reports of suspected adverse reactions/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>918 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>3).  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA regarding both Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix vaccines to date have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information. </p><p>The EMA has commenced a review of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine &quot;<i>to further clarify aspects of their safety profile</i>,&quot; although the agency points out that this review &quot;<i>does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks</i>.&quot;</p><p>The HPRA is participating in the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee's (PRAC) review of HPV vaccines to clarify aspects of their safety profile.  As for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the PRAC (an EU level drug safety committee) where the HPRA is actively represented and contributes.</p><p>The current review will look at available data with a focus on rare reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS, a chronic pain condition affecting the limbs) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS, a condition where the heart rate increases abnormally after sitting or standing up, causing symptoms such as dizziness and fainting, as well as headache, chest pain and weakness).  Reports of these conditions in young women who have received a HPV vaccine have been previously considered during routine safety monitoring by the PRAC but a causal link between them and the vaccines was not established.  Both conditions can occur in non-vaccinated individuals and it is considered important to further review if the number of cases reported with HPV vaccine is greater than would be expected.  The outcome of the PRAC review is anticipated before the end of this year.</p><p>In addition the EMA is currently evaluating data from a on the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>.  The study conducted jointly by the French medicines agency (ANSM) and the French national health insurance fund (CNAMTS) compared the incidence of autoimmune conditions in girls given HPV vaccines with the incidence in girls not given the vaccines.  </p><p>The EMA have advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of these vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>in accordance with the current product information.</p></reply>

It is estimated that there are approximately 41,000 people with dementia in Ireland. This number is expected to rise to between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2014.  Given the increasing numbers of people with dementia, the Government committed to developing an Alzheimer's and other dementia's strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.  The Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This National Dementia Implementation Programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m.</p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>  -the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home Care Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p>  -the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GP's, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia. The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points etc;</p>  <p>  -measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme.  This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers and advocates. The Group also includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.  The most recent meeting of this Monitoring Group was held on 24th September 2015.</p>  <p>  As the delivery of dementia services is a matter for the HSE, I have referred your question to the HSE for direct reply. If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. </p></reply>

The charge for public in-patient services is &euro;75 per night, up to a maximum of &euro;750 in a calendar year. The Emergency Department charge is &euro;100 for each episode of care. Exemptions from these statutory charges are extended to certain cohorts including persons with full eligibility (medical card holders). </p>  <p>  All persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the statutory charges set out in the Fourth Schedule of the Act. </p>  <p>  Issues around performance in Emergency Departments (ED) are being addressed by the ED taskforce. It is important to note that patients are being actively cared for during their ED attendance, regardless of where they are accommodated. According to the most recently published HSE Performance Assurance Report (for July 2015), 70.2% of patients attending ED were either admitted or discharged within 6 hours and 83.6% of patients were admitted or discharged within 9 hours.  2.8% of patients were in ED for more than 24 hours.  These areas are a particular focus for hospitals and site specific plans are being prepared to improve performance. Each Hospital Group has implemented an escalation protocol for those patients whose wait time in ED is approaching 24 hours as part of the Winter Planning process.</p>  <p>  While there is continued focus on reducing the number of patients on trolleys, it is important to note that treatment trolleys are routinely used in day surgery procedures such as colonoscopy and that in the case of a chemotherapy or dialysis patient, best practice is to treat him\her in a seated or reclining position, on a therapy chair or a recliner, rather than on a bed.  </p></reply>

This allows the HSE in conjunction with the SCA to identify and analyse developing trends and patterns and to develop and implement risk mitigation strategies.</p><p>Considerable work has been undertaken in the first six months of 2015 in the roll out the new National Incident Management System (NIMS). At the end of June 2015, the former &lsquo;STARsWeb&rsquo; system was &lsquo;switched off&rsquo;. NIMS is now the national (and only mandated) platform for reporting incidents. It provides a powerful reporting tool that supports incident investigation, tracking of recommendations from investigations and analysis of adverse event trends, all of which should inform the risk strategies of each health service organisation. </p><p>In terms of the quality of data;</p><p>- This is supported by the NIMS intelligent interview entry forms, incorporating  specific questioning and picklists, along with mandatory field validations which are designed to standardise reporting across the health sector. This will also lead to improvement in data quality.</p><p>- Certain NIMS information is automatically generated by the system through built in algorithms. An example of this is the &quot;severity rating&quot; which is based on the injury outcome. This algorithm follows the Impact table for clinical and non clinical incidents, which is set out in the HSE&rsquo;s Safety Incident Management Policy, and results in the generation of an objective, system-driven &quot;severity rating&quot;.</p><p>- NIMS provides the capability for the user to conduct a risk investigation and update the injury outcome as appropriate, allowing for a reclassification of the system generated &quot;severity rating&quot;.</p><p>- The State Claims Agency, as the host of NIMS, has also established a data services section which monitors the quality of data on NIMS on an ongoing basis.</p><p>As part of NIMS, a new taxonomy consistent with the World Health Organisation taxonomy was introduced to facilitate more consistent reporting. The benefits of this will be seen as the system becomes the established reporting tool for both serious and less serious incidents.</p><p>As part of the roll out programme for NIMS, almost 700<font color="#FF0000"> </font>people have been trained to enter incidents on the system. Further training is currently underway to allow each service produce reports on its own data.</p></reply>

Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer. It is in this context that the HSE requires all safety incidents to be reported, managed and investigated. </p><p>The HSE's National Safety Incident Management Policy 2014 and the Guidelines for Systems Analysis Investigation of Incident and Complaints 2012 were developed by the Executive to protect patients and ensure that robust investigations are carried out.  The policy sets out the steps to be taken when an investigation is required and has been developed in line with international best practice in patient/service user safety and risk management. </p><p>The HSE recognises that some incidents, due to their seriousness, complexity, or where there are matters of significant public concern, will require investigations to have an additional level of independence.  In the acute hospital sector the HSE has formal arrangements in place with the Forum of Postgraduate Training Bodies in Ireland and Royal Colleges  in the UK for seeking nominations to Chair or participate in investigation teams.  The use of these external experts is the exception rather than the rule.</p><p>At the request of the Chief Clinical Director, Saolta University Healthcare Group, the Executive's National Incident Management and Learning Team established a <i>Review of the Maternity Services at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe</i>with an independent Review Team, chaired by Professor James Walker, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Leeds and supported by trained investigators.  The Review team are working towards the Review being completed by the end of this year.</p><p>Under Section 9 of the Health Act 2007 the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) may undertake an investigation as to the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the Health Service Executive if the Authority believes that on reasonable grounds there is a serious risk to the health or welfare of a person receiving those services.  I, as Minister, also have powers under the Health Act 2007 to request an investigation in particular circumstances.  In the case of the Portiuncula Review I will await the outcome of the HSE Review Team's work before deciding if any further course of action is appropriate. </p></reply>

This MOU has underpinned cooperation between the two bodies since then.</p>  <p>  HIQA recognises the Mental Health Commission's role in helping to drive improvements in the quality and safety of social care services that are provided for people being cared for in the mental health services. In fulfilling its statutory responsibilities, since September 2013 HIQA has used the MOU to ensure that its work is consistent with its statutory remit and with the terms of the MOU.</p>  <p>  HIQA has also used the MOU to inform its regulatory work when that work relates to care settings for which the Mental Health Commission also has a regulatory duty.  This results in a complementary approach which ultimately serves the best interests of people who use social care services.  HIQA has a strong and positive working relationship with the Commission in this regard. HIQA and the Mental Health Commission also interact through the work of Ireland's Health and Social Care Regulatory Forum.</p>  <p>  HIQA has no role in the inspection of mental health services, which is a matter for the Inspector of Mental Health Services.  Copies of the Inspector's reports are regularly published on the Mental Health Commission website and reports published since the signing of the memorandum can be found there.</p></reply>

However, it should be noted that healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists etc. employed in such independent private clinics or private healthcare facilities in Ireland are required to be registered with their relevant professional regulatory body and adhere to a professional code of conduct. Cosmetic surgery and non-surgical cosmetic treatments are regularly sought by Irish patients. All surgery contains a certain element of risk and patients should seek to inform themselves of both the risks and benefits of any procedures before making a decision to proceed.</p>  <p>  I am adopting a phased approach to the regulation of healthcare.  My Department continues to progress the Patient Safety Licensing Bill and is engaging with the Health Service Executive, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the independent healthcare sector to inform the finalisation of the General Scheme of the Bill prior to its consideration by Government.  In advance of a formal licensing regime for public and private hospitals it is proposed to bring the private/independent healthcare sector within the remit of the Health Act 2007.  The Government has given approval in principle to allow my Department draft amendments to the Health Act 2007 as an interim step towards licensing by extending HIQA&rsquo;s powers to set and monitor standards, and undertake investigations, where necessary, in the private healthcare sector.

As St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital is already established as the national liver transplant centre, and is a designated centre for pancreas cancer services, it is well placed to undertake pancreas transplants.  The arrangements being put in place will involve transplant surgeons from both St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital working together on the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus. The two hospitals, together with the HSE and my Department, are putting the necessary arrangements and protocols in place to facilitate the commencement of pancreas transplantation in St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in the coming weeks, should a suitable donor/recipient match occur.</p>  <p>  Interviews were held recently for consultant transplant surgeons and it is expected that two surgeons will commence work at St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in January 2016 to support the pancreatic transplant programme. St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital has also established a link with the pancreas transplant programme in Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary Hospital to provide oversight of the transfer of the pancreas transplant service.</p>  <p>  The deceased donor transplant programme is dependent on the availability of suitable donors who can be matched with recipients.  My Department and the HSE continue to work to improve organ donation and transplantation rates with the aim of reducing waiting times for patients.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's question relates to service delivery matters and accordingly I have asked the HSE to respond directly to him.</p>  <p>  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

This delivers on an a commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer's and other dementia's strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017. This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m.</p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of  making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>- the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home-care Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p>- the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GP's, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia.  The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points.etc;</p>  <p>- measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme. This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers and advocates. The Group also includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.

The number of applications received to 13 October this year is up 139% on the same period in 2014. I would like to advise the Deputy that, to 13 October, the number of people registered in 2015 was 1,495 and when this is compared to the same period in 2014, the number of people registered is 967 - this represents an increase of 55%.</p>  <p>  The latest figures from the NMBI indicate that they have 1,980 open applications, of which:</p>  <p>  -  1,348 have documentation outstanding (61%);</p>  <p>  -  81 have been approved and a fee is awaited by the NMBI; and</p>  <p>  -  168 further cases are waiting review.</p>  <p>  The Department has approved the filling of 16 posts and temporary measures have been put in place to ensure all applications received are dealt with in a timely manner.  NMBI informed the department on the 24 September that there are currently no backlogs in processing the post.  </p>  <p>  Seven adaptation programmes have been held for the nursing home sector since 2014 in order to allow overseas nurses to register in Ireland. One adaption programme has commenced and a further programme is scheduled later in the year. I understand that five adaption programmes will be held in 2016. At 23 September 2015, some 405 places have been made available so far on these courses.</p>  <p>  The NMBI has approved on a pilot basis, a new aptitude test with RCSI as an alternative method to assess candidates for registration. Nurses are currently being advised of the availability of this test and all who have a letter for adaptation are being contacted to advise them of this development. This test will be provided in November 2015 when a minimum cohort of 25 nurses is secured. Successful candidates will be recommended for registration to NMBI by RCSI.</p>  <p>  On 8 October 2015, a new overseas call centre service was launched by NMBI in response to the significant increase in applications for registration from overseas nurses and midwives. NHI and other key stakeholders were informed of the new overseas call centre service on 7 October. The website has been updated to inform the wider audience.</p></reply>

There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  The vaccine has not been available since the end of April 2015 and babies born after the last day of April have not been immunised.  Based on an estimated 5,500 - 6,000 babies born every month this means that 33,000 - 36,000 babies are due to be vaccinated.  The licensed supplier has informed the HSE that the BCG vaccine will be delivered into Ireland in late October.  The HSE will arrange appointments for vaccination clinics when the BCG vaccine supply is received.</p>  <p>  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG and with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) who licenses vaccines in Ireland as well as with other relevant stakeholders.  The HPRA have been seeking to find an alternative supply of BCG that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland.  To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer of BCG vaccine has been found.</p>  <p>  In early 2015 the HSE asked the HPRA to look at extending the shelf life of BCG vaccine from 12 months to 18 months.  The HPRA reviewed the necessary documentation and agreed to extend the shelf life of any new delivery of BCG vaccine to 18 months.  Any new deliveries of BCG will have an 18 month shelf life.</p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the National TB Advisory Committee have recommended stopping routine BCG vaccination of newborn babies and instead provide a selective vaccination of babies in high-risk babies groups.  The Department of Health have requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to conduct a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to review the implications of this change.  HIQA commenced a public consultation on proposed changes to the BCG vaccination programme in Ireland on September 9th 2015.  The HTA will be available by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Tuberculosis (TB) is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 452 of 2011).  In 2014, 328 cases of TB were notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, giving a national TB notification rate of 7.1 per 100,000, the lowest rate reported since surveillance commenced.  According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of a low incidence TB country is one with a national TB notification rate of less than 10 cases per 100,000, Ireland is in this category.</p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of TB has been falling and there were no cases of TB in young children in 2014.  Most European countries, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland do not give BCG vaccine to all babies.

The recent Healthy Ireland Survey shows that adult obesity seems to be levelling out however, 60% are still overweight. The most recent health information data on childhood obesity from 2012 studies <i>Growing Up in Ireland and the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative,</i>confirm that one in four children are overweight or obese.</p><p>This Government established a Special Action Group on Obesity (SAGO). The aim was to advise the Minister, based on best available evidence, on how best to halt the increase in rates of obesity and how to reduce the burden on individuals, communities and the State.  Its work programme has included:</p><blockquote>- The development of a new Obesity Policy and Action Plan for 2015 &ndash; 2025: <br /><br />- Publication of Healthy Eating Guidelines and a revised Food Pyramid;<br /><br />- Production of a report on Top Shelf Foods to promote healthy eating;<br /><br />- Commissioned a Health Impact Assessment in relation to fiscal measures on sugar sweetened drinks;<br /><br />- With Safefood, a multimedia campaign to tackle childhood obesity; and<br /><br />- Action during the Irish presidency of the EU which led to the development of an EU Joint Action on childhood obesity.</blockquote><p>My Department is currently developing Heads of a Health and Wellbeing Bill which will include calorie posting on menus.</p><p>In addition to the above, my Department assisted in food labelling, in the development of a number of treatment algorithms and clinical guidelines, providing for child monitoring in primary care, worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on advertising of food to children in the broadcast media and is also working on a Code of Practice for the food industry in relation to advertising, product placement and sponsorship.</p><p>Furthermore, Healthy Ireland was established to address the health of the nation. The Taoiseach and all Ministers agreed to work across Government Departments to achieve better health for the Irish population. The Government has established a Cross Sectoral Group to oversee this process and a Healthy Ireland Council has been appointed to advice and guide the process. Both groups have been proactive in relation to obesity.  One of the agreed programmes is the development of a National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland. My Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in partnership with a number of other key stakeholders have developed this draft Plan to encourage greater levels of physical activity by everyone living in Ireland and encouraging more children to be active will be a key focus of attention. I will shortly be seeking the approval of Government to publish the Plan later this year. </p><p>Also, my Department is finalising a national Obesity Policy and Action Plan. It will require the support of many sectors. The Obesity Policy will be ambitious in its scope and will have a key focus on children, including prevention, early intervention and treatment. It will set clear targets and a set of responsibilities for achieving these targets. The Policy will take a life course view with emphasise on maternity and childhood phases. The Action Plan will be concise and focus on outcomes.</p></reply>

As St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital is already established as the national liver transplant centre, and is a designated centre for pancreas cancer services, it is well placed to undertake pancreas transplants.  The arrangements being put in place will involve transplant surgeons from both St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital working together on the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus. The two hospitals, together with the HSE and my Department, are putting the necessary arrangements and protocols in place to facilitate the commencement of pancreas transplantation in St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in the coming weeks, should a suitable donor/recipient match occur.</p>  <p>  Interviews were held recently for consultant transplant surgeons and it is expected that two surgeons will commence work at St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in January 2016 to support the pancreatic transplant programme. St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital has also established a link with the pancreas transplant programme in Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary Hospital to provide oversight of the transfer of the pancreas transplant service.</p>  <p>  The deceased donor transplant programme is dependent on the availability of suitable donors who can be matched with recipients.  My Department and the HSE continue to work to improve organ donation and transplantation rates with the aim of reducing waiting times for patients. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The SDGs are universally applicable and will guide the actions of all countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger and achieve sustainable development over the next fifteen years.</p>  <p>  The Summit was a proud moment for Ireland, which played a central role in helping to deliver this historic agreement. The successful role of our diplomatic team in New York, as co-facilitators to the final round of negotiations, was widely acknowledged.  Ireland had already played a key role in framing the parameters of the new agenda at both EU and UN levels.  The SDGs are universally applicable, and all countries will need to take action.  In common with our EU partners, we will now focus on developing the most appropriate institutional framework to deliver the new development agenda domestically and internationally.</p>  <p>  &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, our policy for international development, clearly articulates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) on Official Development Assistance (ODA).  In his address to the UN Summit, the Taoiseach reiterated our commitment to making progress towards the 0.7% target.  </p>  <p>  Our track record in support of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme speaks for itself.  Over the past four years, we have protected and stabilised budget allocations, at a time of extraordinary economic difficulty. We stated consistently that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target once economic conditions allow.  As our economic recovery gains momentum and becomes more widely established, we can now begin delivering on that commitment.  </p>  <p>  The Budget for 2016, announced on 14 October, involves the first substantial increase in the aid budget in seven years.  For next year, we have provided a total of over &euro;640 million in ODA, an increase of &euro;40 million, or almost 7% on the 2015 level.  We estimate that this will entail a small increase in our ODA/GNP percentage, from a projected 0.35% in 2015 to a projected 0.36% in 2016.</p>  <p>  The major challenge for the year ahead will be to ensure Ireland continues to play a leading role in the comprehensive response to the unprecedented levels of humanitarian crisis, especially in Europe&rsquo;s broader neighbourhood, while ensuring our aid programme remains effective in addressing the root causes of poverty and hunger.</p></reply>

In particular, the role of thousands of Irish missionaries in Africa, over a long period of time and in extraordinarily challenging circumstances, deserves special mention.</p>  <p>  Irish people continue to play a critical role in the fight to eliminate poverty, hunger and injustice in developing countries.  Their work continues to make a significant difference to long term development efforts and to emergency humanitarian action globally.  </p>  <p>  An important element of overseas development and aid work is volunteering.  In 2013, the Government, as part of its commitment to volunteering, launched the Irish Aid Volunteering Initiative, which recognised the huge contribution that Irish volunteers have long made.  This Initiative aims to strengthen support for overseas volunteering &ndash; from the earliest stage when a person first considers volunteering to the volunteer&rsquo;s return home.</p>  <p>  Comhl&aacute;mh, the Irish Association of Development Workers and Volunteers, with support from Irish Aid, the Government&rsquo;s overseas development programme, undertook a survey into International Volunteering in 2013 from Ireland.  Based on this survey of Volunteer Sending Agencies, it is estimated that there were more than 1,700 Irish volunteers involved in development work in 2013.  </p>  <p>  The survey showed that volunteers from Ireland worked in 47 countries, including those countries with which Ireland has developed a longstanding relationship through Irish Aid. These include Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Vietnam. The data indicated that the majority of these were under the age of 30, with a high proportion of women volunteers. </p>  <p>  Given the significant numbers of Irish volunteers and missionaries working in overseas development, the number of countries in which they are working and the range of organisations, it is it not practicable to determine the precise number of Irish citizens involved at any given time.  However, it is clear that our volunteers, aid workers and missionaries and the officials working with the Irish Aid programme are delivering change in the lives of some of the poorest communities, especially in Africa, and contributing to one of the central priorities of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.</p></reply>

It is no secret that a number of Ministers and parties in the new Israeli Government are openly opposed to the two state solution, or to any serious compromise with Palestinians.  Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that this is not the policy of the government.  However, it would be fair to say that the Israeli Government has a lot to do to allay international doubts about their commitment to the peace process.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s policy on the Middle East has always been based on the belief that the two sides would need a degree of international assistance and pressure to reach a peace agreement. This is not dissimilar from our own peace process. I have also stated many times that I believe the international community needs to do more in this regard.</p>  <p>  In this context, the EU clearly has a role to play.  In recent months, I have raised at meetings of EU Foreign Ministers the need for the Union to find ways to protect the two state solution.  I hope that the appointment of an EU Special Representative will give greater impetus to our efforts in this regard and I look forward to further discussions with my colleagues at the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council.</p></reply>

This gives an indication of the overall costs involved in relation to restoring teacher numbers in small schools.</p>  <p>  In the current school year I introduced two new policies to provide some improvement to the staffing levels of some of our smallest schools. These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one-teacher schools.</p>  <p>  An appeals process is available to small schools in the event that they can show that their projected enrolments are sufficient to allow them to retain their classroom teacher in the longer term. Details of the appeal criteria are also set out in the published staffing arrangements. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in Budget 2016 for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year. These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p>  <p>  At primary level there will be a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule to be implemented for the 2016/17 school year. The improved staffing schedule is available on the Department website.</p>  <p>  The staffing arrangements for all schools for the 2016/17 school year will be published early in 2016.</p></reply>

All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs. </p><p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March, 2015.</p><p>Details of resource teaching allocations which have been made to schools is available on the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie.  The NCSE is also currently completing its second round allocation process to respond to late enrolments, or from diagnosed disabilities emerging after the closing date for the first allocation round, to the start of the new school year.</p><p>In circumstances where a school may have an application for resource teaching support pending on behalf on an individual child, learning support or resource teaching support can still be provided for that child from a school's general allocation of resource teaching/learning support provision, taking into account the needs of the child.</p><p>It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.</p><p>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The Strategy provides for the development of stronger links and partnerships between employers, employees and ETBs to provide education and training solutions that respond to the needs of learners and employers alike.</p>  <p>  The annual service planning process requires ETBs to set out how provision meets local and national employer needs and the needs of unemployed persons including those referred to education and training by the Department of Social Protection.  My Department is currently involved in the establishment of 9 Regional Skills Fora to enable ETBs and higher education institutions address employer skills needs in a more unified way and strengthen the links between learners and industry.</p>  <p>  FET programmes such as Traineeship and Momentum contain a work placement component where individuals can use and develop the skills they have learned in a class setting in a practical working environment.  In addition, the apprenticeship programme provides structured training in specified occupations both on and off the job.  There are also less formal workplace components on a range of other FET programmes.</p></reply>

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.</p>  <p>  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Under the Equal Status Act, 2000 schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act. However, the Act makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  Schools that comply with the requirements of the equality legislation do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in April of this year and is on the Government's legislative programme for enactment in this session, introduces a number of important changes to make enrolment policies fairer and more transparent.</p>  <p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.</p>  <p>  The Bill also requires schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

In this context, a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector was established to look at how schools could cater for diversity and ensure an inclusive environment for all their pupils. Work is continuing on implementing the Action Plan arising from this Forum, including advancing the patronage divesting process.</p>  <p>  Under this process, which creates greater choice for parents in areas where there is not a demographic need for new school provision, eight new multi-denominational primary schools have opened and work is continuing to advance choices in the other identified areas. I intend to reinvigorate the process to speed up divestment and to that end, I will be arranging to meet with the Catholic Bishops and with the other patrons in the coming period.</p>  <p>  In addition to divesting, in those areas where there is a demographic need for new schools, the arrangements introduced in 2011 place a strong emphasis on parental choice. Under this process, 20 new primary schools and 17 new post-primary schools have opened. 35 of these 37 schools have a multi-denominational ethos.</p>  <p>  With regard to admission to schools, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.</p>  <p>  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Under the Equal Status Act, 2000 schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act. However, the Act makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in April of this year and is on the Government's legislative programme for enactment in this session, introduces a number of important changes to make enrolment policies fairer and more transparent.</p>  <p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.</p>  <p>  The Bill also requires schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the patronage determination process for new schools requires prospective patrons to commit to enrolling pupils from the area to be served by the new school.</p></reply>

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale. </p><p>  Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012.  Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p><p>  These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.</p><p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement.  Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p><p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement has, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begun the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement.  However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p></reply>

In 2013, following the receipt of advice from the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on the future landscape of higher education, my predecessor set out the policy framework for the establishment of clusters of higher education institutions (HEIs).  These clusters have commenced work in the designated priority areas of academic planning and student pathways, and some have made considerable progress.  These cluster objectives have also been included in the mission based compacts agreed between the HEA and each HEI.  Regional Skills fora are also being developed to underpin the interaction between HEIs, further education and training providers and enterprise on skills needs at regional level.  Collaboration among regional stakeholders is a strong feature of the Action Plans for Jobs Regional initiative.</p><p>  In respect of all island provision, there are significant bilateral linkages between individual HEIs in the border regions, particularly Dundalk IT, IT Sligo and Letterkenny IT, and the University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast.  I am aware of the Indecon report of 2009 referred to by the Deputy; however I understand that despite some work by both institutions to develop co-ordinated planning and provision it has not been possible to advance this significantly in the interim.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p><p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p><p>  I would advise therefore that if the parents of the child in question, have specific concerns about his educational progress, that they speak in the first instance to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the NEPS psychologist assigned.</p></reply>

It is also permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.  No charge may be made, however, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p><p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in April of this year, prohibits the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions as part of the school admission process or for continued enrolment in the school.

It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students. </p><p>  Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.</p><p>  The revised primary curriculum recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.  Syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability.  </p><p>  Content is outlined in the curricula at both levels and process is also heavily emphasised. Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated.  The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels. </p><p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in collaboration with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment (CCEA), produced guidelines entitled &quot;Exceptionally Able Students &ndash; Draft Guidelines for Teachers&quot; which issued to all Primary and Post Primary schools in November 2007 along with a questionnaire for feedback. </p><p>  The NCCA/CCEA guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning.  The guidelines provide advice to schools on identification of gifted children, set out profiles of students, and whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students.  The general strategies include differentiated teaching, acceleration and enrichment approaches in the context of participation in mainstream schools. </p><p>  Finally, I wish to explain that the Special Education Support Service (SESS) is a service under the management of my Department which provides support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including those pupils who are exceptionally able.  The service is available to schools who may be seeking advice or support relating to a specific special education issue in the school.  More information on the range of programmes offered by the SESS is available on www.sess.ie. </p><p>  In addition, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), also under the management of my Department, provides training in differentiation, in terms of differentiating for all pupils, whether less able/more able.  Issues around exceptional ability and giftedness are addressed as part of the school planning process which is facilitated by the PDST.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements for the current school year are set out in Circular 0005/2015 which is available on the Department website.  The circular sets out the improvements that I introduced to the staffing schedule for the 2015/16 school year for small schools.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p>  <p>  The position is Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Education and Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.</p>  <p>  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in early April of this year, introduces a number of important changes to make enrolment policies fairer and more transparent.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p>  <p>  The allocation of a whole time equivalent of an additional 300 teachers to second level schools brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the school year 2016/17. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota.  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the PTR allocation will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school. </p>  <p>  The Department's Guidelines in relation to how Guidance should operate within schools will be updated for the next school year to reflect the change in the allocation process.  The Guidelines will underpin the responsibility of every school to make sure that they use this additional staffing to meet their obligations to provide guidance counselling support to all students. When the allocation for guidance was brought within quota DEIS schools were protected from the change by  providing for a 18.25:1 allocation compared to the general 19:1 allocation. The position of DEIS schools will be further enhanced by a change to an allocation on the basis of 17.95:1.</p></reply>

I have introduced two immediate actions to begin this work. </p><p>Firstly, the awarding of a grant of &euro;30,000, which will be provided by the HEA to the Union of Students' (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation.  This funding will allow USI to develop their homes.usi.ie website, to communicate more effectively to student and homeowners, and to carry out research into this important issue.</p><p>Secondly, the establishment of an inter-departmental steering group to oversee this work, the first meeting of which took place on 1 October 2015. This group will provide a coordinating mechanism to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to information on new potential funding and delivery models. A significant number of Action points have been identified for follow up arising from the first meeting.</p><p>Finally, the Government is committed to addressing the housing shortage through the Construction 2020 strategy. This will not resolve all of our problems immediately, but I am confident that the implementation of Construction 2020 will provide us with a sustainable housing stock in the medium to longer term.</p><p>The full report can be accessed at </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in Budget 2016 for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year. These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p><p>  My priority for additional investment has been to see smaller classes introduced at primary level and I am pleased that Budget 2016 will deliver this important measure. From next September the primary staffing schedule will operate on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils. This positive development will require approximately 300 additional teaching posts in primary schools.</p><p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

The overall programme allocation is some &euro;4.15m including an EU contribution of &euro;2.49m. </p><p>  An independently chaired consultative forum was established to offer advice and views on the implementation of the LTAI EGF programme and my Department produces implementation reports which are reviewed by the forum.  Two implementation reports have been produced to date on this programme which provide the detail sought by the Deputy in terms of overall participation, uptake of particular measures and labour market status of affected populations of both redundant workers and young persons not in employment, education or training. Copies of these reports are being issued to the Deputy and published on the dedicated website www.egf.ie </p><p>  These implementation reports do not contain financial data.  The level of final approved expenditure on EGF programmes is only known when all claims are duly made by the various service providers such as SOLAS, Education and Training Boards, Local Enterprise Offices, Higher Education Institutions and the Department of Social Protection who are generally carrying such expenditure under their own budgets.  Though interim claims may be made, it is usual for claims to be made to the Department for relevant EGF services in their entirety at the end of the programme. 60% of approved eligible EGF expenditure is provided by the EU and the balance is provided through national sources including voted Department expenditures and the National Training Fund.  As the LTAI EGF programme ends on 19 September 2016, expenditure will be eligible until that date with the exception of third level expenditure which may be eligible in certain instances until 19 March 2017. A final report will be presented to the European Commission by my Department on the implementation of the EU financial contribution of &euro;2.49m by 19 March 2017.  </p><p>  My Department submitted an EGF application for a programme of measures in support of 108 workers made redundant at the PWA International Ltd. (Pratt Whitney) facility in Rathcoole, Co. Dublin and for up to the same number of persons under 25 years not in employment, education or training on 19 June 2015. The application is currently undergoing inter-service consultation within the European Commission and, if approved by the College of Commissioners, must also be duly approved by the EU Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Similar services are currently being provided to the redundant PWAI workers as are being provided under the LTAI EGF programme though these are being funded entirely through national sources in anticipation of subsequent EU approval.  As this recent application has not yet been approved, no formal implementation report has been prepared to date.  Subject to the approval of this application, implementation reports will be published on www.egf.ie.  </p></reply>

The details of the particular case highlighted in the Question have been forwarded to the Department of Social Protection for further consideration.</p><p>In order to qualify for rent supplement, a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out and the person is deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the housing authority. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. There is no entitlement to rent supplement pending the completion of this assessment. </p><p>I understand that it is the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s policy that an assessment of eligibility for social housing support should generally be carried out by the relevant local housing authority in the area where a claim to rent supplement is made and the person intends to reside. This ensures that the relevant local authorities are made aware of and can take responsibility for the long-term housing needs of rent supplement tenants living within their administrative area. This reflects both the responsibility of local authorities in providing long-term housing supports and the temporary income support nature of rent supplement. </p><p>It is in this context that the Housing Assistant Payment (HAP) scheme, which is operational in the South Dublin County Council area, is being introduced on a pilot basis across local authorities. The implementation of the HAP scheme is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>. HAP provides for the transfer of responsibility for long term recipients of rent supplement who have a recognised housing need from the Department of Social Protection to the local authority sector, thus bringing all long-term social housing supports provided by the State together under the local authority system.</p><p>To be eligible for HAP, a person must first apply for and be approved for social housing support by the relevant local authority. Upon its introduction in a local authority area, HAP will replace rent supplement for those with a long-term housing need and who qualify for social housing support; rent supplement will no longer be an option for applicants in such cases. If a household is already on the local authority&rsquo;s housing list and currently in receipt of rent supplement, the household will be eligible for HAP. Such households, who are in receipt of rent supplement in local authorities areas where HAP is operational, are incrementally transferring from rent supplement to HAP support. </p></reply>

The HSE are responsible for the provision of healthcare supports to the homeless while the Department of Social Protection oversees issues relating to social exclusion.</p><p>A range of measures are being taken to address homelessness by securing a supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness. These measures have been identified in the Government's I<i>mplementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>(May 2014) and in the <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>(December 2014). Progress in implementing these plans is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform. The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>These Plans represent a whole-of-Government approach to dealing with homelessness and the implementation of measures identified in these plans is being overseen by a group of senior officials drawn from key State agencies concerned including my Department, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Health Service Executive, Tusla the Child and Family Agency, the Irish Prison Service and housing authorities. </p><p>Funding from my Department for emergency accommodation and homeless services is provided to housing authorities on a regional basis under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. In Budget 2016 I have secured funding of &euro;70 million for these purposes - an increase of 32% on the 2015 allocation of &euro;53 million and a 55% increase on the 2014 allocation of &euro;45 million.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection plays a key role with regard to income maintenance for homeless people; under the social welfare system homeless people have entitlement to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance, subject to the normal qualifying conditions. The Department of Social Protection, including through its Homeless Persons Unit and Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit in Dublin, works closely with local authorities, Government agencies and the non-governmental sector in assisting homeless persons to access private rented accommodation. Furthermore Rent Supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals with the scheme currently supporting approximately 63,800 people at a cost of over &euro;298 million in 2015, with over 15,300 tenancies awarded this year. In view of the difficulties experienced by persons as a result of the limited supply in the private rented market, the Department of Social Protection has implemented a range of preventative measures assisting some 4,200 rent supplement households throughout the country to retain their accommodation. The Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans to extend this arrangement to Galway City; of the 4,200 cases supported some 1,350 were supported following intervention under the Protocol. Also, under the Exceptional Needs Payments scheme assistance may be provided towards rent deposits or rent in advance;over 1,960 payments have issued to date in 2015 at a cost of almost &euro;1.1 million.</p></reply>

The European Council endorsed a binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. The target will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with the reductions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)   and non-ETS sectors amounting to 43% and 30% by 2030 compared to 2005, respectively. </p>  <p>  All Member States within the Union will participate in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity. Whilst Member State targets for 2030 are yet to be agreed, it is known that targets will be in the range of a 0% to 40% reduction relative to 2005, and that targets for Member States whose GDP per capita are above average should be adjusted to reflect cost effectiveness in a fair and balanced manner. A Commission proposal on this matter is expected towards the end of the second quarter of 2016. </p></reply>

However, recovering economic conditions have resulted in a proposal by South Dublin County Council to request the designation of an additional 100 hectares of land as part of the SDZ so that a new planning scheme can be drawn up for the area that responds to changed economic circumstances, takes advantage of infrastructural investment in the area and potential for further investment and achieves sustainable place-making and high quality urban design.  </p>  <p>  The legislative process for Strategic Development Zone designation requires that I consult with the relevant development agency or planning authority on the proposed designation.

However, there are currently two Planning reviews being carried out by my Department. </p>  <p>  The first has been undertaken by MacCabe Durney Barnes Consultants, who were appointed in February 2014 to carry out an independent planning review on the performance of planning functions having regard to specific planning issues in respect of six planning authorities (Carlow, Cork, Galway and Meath County Councils and Cork and Dublin City Councils) in accordance with section 255 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  I have received the final report from the consultants and am currently considering its contents. It is my intention to publish this shortly. </p>  <p>  The second review follows on from the Order made by the High Court on 14 June 2013, quashing that part of my Department's Planning Review Report (2012) relating to Donegal, following a settlement between my Department and the party concerned who had brought judicial review proceedings in respect of that part of the Report. The matter has been disposed of to the satisfaction of both sides. In light of these proceedings, my Department subsequently sought the advice of the Attorney General on how best to proceed in the case of issues raised in relation to planning matters in Donegal.   </p>  <p>  Taking account of advice from the Office of the Attorney General my Department has appointed, on a non-statutory basis, Senior Counsel to prepare a review report in relation to these matters. This report will be prepared in line with terms of reference which have been agreed in consultation with the Attorney General's Office.</p></reply>

Where the level of refurbishment required is greater, a local authority can seek support from my Department and I have directed that in such instances, funding is to be provided to support the authorities in returning all such eligible housing units to productive use as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The role of my Department is to provide the legislative framework to address the issue. Under the Litter Pollution Act 1997, the primary responsibility for management and enforcement responses to litter pollution, including the defacement of structures by writing or other marks, lie with local authorities. The Act provides significant powers to local authorities to deal with litter and the defacement of structures by writing or other marks. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions to deal with graffiti, taking account of local circumstances and competing priorities. My Department does not compile statistics on local authority expenditure on graffiti removal.</p>  <p>  In order to support local authority efforts to tackle littering and graffiti, my Department provides grant funding under the Anti-Litter and Anti-Graffiti Scheme whereby local authorities are invited to submit proposed eligible projects for their functional areas. It is open to local community groups to approach their local authority for assistance with funding for anti-littering and anti-graffiti projects aimed at encouraging long-term behavioural change by individuals who engage in this unsocial behaviour. Under the scheme, each local authority decides which local projects to fund based on its own circumstances and priorities. In 2015, I made a total of &euro;690,000 available to fund suitable projects under this scheme. </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality also has a role in the control of graffiti through the Criminal Damage Act 1991, which provides for the offences of damaging or defacing property.</p></reply>

Rents for houses were 6.4% higher, while apartment rents were 7.6% higher than in the same quarter of 2014.</p>  <p>  These annual rates of increase were driven mainly by the Dublin market. Overall, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 9.2% in Dublin (with house rents up by 8.8% and apartment rents higher by 9.4%). Annual growth in rents for the market outside Dublin was more subdued. In the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 5.8% (with house rents up by 5.8% and apartment rents higher by 5.9%).   </p>  <p>  A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts. Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed. Construction 2020 also commits to identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development.   </p>  <p>  Addressing the supply shortfall in housing will take time but in the period since the publication of Construction 2020, some welcome signs of recovery in the sector have become evident. Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure. The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014.   </p>  <p>  Social housing is a key priority for the Government, as evidenced by the &euro;2.9 billion committed to under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan. In Budget 2016 investment in housing infrastructure has again been given priority with exchequer investment of almost &euro;811 million across a range of housing programmes. In addition, local authorities will also fund a range of housing services from their own resources to the value of over &euro;112 million, bringing the total Housing provision in 2016 to &euro;923 million. This will significantly address the needs of households on the housing waiting lists and provide flexibility to meet potential future demand with over 17,000 households to be accommodated in 2016.   </p>  <p>  On Budget day Minister Kelly and I also announced the approval of site locations for over 500 new social housing units which are to be delivered through a public private partnership (PPP) programme. This social housing is to be developed at six sites in co-operation with the local authorities in each area, with a capital value of approximately &euro;100 million. There is provision for a total investment of &euro;300 million in social housing through the public private partnership model and, overall, the programme is expected to deliver 1,500 social housing units. </p>  <p>  NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020 with 90 per cent of these units to be in the greater Dublin area. Achieving this new target by the end of 2020 means delivering on average 80 new housing units every week, across some 100 active sites. An Affordable Rental Pilot Scheme, which was announced as part of Budget 2016, is currently being developed in my Department.  The sum of &euro;10 million has been made available from the proceeds of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann for the scheme, which I expect to be rolled out in 2016.   </p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, I am continuing to work on proposals to address the issue of rising rents. The regulation of rent raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike. Ultimately, any decision in relation to this issue is a matter for Government and it is my intention to bring final proposals to Government for decision as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The targets set and the funding allocated are being invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes by local authorities, designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists.</p><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme continues to provide a targeted approach to meeting long-term rental housing assistance needs through the development of medium or long-term contractual arrangements with private accommodation providers. In line with the targets set for social housing delivery, the number of additional units targeted under the Rental Accommodation Scheme nationally to 2017 is 4,000, with 2,000 of these to be provided in 2015.</p><p>Also in line with the targets, I announced a major social housing construction programme on 5 May 2015, with &euro;312m investment covering all 31 local authorities and with over 1,700 housing units to be built.  In July I announced a further investment of over &euro;180 million to deliver over 1,100 new social housing units. This included over &euro;150 million in approvals under the Capital Assistance Scheme which supports Approved Housing Bodies in the provision of new housing units for homeless persons, for the elderly and for people with disabilities. Details of the projects approved in May and July are available on my Department's website at the following links:.</p><p>Through the annual estimates process, Exchequer capital funding of over &euro; 189million is available to local authorities under these initiatives this year, with a further &euro; 48.6 million being self-funded by local authorities from Local Property Tax.  To date in 2015, local authorities have drawn down almost &euro;39 million, while a further &euro;13.8 million has be en self-funded by local authorities from their Local Property Tax resources.  In relation to the Rental Accommodation Scheme, some &euro;135m in Exchequer funding is available this year, with a further &euro;40m being self-funded by local authorities from built-up RAS reserves. To date in 2015, local authorities have drawn down some &euro;69.3m in Exchequer funding while a further &euro;5.5m has been self-funded by local authorities from those RAS reserves to date.  I expect a significant amount of further funding to be drawn down by local authorities under these initiatives in the final quarter of 2015, which is traditionally the time of greatest funding drawdown by local authorities.</p><p>Delivery by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies is being closely monitored by my Department. Minister of State Coffey and I met with local authority Chief Executives and Directors of Housing recently to review progress in this regard. The local authorities indicate that the overall target of 7,000 additional social housing units in 2015 will be achieved. This will include maximising the number of vacant social housing units to be brought back into productive use this year. Last year local authorities returned 2,300 vacant units under my Department&rsquo;s capital programme and I anticipate a further 2,500 such units to be made available this year to those on waiting lists. </p><p>Given the time-lag between approval and delivery in terms of construction projects, a successful programme to remediate vacant units, as well as the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, are important parts of social housing delivery this year. These areas are being advanced strongly by local authorities, alongside the advancement of the construction projects that I have sanctioned this year. I am confident that by utilising all delivery mechanisms under current and capital expenditure programmes, local authorities will continue to deliver social housing targets in 2015, in line with the Social Housing Strategy.</p></reply>

The 2007 Tyre Regulations were focused on matching what was placed on the market with what came off the market as waste. If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility  Initiative (PRI)   model. </p>  <p>  As part of a wider Ministerial review of producer responsibility matters, a specific module was devoted to structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres. The results of this examination   were stark. The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:</p>  <p>-    A non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,</p>  <p>  -  A lack of consistent and accurate data,</p>  <p>-  That the current system was not tracking data flows well, and</p>  <p>-  Between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for.   </p>  <p>  Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry, I announced my decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015. The new scheme will be operated by Repak with a registration and reporting role for the WEEE Register Society. Since my decision, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.   </p>  <p>  Distance sellers, i.e. those placing tyres on the Irish market but located outside the State, will   have exactly the same obligations as any operator based in Ireland so the suggestion that operators based outside the jurisdiction will have a competitive advantage over their Irish counterparts is unfounded. The distance seller approach has been very successfully used under existing arrangements for distance sellers of electrical and electronic equipment.   </p>  <p>  The 300% + increase in the cost of tyre disposal referred to in the Question, is a suggestion being circulated by elements within the tyre industry, but is also unfounded. The model that I am proposing will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply. The fact is that the fundamental pillars of any successful PRI structure elsewhere in the EU are a robust financial model, supported by an adequate visible Environmental Management Charge (vEMC). This approach ensures that waste tyres are fully accounted for and properly treated without public funds being called on to remove the blight of illegal stockpiles across the country.  Members of the public currently pay an environmental charge when purchasing new tyres but often their contribution is not being used for the intended purpose and waste tyres leak from the system, often ending up stockpiled illegally and causing a   blight on our environment. </p>  <p>  Just at the point where discussions on the financial model and the level of the vEMC were about to commence, the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) withdrew from the Tyres Working Group. Despite their withdrawal, and the earlier withdrawal of ITWRA, my Department will continue to work on the introduction of a full PRI scheme. Both the ITIA and the ITWRA continue to receive all Tyres Working Group related correspondence and I have urged them on several occasions to re-join the process and re-engage. It is a matter for both organisations to accept this invitation and I would again appeal to both organisations to embrace the opportunity to influence the shape of the new structures, particularly in relation to those key issues around funding and structure.</p></reply>

The capped annual charges are &euro;160 for single adult households and &euro;260 for all other households until the end of 2018. Through conservation of water those on metered supply can reduce their costs and pay less than the capped costs. The benefit of capped charges is that all households will know what their maximum water bills will be until the end of 2018.   </p>  <p>  Under the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013, Irish Water is obliged to charge customers connected to the public water or waste water systems for services provided. Households who do not register with Irish Water will receive a default bill for &euro;260 per annum per dwelling. In addition, such households will not be entitled to the &euro;100 water conservation grant for their primary dwelling.   Various easy-pay options are available through post offices or other payment providers. The overall net cost for those who register is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others. </p>  <p>  This charging structure makes water charges affordable, simpler and fairer, providing more clarity and certainty to households. The intention is that average charges will continue to be kept low through ongoing subvention to Irish Water and the Government has legislated in the Water Services Act 2014 so that domestic charges from 2019 onwards can continue to be subject to caps set by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

My Department has recently published a helpful guidance note which can be accessed by clicking on the following weblink:.</p><p>Any consumer engaging a builder to undertake building works on their behalf should as a minimum satisfy themselves that the builder is competent to undertake the works concerned (on the basis of having satisfactorily undertaken similar works for others); is tax compliant; is compliant with relevant requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act; and is prepared to sign a contract which may be enforced by civil means should that be necessary. Where problems arise, redress is a matter between the parties concerned i.e. the homeowner, the builder and their insurers, if any, subject to the terms of any contract in place.</p><p>The Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) has been established as a voluntary register of builders, contractors and specialist trade persons by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF). I understand that over 750 construction entities are currently included on the register which is available online at . Under the <i>Construction 2020</i>strategy, the Government has signalled its commitment to placing the register on a statutory footing. This is seen as an essential consumer protection measure giving consumers who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator. Legislative proposals in this regard are currently being prepared by my Department with a view to their being presented to Government for consideration in the near future.</p></reply>

This consultation process afforded all stakeholders the opportunity to make written submissions on all aspects of eel fishing in Ireland. This process includes a review of the status of the eel stocks nationally and the potential for any commercial fishery in the future. IFI has recently presented my Department with a copy of this report along with their management advice.</p><p>The latest restocking advice from ICES (2014) states that &lsquo;Internationally coordinated research is required to determine the net benefit of restocking on the overall population, including carrying capacity estimates of glass eel source estuaries as well as detailed mortality estimates at each step of the stocking process.&rsquo; ICES recommend countries undertake a risk assessment before stocking to ensure that there is a net benefit in moving glass eel or elvers to new catchments as opposed to leaving them where they are (the potential benefits of eel stocking should for instance take cognisance of any mortality rates associated with capture, transport and stocking out of juvenile eel as well as the suitability of recipient waters in terms of water quality, and existence of eel fisheries or hydroelectric facilities).</p><p>Due to the long-lived life history of eels it should be noted that it would take approximately 10-12 years for male and 16-18 years for female stocked eel to contribute to Irish silver eel escapement levels and the overall 40% long-term escapement target required by the EU Eel Regulation.</p><p>All aspects of this report are being carefully considered in my Department as it will clarify and update the situation for eel fishing in Ireland. This report will inform any decision as regards the future management options for the eel fisheries.

In the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage for the county, the related building was rated of &lsquo;National&rsquo; significance.</p>  <p>  In recognition of that significance, conservation works have been undertaken in recent years to the building with public funding support in the region of &euro;2m being channelled through the Heritage Council. This was directed at the vital re-roofing works necessary to secure the survival of the fabric of the asset.  </p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances. Funding for the protection of built heritage continues to be provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which are either directly administered or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.  The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2015 is focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the growing risk to the sustainable future of the remaining stock of large Irish Historic Houses, where owners have consistently struggled throughout the last century to find sustainable alternative means of meeting the on-going costs of their maintenance. My Department is also aware of the recent economic report commissioned by Mayo County Council by CHL Consulting Ltd showing visitor numbers in relation to the institution referred to.</p>  <p>  I am prepared to work closely with the owners of such properties.  In February 2015, I approved the establishment of an Irish Historic Houses Committee, with representatives from relevant Government Departments, the Irish Historic Houses Association (a representative body for Historic House owners), F&aacute;ilte Ireland, relevant non-governmental organisations and a number of individual house owners. </p>  <p>  The Committee&rsquo;s main objective was to provide me with advice regarding strategies to support the sustainable future of Irish historic houses. There are, in particular, complexities of balancing private ownership with public benefit. I also see the need to examine if existing supports provided by government departments, local government, State agencies and non-governmental organisations could be better co-ordinated in order to better support the owners who are the custodians of these properties.</p>  <p>  My Department has now concluded a draft Action Plan in this regard that I hope to publish shortly.   </p></reply>

The Council may then make recommendations to me, as Minister, on such cases. </p><p>As part of the appeals process the Council has established an Appeals Sub Group consisting of 3 members of the Council. While the terms of reference in relation to the Peatlands Council&rsquo;s appeals function have been agreed between the Council and myself, as Minister, the operation of the appeals function is a matter for the Council itself.</p><p>I am advised that, following agreement on the terms of reference of the Council&rsquo;s appeals function, the appellant, referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, was informed by the Secretary of the Council, on 12 January last, that it was hoped to arrange a consideration of the appeal by the Appeals Sub Group as soon as possible. I am further advised that the Appeals Sub Group considered the appeal on 19 February 2015, 1 April 2015, 22 June 2015 and 19 August 2015. </p><p>The Appeals Sub Group reported to the Peatlands Council on this case on 28 April and 1 October 2015 and I understand that the Secretary of the Council recently wrote to the appellant seeking his consent to request relevant documentation from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p><p>Once the documentation is received from that Department, I understand that the Appeals Sub Group will consider the appeal further with a view to making a recommendation to the Peatlands Council as soon as possible. </p><p>I am informed that the Peatlands Council has received 11 appeals in relation to decisions made by my Department on applications under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme which come within the terms of reference of the Peatlands Council&rsquo;s appeals function, agreed in January 2015. There are 4 appeals cases currently being considered and in 7 cases the Peatlands Council has agreed on the recommendation of the Appeals Sub Group.</p><p>Following agreement on the terms of reference of the Peatlands Council&rsquo;s appeals function, the average time taken by the Council to agree on a recommendation of the Appeals Sub Group is 24 weeks, from receipt of the appeal. The longest period for the Council to agree on a recommendation of the Appeals Sub Group is 38 weeks, from receipt of the appeal.</p><p>Details of the 4 appeal cases regarding which the Peatlands Council has yet to agree on a recommendation of the Appeals Sub Group are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Case Number</th><th>Date Appeal Received by Peatlands Council</th><th>Number of times Appeals Sub Group has met to consider appeal case and date(s) of meeting(s)</th><th>Number of times Peatlands Council has met to consider appeal case and date(s) of meeting(s)</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>16 May 2014*</td><td>4 (19 February 2015, 1 April 2015, 22 June, 2015, 19 August 2015) </td><td>2 (28 April 2015, 1 October 2015)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>21 February 2015</td><td>3 (1 April 2015, 22 June 2015, 19 August 2015)</td><td>2 (28 April 2015, 1 October 2015)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>11 May 2015</td><td>2 (22 June 2015, 19 August 2015)</td><td>1 (1 October 2015)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>22 May 2015</td><td>2 (22 June 2015, 19 August 2015)</td><td>1 (1 October 2015)</td></tr></table>*The terms of reference of the Peatlands Council&rsquo;s appeals function were agreed In January 2015.</p><p>In addition, 2 appeals cases have been recently received and were acknowledged by the Secretary of the Council on 16 October last.  Another appeal case does not relate to the qualifying criteria of the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme but to the compensation available to the applicant under the scheme. </p></reply>
