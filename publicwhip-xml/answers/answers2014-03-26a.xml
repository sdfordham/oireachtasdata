    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-26a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032600079#WRA00500"><p>The broad outline for developing the sheep industry in Ireland was set out in the Food Harvest 2020 document which envisages a 20% increase in value terms of the sector by 2020.  My approach in achieving this objective is to drive the development of the industry at home and increase Ireland`s market share of the world market.  This will ensure that producers and processors can plan for the future, increasing the value of the industry for the benefit of all.</p><p>In terms of the performance of the sector in 2013, I am pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew,<i></i>reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 8%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by<i></i>  around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. The market outlook for Irish sheepmeat in 2014 looks reasonably stable as a result of ongoing tight EU sheep supplies and a reduced presence of New Zealand lamb.  Average prices to date this year are almost 6% ahead of 2013.</p><p>  At producer level I continue to put in place incentives to ensure that producers see a viable future in the sector. I recently announced the extension of the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) for a further year. In committing funding of &euro;3m to the programme in 2014 I am acknowledging the success of the 2013 scheme in which 4,000 producers participated. Support for the sheep sector also comes from the sheep grassland Scheme for which I have prioritised funding over the last four years. This scheme delivered &euro;68 million directly to the incomes of Irish sheep farmers and I am very pleased that the scheme will operate again in 2014, with an increased budget of &euro;15 million.</p><p>  In addition to the budget for the 2014 Scheme being increased from &euro;14 million to &euro;15 million, there is the additional benefit to participating farmers in that payments under the Scheme will not be liable to Modulation, which previously applied at varying rates up to a maximum of 10%. The Modulation deductions made in respect of payments under the 2013 Scheme represent 7.5%. While it is envisaged that the payment rates will be increased under the 2014 Scheme, allowance must be taken of increased sheep numbers but overall I expect that an additional &euro;2 million will be paid to sheep farmers in 2014 under the scheme.</p><p>  As you are aware I am proposing under the new CAP that payments received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme will be incorporated into the calculation of the entitlement value in each year of the new regime for those farmers who participated in that Scheme. This will have the effect of increasing their entitlement value and ensure that such farmers do not lose through the cessation of the scheme at the end of 2014. This will include the additional &euro;2 million payable in 2014 and will mean that enhanced funding will be available to sheep farmers under the new regime.</p><p>  Under the new Rural Development Progrmme (RDP) I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under the knowledge transfer measure and the lessons learned from STAP will inform the development of this measure. The RDP programme will provide support to farmers by means of a range of measures across a number of priorities, including environmental objectives. The new agri-environment scheme, GLAS (Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme) will support, among others, extensive and hill farmers, who have shown themselves to be careful custodians of the countryside in previous agri-environment schemes. GLAS intends giving priority to those commonage farmers who reach a collective agreement on the management of these valuable landscapes.  It also includes a menu of environmental actions, many of which will be suitable for all sheep farmers. </p><p>  On the export front I intend to drive further the search for new markets.  My Department in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities. The usefulness of alternative markets as a buffer against market volatility was obvious in the sheep export statistics for 2013.  Because of the economic downturn in the UK and France our exports to those markets dipped but we were able to offset this loss with increased exports to Belgium, Germany and Sweden thereby showing a positive net result for the sector at the end of the year. </p></reply>

These new schemes will offer farmers the opportunity to undertake enhanced environmental actions to protect important habitats and species on agricultural land.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has primary responsibility for the implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives and therefore the input of that Department is critical to the design of a successful suite of measures under the overall heading of GLAS (Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme).</p><p>  I announced details of the new GLAS and GLAS+ Scheme on 14 January 2014 as part of a suite of proposed measures under the new Rural Development Programme. The GLAS Scheme will provide significant funding to farmers who undertake environmental actions in line with national and EU environmental objectives. It will contribute to the overall public good and will build on the success of previous agri-environment schemes.</p><p>  The entire Rural Development Programme must be submitted to the European Commission for approval. In advance of this my Department must undertake a public consultation, an ex ante evaluation, a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats), a needs assessment, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and an appropriate assessment (AA), as part of the development of the Programme. An independent evaluator has been contracted to prepare the ex ante evaluation report, SEA and AA and to advise on the SWOT analysis. An initial round of consultation with stakeholders took place in 2013 and written submissions were received.  On the basis of these, and taking account of the requirements of the Council Regulation, an outline of the GLAS Scheme was developed and published in the Rural Development Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 Draft Consultation Programme on 14 January, 2014, seeking submissions by 19 February, 2014.  These submissions, in addition to ongoing consultation with stakeholders such as the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, will inform final decisions on measures to be included in the new GLAS and GLAS+ Scheme.</p></reply>

My Department is currently considering the comments received from the various stakeholders in response to the consultation paper which was published by my Department in January 2014.</p><p>  The consultation paper sets out a number of priorities in the case of on-farm investment schemes under the new Programme, including further support to encourage investment in the dairy sector due to the forthcoming abolition of milk quotas, an enhanced scheme of grant-aid for young farmers with a special grant-rate of 60 per cent, and a new farm building measure which will provide grant-aid for the construction of animal housing and slurry storage.    </p><p>  My Department considered the possibility of putting forward a targeted farm drainage scheme for EU Commission approval within the context of the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme, but concluded that too many issues of an environmental, financial and administrative nature would have to be overcome in proposing such a scheme as a priority measure under the new Programme. My Department&rsquo;s consultation paper states that further targeted areas may be identified within the lifetime of the new Programme as appropriate for grant-aid and the issue of a drainage scheme will be borne in mind in that context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-26a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032600080#WRB00700"><p>It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of some 95,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  </p><p>  While the budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme was reduced from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million, I can confirm that the budget was subsequently increased to &euro;195 million for the 2013 Scheme. Funding of the 2014 Scheme will be maintained at this level. </p><p>  With regard to the funding reduction for the 2012 Scheme, prompted by the financial crisis, rather than simply apply an across the board cuts to all participants, it was decided to achieve the necessary saving in expenditure under the 2012 Scheme by making changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria. This was designed to focus the aid payment on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme. However, being particularly mindful that any proposed changes in scheme qualifying criteria, regardless of how focused and targeted their aim, would result in anomalies, specific provision was made for those farmers, whose stocking rates in 2011 were less than required, by putting in place a formal procedure to cater for all who considered that their inability to meet the revised scheme requirements was due to force majeure/exceptional circumstances. Those affected were invited to outline such details to this Department, with each case then being considered on its merits.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, the changes to the 2012 Scheme criteria required the agreement of the EU Commission, which was sought and obtained.</p><p>  While the Terms and Conditions governing the 2014 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme have yet to issue to farmers, I can confirm that there are no changes for 2014. The Terms and Conditions booklets are currently with the printers and it is envisaged that these will be posted to all farmers during the first week in April. </p><p>  I should also point out, however, that maps have recently issued to all farmers, with the request that these be closely examined and any necessary changes notified to my Department as soon as possible. While recent media coverage has focused on the need for farmers to identify and remove ineligible areas, there are also cases where all eligible areas should be included - given the need to ensure the accuracy of my Department&rsquo;s land parcel database, it is critical that farmers take the time to carefully scrutinise these maps and notify my Department of whatever changes are identified.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-26a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032600080#WRB00900"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Food Harvest 2020 strategy for Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food industry is the result of a collaborative approach to policy making and includes as it does for all sectors of the industry, a vision for the beef sector developed and agreed by stakeholders, including farm bodies and processors. </p><p>  With regard to prices, it should be noted that Irish beef prices were 106% of the EU average in 2013. The average price change over the first 10 weeks of this year is an approximate 1.8% reduction but it must be remembered that it is common for prices to decrease slightly in the first quarter of any year. It should also be noted that with the exception of 2013 the prices paid in the first 10 weeks of 2014 for Irish cattle are comparable to 2012 and significantly in excess of prices paid from 2008-2011.Nevertheless it is clear that for some farmers with certain categories of animals prices have softened significantly in the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>  The period since the publication in 2010 of Food Harvest 2020 has generally been characterised by increases in beef export values and cattle prices. It would be unrealistic to think that the vision laid down in Food Harvest would never be challenged by market or other conditions. However, to view the significant progress made in the beef sector in recent years as a result of the commitment of Government, farmers and other stakeholders, through the prism of the current market difficulties alone, would, in my view, do a disservice to all of the stakeholders in this critically important sector. The principles laid down in Food Harvest constitute a vision for the sector which I am confident remains valid, despite the current price and specification difficulties. I am committed to ensuring that the measures announced this year, and the new Rural Development Programme, provide the tools to enable beef farmers to reduce costs and improve profitability and to make their enterprises more sustainable. </p><p>  In relation to the current difficulties between farmers and processors, the Deputy will appreciate that ultimately questions of price and market specification are matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle and it is neither appropriate nor possible for me to intervene directly on these issues. Nonetheless I recently met farmer representatives and processers to discuss the current situation. Following that interaction, I am hopeful that the factories, in collaboration with the farming bodies, will be able to resolve the various issues that have lately caused difficulties for some producers. At my request, Meat Industry Ireland (MII) member companies have kept their livestock offices open to deal with farmers with any particular queries or concerns on the marketing of their stock.  MII member companies have made available contact details for each of their main plants to enable farmers to phone them directly.</p><p>  As an indication of Government support for the sector, actions identified in Food Harvest and the subsequent Beef Activation Group Report as necessary for the development of the beef sector have been implemented. Indeed in 2014, I announced operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014. Among the measures in this investment package are &euro;23m for a Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the beef sector. </p></reply>

I understand from figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, that the overall capital cost costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed. </p><p>  I informed both groups at the time and many times since, that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  I also informed both groups that it was my job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.</p><p>  In this connection, at the last meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in June 2013, which I chaired under Ireland's EU Presidency, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry.  I am glad to note that this agreement has been welcomed by those parties who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.  </p></reply>

The issue of animal welfare is broad and the welfare of horses will undoubtedly be one of the topics discussed. </p><p>  With regard to animal welfare, my Department devotes considerable resources to this area and, in particular, to the welfare of horses.  My Department paid some &euro;3m to the Local Authorities under the Control of Horses Act in 2013 to enable them to deal with stray and unwanted horses.  This enabled the Local Authorities to remove almost 4,000 stray or unwanted horses last year and thereby resolve a number of serious horse welfare situations.  A further significant number of horses have been removed since the beginning of the year.</p><p>  In addition, in December 2013, I announced funding of &euro;1.8m to 136 organisations involved in animal care and welfare services throughout the country to support their activities in 2014.  The level of funding being provided to these organisations was increased for the third year in a row, reflecting the importance I attach to their work.

In December 2013, I announced funding of &euro;1.8m to 136 organisations involved in animal care and welfare services throughout the country to support their activities in 2014.  The level of funding provided to the organisations was increased for the third year in a row, reflecting the importance I attach to their work.  Increased funding was concentrated on organisations involved in horse welfare, including the DSPCA, to ensure sufficient resources are available to enable them cater for any difficulties arising in the area of horse welfare during 2014 and to assist them in complying with new legislation on equine identification and equine premises registration.  The DSPCA received an amount of &euro;210,000 (compared with &euro;150,000 the previous year) to assist the society in its activities in 2014.</p><p>  In addition to funding animal welfare bodies, my Department has very active engagement with local authorities and the Gardai on control of horses' issues.  In 2013, my Department paid some &euro;3.1m to the local authorities to assist them in their work under the Control of Horses Act, 1996 in dealing with stray, abandoned and unwanted horses.  Of this, almost &euro;568,000 was provided to the four local authorities in the Dublin area.  This enabled the removal of in excess of 4,700 stray or unwanted horses last year (of which almost 840 seizures related to the Dublin county and city area).  The removal of such a significant number of horses in the Dublin area has undoubtedly resolved a number of potentially serious horse welfare situations and has alleviated the burden on the animal welfare bodies, including the DSPCA, operating in the Dublin catchment area. </p><p>  A further significant number of abandoned and welfare compromised horses have been removed since the beginning of this year.  In addition to the ongoing work of local authorities in addressing horse welfare issues, my Department's veterinary officials continue to adopt a proactive approach in dealing with and addressing horse welfare issues, where appropriate in conjunction with the DSPCA and other animal welfare bodies and with local farming representatives and the local authorities.</p></reply>

Day-to-day operational matters, such as the management of their forest estate, are the responsibility of the company.</p><p>  In relation to this matter, the company has advised that on Friday 3rd of January 2014, Phytophthora ramorum had been confirmed on Japanese larch trees in Gougane Barra Forest Park, County Cork.  Samples were taken from different suspected larch areas in the park which were confirmed as positive from two separate laboratories on both a morphological and molecular basis.  To prevent the further spread of the disease, control measures were implemented in accordance with Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine protocols. </p><p>  Felling the infected trees is the appropriate measure with the aim of preventing further spread by limiting spore production.  If no action is taken, the larch within the park would succumb to the disease over a short number of years and act as a source for further infection.  Once the larch is cleared, Coillte will commence replanting with a range of different tree species including species such as Scots pine and oak. </p><p>  Harvesting, which started in January is progressing with approximately 70% of the felling complete.  There has been some storm damage in Gougane that will have to be cleared up but it is expected the park will remain closed for six months from when the operations began until its completion.  Coillte estimate that up to 16,000 trees, primarily Japanese larch will be felled and removed under licence from the site for processing at approved facilities. </p><p>  Phytophthora ramorum is a fungus like disease that can affect a range of tree and other plant species with Japanese larch particularly susceptible.  Coillte have been working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to detect and prevent the spread of this disease and has carried out all its operations in accordance with and subject to the protocols established by the Department.  Regrettably, Gougane Barra is one of 20 Coillte forests where the disease has been confirmed in Japanese larch since first detected on the species in 2010.  </p><p>  In late 2002 the EU introduced Emergency Measures to reduce the risk of further introductions and spread of Phytophthora ramorum into the EU.  Under the legislation surveys have been conducted annually by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Prior to 2010 the disease had been detected only on 'wild' Rhododendron bushes growing in woodlands in this country.  Also prior to 2010, it has been detected in this country on imported commercial Rhododendron and other ornamental nursery stock. </p><p>  Pure Japanese larch stands make up less than 2% of the Coillte forest estate and to date Coillte have carried out felling on 150 hectares of forest in an effort to contain and prevent the spread of this disease.  Infected sites can range from recently planted areas to mature forests. Timber from infected Japanese larch can still be used, so after felling and having put in place the appropriate biosecurity precautions, the logs can be taken under licence to authorised processing facilities under Departmental approval.</p></reply>

As most aquaculture activity takes place in 'Natura 2000' areas (i.e. areas protected under EU Birds/Habitats Directives), it is necessary to undertake an 'Appropriate Assessment' of the effects of aquaculture activity on these areas before any new licences can be issued or any existing licences can be renewed.  </p><p>  In the negotiations to address the ECJ judgement a process was agreed with the European Commission.  This process includes the following steps:</p><p>  - Data Collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries</p><p>  - Detailed analysis of the raw data collected</p><p>  - Setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site</p><p>  - Carrying out Appropriate Assessments (AA) &ndash; by the Marine Institute -  of aquaculture/fishery activities against the detailed Conservation Objectives set, and</p><p>  - Determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors</p><p>  The carrying out of detailed surveys of marine habitats and species has been completed.  Conservation Objectives have now been set for over 60 bays.  Appropriate Assessments have been completed in respect of Castlemaine Harbour, Dundalk Bay, Roaringwater Bay, Lough Swilly. Donegal Bay and Dungarvan Harbour. Appropriate Assessments are currently underway in a further six bays. </p><p>  This process is achieving meaningful results.  In 2013, I made a total of 137 licence determinations, of which approximately 120 were in respect of sites in 'Natura' areas.  I expect to be in a position to make in excess of 200 determinations in 2014.</p><p>  The Appropriate Assessment process represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State.  </p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that ultimately questions of price and market specification are matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle and it is neither appropriate nor possible for me to intervene directly on these issues. </p><p>  My Department does not monitor prices at retail level but we are aware that there are differences paid at market and retail level both here and in other countries including the UK.  However, it is not appropriate or possible for me to intervene directly in these matters.</p><p>  With regard to prices, it should be noted that Irish beef prices were 106% of the EU average in 2013.  The average price change over the first 10 weeks of this year is an approximate 1.8% reduction but it must be remembered that it is common for prices to decrease slightly in the first quarter of any year.  It should also be noted that with the exception of 2013 the prices paid in the first 10 weeks of 2014 for Irish cattle are comparable to 2012 and significantly in excess of prices paid from 2008-2011.</p><p>  With regard to the price differential between Irish and UK cattle, a number of factors have been identified to explain why Irish-born cattle command lower prices than their British equivalents.  These include a British consumer preference for indigenous product as well as additional transport and processing costs in supplying that market. Ireland's trade with Britain accounts for 53% of our beef export volumes, worth &euro;1.1 billion and, at around 250,000 tonnes in 2013, is equivalent to 750,000 cattle with a high level of penetration in the multiple retail sector.</p><p>  The potential to grow the live trade to Britain is also constrained by the buying specification operated by the retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in the UK.  The retailers' longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately.  This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country.  In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant.  Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. </p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, there are no indications that their marketing policy is likely to be reversed soon. Nevertheless, Bord Bia in its ongoing interactions with British customers will continue to pursue all opportunities, to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.</p><p>  In relation to the current difficulties between farmers and processors I recently met with both farmer representatives and processers to discuss the current situation. Following that interaction, I am hopeful that the factories, in collaboration with the farming bodies, will be able to resolve the various issues that have lately caused difficulties for some producers.  At my request, Meat Industry Ireland (MII) member companies have kept their livestock offices open to deal with farmers with any particular queries or concerns on the marketing of their stock.  MII member companies have made available contact details for each of their main plants to enable farmers to phone them directly.</p></reply>

On the basis of previous experience in implementing agri-environmental schemes, I decided on a maximum payment of &euro;4,000 per annum.  This represents a welcome support to farmers operating to the highest environmental standards.</p><p>  I was very pleased with the interest shown in the Scheme.  There are currently 5,963 farmers in AEOS 3, bringing the total number taking part in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme to around 20,000.  These farmers play a valuable role as custodians of our landscape.  Their commitment to farming systems which deliver public goods builds on the success of previous agri-environmental schemes such as REPS.  They are contributing to a sustainable future for farming in Ireland, and will assist with addressing the challenging environmental issues we face, such as loss of biodiversity, water quality and climate change.</p><p>  My Department has made payments of &euro;43.41m to AEOS 1 and 2 participants and &euro;152.33m to REPS participants for the 2013 year, which represents a very significant disbursement of funds to the agri-environment farming sector.  These payments are subject to very stringent EU audit standards, which is to be expected given that these are co-funded Schemes.  All area-based schemes under the Rural Development Programme, 2007-13, are subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications, including cross checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, to be completed before payments can issue.  These rigorous procedures, together with on-farm inspections, apply equally to AEOS 3, and are necessary to ensure that applications meet the scheme conditions and cross-compliance requirements. </p><p>  It takes time to put these systems in place for any new Scheme, as there is a great deal of initial checking of applications and resolution of queries arising which must be carried out before progressing to payment stage.  I am pleased to say that these checks are now well underway for AEOS 3 and I anticipate that payments for AEOS 3 in respect of 2013 will commence shortly.  In line with the governing Regulations, the payments will issue in two tranches,  a 75% payment and  a 25% payment. </p></reply>

In addition, my Department kept in contact with farm organisations through the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, whose members on the ground were well placed to assess the situation.</p><p>  I also requested that Teagasc provide practical advice to all farmers on steps which could be taken to deal with their particular problems.  I know that some farmers were particularly concerned that slurry tanks were almost full and ground conditions not suitable for spreading and Teagasc advisers were on hand to provide advice on how to address such situations. </p><p>  I welcome the recent improvement in the weather which should lead to an improvement in ground conditions.  On drier ground, this will allow some field work to be carried out and provide opportunities to reduce pressure on slurry storage tanks and to apply some early fertiliser. </p><p>  Farmers still need to be careful to budget their remaining fodder stocks.  I know that fodder reserves remain available within the country but it is critical that stocks are well managed and stretched as much as possible.</p><p>  On 12 February, I announced a temporary, one-off scheme of assistance to lobster and shrimp pot fishermen for the replacement of lobster and shrimp pots lost or destroyed in the recent extreme storm events.  The Scheme is focussed on smaller inshore fishermen and will be limited to vessels under 15 metres and will be administered by BIM.  I set aside a maximum budget within my Department for this scheme of &euro;1.5 million.</p><p>  Last week I announced details of a &euro;23m package for the repair of public owned piers, harbours and slipways damaged during the winter storms and for investment in the ongoing development of Ireland&rsquo;s public harbour network.</p><p>  Of the &euro;23m, &euro;8.5m is earmarked for 115 storm damaged piers and harbours to assist eleven Local Authorities and my Department to repair storm damaged infrastructure.  This figure is further broken down as &euro;7m for 111 projects to repair storm damaged harbours, piers and slipways owned by Local Authority and &euro;1.5m for remediation work at four non-Fishery Harbour Centres owned by my Department including &euro;1.3m for North Harbour, Cape Clear. </p><p>  In addition, a further &euro;14.63m of funding is being provided for harbour development in 2014 and this represents a significant increase on the level of funding provided in 2013. &euro;11.63m of this is allocated towards safety, maintenance and new development works at six Fishery Harbour Centres at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Dingle, Ros a Mh&iacute;l and Killybegs, in addition to infrastructural improvement works at &ldquo;bull nose&rdquo; pier, North Harbour, Cape Clear.  This works also includes &euro;4m for dredging works at Dunmore East. &euro;3m is being allocated for Local Authority Harbour Development and Marine Leisure programmes.  My Department is contacting the relevant Local Authorities in relation to applications under this element of the Programme.</p><p>  This is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing our fishery harbours for the benefit of our fishing industry, seafood processing sector, other ancillary marine industries, tenants and the wider community.  It is part of an ongoing and long term strategy to develop and improve the facilities at our Fishery Harbour Centres and other public harbours around our coast.  This package will help to ensure that this important infrastructure is fit for purpose in the modern era and will bring significant added value to local communities and much welcome jobs and economic activity.</p></reply>

Any farmer who was entitled to receive a direct payment in 2013 (Single Payment, Grassland Sheep Scheme, Burren Life Scheme, Beef Data Scheme) is automatically eligible to receive an allocation of new entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015. </p><p>  Where lessors have leased out all of their entitlements for a period which includes the 2013 scheme year (or leased out a portion of their entitlements but did not draw down a direct payment in 2013) they will not have an automatic &lsquo;allocation right&rsquo; and consequently would not have access to the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015. As a consequence, these 100% lessors will neither be eligible to establish entitlements in their own right, nor can they enter into a Private Contract Clause to transfer entitlements to the lessee.</p><p>  The value of such leased entitlements will be lost to both lessor and lessee unless the entitlements in question are transferred permanently by sale or gift before 15 May 2014. My Department is writing to all persons impacted by this scenario to advise them of their options.  </p><p>  A fundamental principle of the Regulation that will govern the new Basic Payment Scheme is that direct payments should only issue to active farmers. This is a principle that was endorsed by all farming organisations and indeed by the Deputy in his submission regarding the application of direct payments in Ireland.  </p><p>Of the 6,417 herd owners involved, forty-three percent involve leases of three or more years. Of those who entered into leases in the period 2012, 2013 and 2014, 56% entered into leases of three years or more. These figures indicate that very high percentages of these lessors entered into contracts which effectively excluded them from active farming for extensive periods and that they had, in effect,   withdrawn from active farming. </p><p>  It is estimated that 1,968 cases relate to leases between family members where it is presumed a transfer can be easily arranged. There are 335 cases which involve leases to a Company where in most cases the lessor is also the director of the Company. </p><p>  In conclusion, the greater majority of cases relate to entitlements held by persons who are no longer active farmers or to family members or companies where transfers can be arranged without difficulty. All lessors have the option to sell their entitlements in 2014 at prices dictated by the market. The issue of compensation for such persons does not arise. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-26a.61.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032600082#WRD01300"><p> A three party agreement on the management of the mackerel stock in the North East Atlantic involving the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands was agreed on the 12th   of March in London following lengthy discussions over many months and indeed years. Iceland, despite being involved in all of the negotiations is not party to this agreement. </p><p>  The key elements of the agreement are as follows:</p><p>  - The Total Allowable catch has been set at 1.24m tonnes for 2014. In subsequent years, it shall be based on the levels advised by ICES.</p><p>  - The agreement is for 5 years</p><p>  - 12.6% of the TAC has been allocated to Faroes.</p><p>  - A further 15.6% has been held as a Coastal State and Fishing Party reserve.   This would cover a possible accession of Iceland to the agreement as well as the interests of Russia and Greenland.</p><p>  I can&rsquo;t support the final agreement because of the unacceptably high shares allocated to the Faroe Islands and the level set aside for a reserve. However, there are aspects to this agreement that I can welcome, such as that there is no access to EU waters for Iceland, access for Norway has been restricted, the relative shares of the EU &amp;amp; Norway have been respected with each paying proportionately to cover the new arrangements.  In addition, the quota for the Irish fleet for 2014 has increased by over 60% to 105,000 tonnes.</p><p>  I have always been supportive of a deal that would bring an end to the irresponsible and excessive fishing of the mackerel stock that we have seen over the past five years.  This new five year agreement which, while far from ideal, does at least ensure that in line with the EU and Norway, the Faroese will be subject to fixed quotas set on the basis of ICES advice, which will protect against the previous dangerously high levels of fishing in which they participated.  </p><p>  However, I am disappointed with the fact that the final outcome gave the Faroe Islands a significantly increased 12.6% share of the stock.  The 15.6% reserve is intended to cover Iceland, Greenland and Russia but as all these parties are operating outside a formal agreement, there can be no confidence that they will respect even this very generous allocation.</p><p>  From an Irish perspective, I am disappointed with the high shares granted and set aside which appear to me to be a reward for irresponsible behaviour.    I consistently argued at Council and throughout these negotiations that the levels being proposed for these parties were too high and it is on that basis that I cannot support the overall deal. However, the European Commission and the other EU Mackerel Member States, in particular the UK who are the largest mackerel quota holder in the EU, were willing to accept the granting of those levels of share to the Faroes and the share set aside in the reserve.  </p><p>  To conclude, I don&rsquo;t like the shares which we have transferred. I was prepared to concede significant share to both Iceland and Faeroes in the interests of stability and sustainability but in my view there is no justification for the EU to have conceded as much as we now have.  The share for Faroes is, unfortunately, now fixed.  I will be working hard to ensure that in negotiations to come we will all have learnt lessons and that EU Member States work more effectively together to better protect the Union share of this vital resource. </p></reply>

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year. Details of these inspections and the regulations involved are published in the Terms and Conditions of the schemes which are sent to every applicant annually.</p><p>  These inspections are a necessary requirement in order to draw down approximately &euro;1.7 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances. The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office and this ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements. In abiding with the findings of these audits my Department ensures that these inspections are conducted in a fair and equitable manner and in full accordance with the legislative provisions. Inspecting officers are very experienced and are regularly trained to ensure that they carry out inspections in a professional manner. In implementing the inspection programme, my Department takes maximum possible account of the realities of farming. </p><p>Appropriate appeal mechanisms are in place to protect the interests of farmers if they have difficulties with the inspection findings or if they consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements. Under this process a farmer may initially seek to have the inspection outcome reviewed internally by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer. Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman, which brings an entirely external and visibly independent dimension to the process.   </p></reply>

With regard to any suspected manipulation of the market I would ask the Deputy to bring forward any information or evidence he has in this regard to the Competition Authority of Ireland who have the power to investigate such matters.</p><p>  My Department monitors prices paid for cattle in Ireland and it should be noted that Irish beef prices were 106% of the EU average in 2013. The average price change over the first 10 weeks of this year is an approximate 1.8% reduction but it must be remembered that it is common for prices to decrease slightly in the first quarter of any year. It should also be noted that with the exception of 2013 the prices paid in the first 10 weeks of 2014 for Irish cattle are comparable to 2012 and significantly in excess of prices paid from 2008-2011.Nevertheless it is clear that for some farmers with certain categories of animals, prices has softened significantly in the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>  In this context I met with both farmer representatives and processors this month to discuss the current situation. Following that interaction, I called on the factories, in collaboration with the farming bodies, to work together to resolve the various issues that have lately caused difficulties for some producers. At my request, Meat Industry Ireland (MII) member companies have kept their livestock offices open to deal with farmers with any particular queries or concerns on the marketing of their stock.  MII member companies have made available contact details for each of their main plants to enable farmers to phone them directly.</p><p>  The relationship between processors and farmers is an interdependent one. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. The current situation clearly underlines the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain and to address supply chain issues in such a context. An industry-led solution to the current uncertainty is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.</p><p>  As a signal of this Government&rsquo;s continued support for the beef sector I recently announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014. Among the measures in this investment package are &euro;23m for a Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the suckler beef sector. It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, I had a number of business engagements in both Australia and New Zealand and I secured meetings with the Agriculture Ministers of both countries.</p><p>  In Australia I had the opportunity to meet with Irish food companies operating in Australia and to engage with key business figures in the agri-food sector.  I also had a useful discussion with the Australian Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce concerning the trade links between our two countries and the current developments in international trade relations, particularly in the agri-food sector.  It may not be generally known that agri-food and related exports to Australia were valued at &euro;86 million in 2014.  Exports of thoroughbred horses comprise the bulk of these exports although we also have a small trade in dairy products, beverages and, since the market was reopened in March of last year, in pigmeat. Over the medium term pigmeat exports from Ireland to Australia are targeted to reach around 10,000 tonnes per year.</p><p>  My time in New Zealand was quite limited but I did have the opportunity to meet the New Zealand Minister for Primary Industries, Nathan Guy.  Although trade between Ireland and New Zealand is minuscule in both directions, we share a lot of common ground in terms of our production systems, notably in the dairy sector, and on climate change.  We had a good discussion on both of these issues.  We also explored the possibility of cooperation and exchanges between Teagasc and its equivalent in New Zealand, including the possibility of provision of services and expertise in the areas of agricultural outreach, extension and advice.</p><p>  I also had a very useful and constructive meeting with Fonterra, the New Zealand farmer-owned cooperative that is the world&rsquo;s leading dairy exporter. We discussed the growing demand worldwide for protein-based products and the role that countries such as Ireland and New Zealand can play in producing dairy products in an environmentally sustainable way, to address the issue of food security without damaging the environment.  We concluded that there is an opportunity for quality producers such as Ireland and New Zealand to benefit from this additional demand in a spirit of collaboration and cooperation that contributes positively to both economies while helping to address global food security challenges in an environmentally and economically sustainable way.</p></reply>

In accordance with the EU Regulations, this instrument establishes a point system for the Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy by a vessel is detected within the Exclusive Fishery Limits of the State or for an Irish vessel, wherever it may be. The accumulation of points for persistent serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy will lead to the suspension of a sea fishing boat licence for a period from 2 months to one year.

This fleet reference level remains the same regardless of the loss of capacity arising from the application of penalty points regime to any individual license holder.

Persons who meet the definition of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; under the new Direct Payment Regulation will be eligible both to apply to the National Reserve for an allocation of entitlements or a top-up on the value of existing entitlements and also to participate in the Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme.</p><p>  The essential purpose of the Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme is to assist young farmers in the initial stages of establishing a farming enterprise in their own name and to encourage generational renewal. It is for this reason that the payment is restricted to those who are establishing or have established such a holding in the previous five years. In addition, the restricting of the payment to a maximum of five years will make it possible to support those young farmers who will come on-stream in the years subsequent to 2015.</p><p>  Most farmers who have been farming for more than five years hold existing entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme. Where such farmers hold low value entitlements they will benefit significantly from the process of convergence that will apply under the Basic Payment Scheme. The purpose of the convergence model adopted by Ireland is to achieve a phased redistribution of payments between those who currently hold high value entitlements and those who hold low value entitlements. If such farmers have never held entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme, but were actively farming in 2013, they will be allocated new entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 and will benefit from the convergence process.</p><p>  In relation to Pillar 2, I have recently published a consultation document setting out proposed measure outlines for inclusion in the new Rural Development Programme, 2014-2020.  These proposals have been the subject of a public consultation and include an increased aid intensity of 60% for young farmers under the proposed support for capital investment on farms, compared to a 40% support rate for all other farmers.  A young farmer is defined in the Rural Development Regulation as &ldquo;a person who is no more than 40 years of age at the moment of submitting the application, possesses adequate occupational skills and competence and is setting up for the first time in an agricultural holding as head of that holding.&rdquo;  However, in relation to the 60% rate of aid for capital investment, the Regulation does provide for the flexibility to include young farmers who have set up in the 5 years preceding the application for support.</p><p>  It should be noted, however, that farmers under 40 who have set up in their holding more than five years ago will of course remain eligible to apply for the full range of measures in the new RDP.</p></reply>

These surveys are undertaken for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive by IPSOS MRBI. The survey for 2012 found that 13% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland are illicit. The comparable figure for 2011 was 14%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained, as a result of the extensive action being taken against the smuggling and sale of illicit product. A further survey was carried out at the end of 2013 and the results of this will be available in the near future.</p><p>  The Deputy will of course appreciate that estimating the scale of any illegal activity and the resultant tax loss is difficult. I am however satisfied that the IPSOS MRBI survey is the best indicator of the extent of the market in illicit cigarettes. This is because of the methodologies used and the consistent manner in which the survey has been undertaken over a number of years. In addition, the survey methodology is, unlike other methodologies such as empty pack surveys, capable of distinguishing between legal personal imports and illicit cigarettes. The survey is also geographically representative and, unlike others, takes social class, age, gender and nationality into account.</p><p>  I am advised also that combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners. Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, in the on-going programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.</p><p>  In addition, legislative action has been taken over recent years to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners have the requisite powers to respond effectively to the problem of the illegal tobacco trade. The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products. The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences for involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production.  Provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production.</p><p>  That Act also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda, may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.</p><p>  As well as those changes to primary law Ireland, in accordance with EU Directive 2008/118/EU, introduced a quantitative restriction, with effect from 1 January 2014, on the number of cigarettes that may be brought into the State for personal use by individuals travelling from Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania.  The Excise Duty on Cigarettes (Quantitative Restrictions) Order 2013 (S.I. No. 553 of 2013) provides that the number of tax-paid cigarettes that may be brought into Ireland for personal use by individuals travelling from those Member States, without payment of further excise duty in Ireland, is restricted to 300.  Anyone with cigarettes in excess of that quantity must declare them to a Revenue Officer and pay the appropriate excise duty.  This restriction will remain in place until 31 December 2017 or until such time as the particular Member State has achieved the required EU minimum tax levels, whichever is the earlier.</p></reply>

The Eurogroup meeting of 20 June 2013 agreed on the main features of the European Stability Mechanism's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument or DRI. The DRI will come into effect when the SSM is in place and operational. This is not expected to take place until late in the current year.</p><p>  The operational framework of the DRI has been discussed at ministerial level and the aim is to complete this discussion as soon as possible in order to allow the ESM Member States sufficient time to complete any necessary national procedures before the SSM comes into effect later this year.  The overall Banking Union proposal involves an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks in the form of the SSM; harmonised EU rules on deposit guarantee schemes ('DGS'); a European resolution scheme commonly referred to as the Bank Recovery &amp;amp; Resolution Directive (BRRD) and; a<b></b>Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM)<b></b>to coordinate the application of resolution tools to banks under the Banking Union. </p><p>  As you are aware, one of the core objectives of Banking Union is to break the link between the sovereign and the banking sector by strengthening the banking system and making it more resilient. A key feature is the need to provide authorities with a credible set of tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in an unsound or failing bank so as to ensure the continuity of a bank's critical financial and economic functions whilst minimising the impact of a bank's failure on the economy and financial system, by requiring that shareholders bear losses first followed by creditors while at the same time minimising the costs for taxpayers. </p><p>  Banking supervision in the EU is currently the responsibility of the Member States. However, the financial crisis showed that national supervision has not always been effective in spotting problems in banks. Also it showed how quickly problems in the financial sector of one country can spread to another i.e. contagion. Therefore, the European Commission has overseen the establishment of the SSM. The SSM will act as a central authority that oversees the key aspects of the activities of banks in the euro area. This is particularly important in order to ensure an effective overview of trans-national banking groups, which often have subsidiaries in many countries. The SSM is the basis for the next steps towards the banking union. This reflects the principle that the ESM will have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly when the SSM is in place and operational.</p><p>  The objective of the ESM's DRI will be to preserve the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its Member States in line with Article 3 of the ESM Treaty, and to help remove the risk of contagion from the financial sector to the sovereign by allowing the recapitalisation of institutions directly.  I remain confident that the commitment made by the EU HoSG in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to ensure that resolution can take place at the same level as supervision, rather than being conducted at national level.  It is considered as an important contributing factor to breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.</p><p>  The SRM will allow decisions to be made in a more objective and independent fashion than if they were been made by national supervisors. The proposal which has been agreed sees the SRM taking its decisions in line with the principles of resolution set out in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive in particular that shareholders and creditors should bear the costs of resolution before any external funding is granted, and private sector solutions should be found instead of using taxpayers' money.  It is felt that in most scenarios, contributions by shareholders and creditors should be sufficient to finance resolution. If exceptionally, additional resources were needed a Single Resolution Fund with a target level of 1% of covered deposits within the Banking Union (approx. &euro;55bn) will come into place as a last resort to finance the bank resolution process.</p><p>  In the General Council approach reached on SRM at the extraordinary ECOFIN on 18 Dec, it was agreed that as part of the overall compromise that aspects of the SRM relating to financing be carved out of the Regulation, in particular the transfer of contributions from national resolution funds to national compartments in the SRM, and gradual mutualisation of national compartments in the SRM over a 10 year period. This approach was adopted because certain member states  were not satisfied that Article 114 provided an appropriate legal basis for the operation of the Single Resolution Fund. It was agreed that an Intergovernmental Agreement would cover these matters.</p><p>  Under the recently reached agreement between the Greek Presidency and the European Parliament, the transition period to a fully mutualized SRF has been reduced to 8 years. In addition the pace of mutualisation has been significantly increased in such a way that within two years 60% mutualisation will occur with the balance being achieved in a linear fashion up until the end of year 8. What this means in practical terms is that if a bank is failing or likely to fail the first step is that the bail-in rules will be applied to losses. If there are still losses to be absorbed, the next point of contribution will be the funds within the Member State's national compartment in the SRF, followed by the mutualised part of the national compartments of other Member States.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-26a.108.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032600085#WRG00400"><p>The issue of flood cover, its availability and its cost, is one with which I am familiar. I am also very conscious of the difficulties that the absence of such cover can cause to householders and businesses.  However, it should be noted that the decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved.  Neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can require a company to change its rates or prohibit a company from doing so.</p><p>  An insurance company's commercial decision to provide new or renewed flood cover is based on a proper assessment of the risks it is accepting and the making of adequate provisioning to meet these risks.  It is a matter for the industry to set its premiums and make provisions at the appropriate level to ensure that it can cope with flooding issues. Furthermore, as a matter of course, insurance companies carry out reviews of the risks they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make decisions to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk.</p><p>  Government policy in relation to flooding aims to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible. The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences based on a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p><p>  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016. Works are completed on a prioritised basis. Because of the cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, this approach will see benefits over the medium and long term.  Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.</p><p>  The OPW and Insurance Ireland agreed earlier this week on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and this is expected to allow the insurance industry a much greater understanding of the extent of the protection provided by flood defence works and will allow them to reflect this in the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed.</p><p>  My Department is also undertaking a review of measures to address the availability of flood insurance cover, including the experience and proposals in other countries. In assessing these, care has to be taken that the proposed solutions do not put in place arrangements which, over time, would weaken the provision of insurance cover by the market with possible negative long-term consequences for the economy.</p></reply>

The House was also informed that the Chief State Solicitor was the solicitor on record acting for all State defendants and that the case was being vigorously defended by the Chief State Solicitor. I am advised that the High Court, on the application of the State defendants, made an Order in July 2013 dismissing the Plaintiff s claim on the grounds that it was frivolous and vexatious and disclosed no cause of action against the Defendants. This decision is under appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>  I am also advised that another person is challenging the constitutionality of the Local Property Tax. This challenge is at an early stage and has not yet been set down for hearing in the High Court.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the LPT obligations of a liable person are not impacted by whether the person is in the process of challenging the legality or the constitutionality of LPT in the courts. Accordingly, the person is still obliged to file an LPT Return and make arrangements to pay the tax due, including any household charge arrears. Where liable persons file their returns and pay their LPT liability, including household charge arrears, on or before 31 March 2014, they will not incur interest or penalties. If by that date a person has not met his or her obligations, any outstanding LPT liabilities, including household charge arrears will be pursued, where necessary, using the range of collection/enforcement powers at Revenue s disposal which include, mandatory deduction at source from salary, various occupational pensions or from certain Government payments.</p><p>  With regard to Question [14287/14], I assume that the Deputy is referring to payment of LPT or the household charge when talking about a person  appealing a revenue debt . I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as LPT is a self-assessed tax, it is a matter for the liable person to determine the amount of LPT due based on his or her valuation of the residential property, and to make arrangements to file their LPT Return and pay the tax on the basis of their self-assessment.</p><p>  In common with other self-assessed taxes, the LPT Return as filed by the taxpayer is generally accepted by Revenue in the first instance.  If, subsequently, Revenue is dissatisfied with any of the details in the LPT Return such that the LPT liability of the property owner has been understated, Revenue may raise a formal notice of assessment to address any of the issues in question.  In these circumstances, provided the tax declared by the property owner in their LPT return has been paid in full, the LPT legislation allows a right of appeal by the owner to the Appeal Commissioners.  Revenue will suspend all enforcement action against any disputed amount, including mandatory deduction at source from wages and other income sources, until the appeal has been determined. Once the appeal is determined, if the case is found in Revenue s favour, the property owner will be liable to pay the additional tax due plus any interest that may have accrued.</p></reply>

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that Member States have discretionary power to fix conditions and limitations on the exemption from VAT for certain forms of gambling.  However, these conditions and limitations are constrained by ECJ jurisprudence such as the Rank case (C-259/10) which found that the principle of fiscal neutrality was breached by UK VAT law when it treated differently for VAT purposes certain types of gambling (being mechanised cash bingo and slot machines), where the services were identical or similar from the perspective of the consumer, and met the same needs of the consumer. </p><p>  Sports bets placed in bookie shops or online fall within the distinction in the Rank case. It is not possible to charge VAT on a bet on the outcome of a race or the outcome of a match depending on the medium through which the bet was waged.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013, once enacted, will introduce a new licensing and taxation regime for remote (online) bookmakers and betting intermediaries (betting exchanges) who enter into bets with persons in the State and provide, among other things, certainty in relation to the VAT treatment of such services. </p><p>  Electronically supplied services are taxable at the standard rate in each EU Member State, unless a specific exemption applies. For example, if gambling is exempt in an EU Member State, it would also be exempt in that EU Member State if it is supplied as an electronically supplied service. Accordingly, although the place of supply of services to non-taxable persons from online bookies operating from Gibraltar is Ireland, VAT is not charged on the supply as such supplies are primarily exempt from VAT in Ireland.</p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, once enacted, should ensure that all comparable bookmakers activities offered in the State are subject to betting tax and exempt from VAT.</p></reply>

Changes to the approach by which the output gap is estimated were endorsed by a high-level committee (the Economic Policy Committee) on March 19th 2014. This new methodology will form the revised harmonised approach which the European Commission will apply in their forthcoming Spring 2014 forecasts. It will also form the basis for their subsequent assessment of Member States Stability Programme Updates.</p><p>  The endorsed changes are technical in nature. Essentially they involve a shift in how labour market slack is estimated. The change alters how structural unemployment is calculated with implications for potential labour supply and the measurement of the output gap. Ireland is one of the Member States for whom this change significantly impacts the estimated level of structural unemployment. It produces a significantly lower estimate of the so called 'natural' unemployment rate for a number of countries (Spain, Ireland and Portugal in particular).</p><p>  In light of these significant methodological revisions, previous estimates of the output gap now need to be revised. My Department will publish an updated assessment of the output gap path in the forthcoming Stability Programme Update. Fiscal policy was last set out at Budget time and will be re-articulated in the context of the forthcoming Stability Programme Update (SPU).</p><p>  My Department intends to detail the main methodological features of these output gap changes and will set out the implications for the structural budget balance in the SPU.</p></reply>

A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.     </p><p>  In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2013, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).  Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,500.  Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,250.  Thus, for example, a family with two siblings attending college on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;8,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;2,300 made up as follows:<table><tr><th>Tuition fees </th><th>&euro;16,000</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Capped at </td><td>&euro;14,000 Less &euro;2,500</td><td>&euro;11,500 @ 20% = &euro;2,300</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The most recent data available is therefore in respect of the last quarter (December) in 2013. Staff numbers are reported in two categories: academic and non-academic.</p><p>  The following data pertains in respect of UCC, TCD, UCG and the University of Limerick (UL) at the end of Q4 2013:</p><p>UCC : 954 Non Academic and 681 Academic staff.</p><p>TCD : 1020 Non Academic and 649 Academic staff.</p><p>UCG: 757 Non Academic and 715 Academic staff.</p><p>UL: 465 Non Academic and 503 Academic staff.</p><p>  It should be noted that non-academic staff includes a range of categories of support staff in an institution, including administrative staff. Non-academic staff are involved in student focused functions such as student admissions and registration, campus service centres, assessment and library as well as the more traditional back office functions such as ICT support, finance and payroll.   The non-academic category of staff may also include support staff involved in activities related to research such as administrative support and laboratory technicians.</p><p>  The following table outlines the numbers of Lecturer and Senior Lecturer grade staff in these 4 institutions.  Data relating to the contact hours that lecturers have with students is still being collated by the Higher Education Authority and I will arrange that this information be forwarded to the deputy as soon as its to hand.</p><p>Number of Lecturer grade staff in NUIG, UCC, UL and TCD</p><p><b>31st December 2013</b><table><tr><th><b>Grade</b></th><th><b>NUIG</b></th><th><b>UCC</b></th><th><b>UL</b></th><th><b>TCD</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Lecturer</b></td><td>391.74</td><td>426.87</td><td>310.2</td><td>336.48</td></tr><tr><td><b>Senior Lecturer</b></td><td>84.75</td><td>120.58</td><td>108</td><td>148.88</td></tr><tr><td><b>Clinical Lecturer</b></td><td>2.61</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td><b>Part-Time Lecturer</b></td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td>15.09</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>479.1</b></td><td><b>547.45</b></td><td><b>418.2</b></td><td><b>500.45</b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent/CID holding teachers to other schools that have vacancies.  The redeployment of all surplus permanent/CID holding teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.  Thereafter the recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).  The pilot voluntary redeployment scheme for the 201415 school year is confined to schools in the Connaught region.  This pilot voluntary redeployment scheme will only be used if it facilitates the redeployment of a surplus permanent/CID holding teacher from a school.

Details of the number of site visits paid in each of the years in question is set out in the following tabular statement.  However, for reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, details of such visits are provided on a county by county basis only. </p><p>  County Galway has had particular success in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment particularly in the areas of Medical Technologies and ICT.  At present there are 60 IDA Ireland client companies in Galway City and County employing over 13,600 people in full and part time employment.  In the three year period from 2011 to 2013, almost 4,000 new jobs were created in IDA Ireland client companies in County Galway.  Details of the number of jobs created in each of the three years is set out in the following tabular statement. </p><p>  As a result of this inward investment, significant scale and capability has been established underpinning existing industry clusters such as the Medical Technologies cluster in Galway.  The emphasis for IDA Ireland is to continue to engage the existing base of multinationals in Galway and the West Region as a whole to ensure opportunities are realised in respect of job retention, creation and growth but with a particular focus on driving the transformation agenda within the existing client base making them more competitive in a global context thus ensuring ongoing operational sustainability.  Approximately 70% of all FDI won on an annual basis comes from the existing client base. </p><p>  Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with my Department to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of enterprise agencies and the other regional stakeholders in building enterprise based on sustainable competitive advantage of the region.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland's strengths in attracting FDI and any changes to the EU's State Aid Rules, which will come into effect on 1 July 2014.  The results of these two exercises will form the basis of IDA Ireland's strategy from 2015 onwards.</p><p><b>Table 1 showing the number of IDA sponsored site visits by potential Investors to County Galway (incl.

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities provides that the incoming Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the CEB will be the designated Head of LEO and will have a direct reporting relationship with the County Manager.  In organisational terms, the LEO will be a dedicated Unit within the Local Authority by virtue of having its own specific funding stream, branding, website and metrics and by conducting its work on the basis of the SLA.  Therefore, as there will be no Board going forward to the new LEO structure, the position of CEO will not arise.  It is not intended, or envisaged, that the LEO service to local business will cause displacement of already existing private sector service provision.

Reviews of customer income, capital, investments and other relevant circumstances are undertaken on an on-going basis.</p><p>  Customers are required to notify the Department of any change in their circumstances and to cooperate with any reviews of their entitlement.</p><p>  The person concerned was awarded carer&rsquo;s allowance with effect from 6th May 2010. In order to review the continuing eligibility of the person in question to carer's allowance, a form was issued to him for completion on the 24th July 2013 and, when it was not returned, a reminder was issued on 31st August 2013. The completed form was received back from the person in question on the 7th of November 2013.  On foot of the response, the file was sent to a social welfare investigative officer to interview the person and to establish their means. Following the review a deciding officer decided that the means of the person in question exceeded the statutory limit for the period from 5th of January 2012 to 15th of January 2014 and that, as a result, he was not entitled to carer&rsquo;s allowance.    </p><p>  The person in question was notified of this decision on 4th March 2014, the reason for it and of his right of review or appeal. This revised decision results in an overpayment of &euro;21,624.00 and this sum is recoverable by the department.

This provision also applies to recipients of widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory) pension.  </p><p>  Where a person is in receipt of one-parent family payment by virtue of one qualified child and that child dies, the total weekly one-parent family payment will also continue for a period of six weeks.</p><p>  Where a carer was in receipt of a carer's allowance or carer's benefit (and where the care recipient was not a spouse or partner) and the care recipient is now deceased, payment of the carer's benefit or carer's allowance continues to be made for a period of six weeks after the date of death of the care recipient.</p><p>  Also, it should be noted that the period may be less than six weeks in certain cases.  For example, if a surviving spouse or parent/guardian is in receipt of illness benefit and returns to work before the end of the six week period, the benefit is no longer payable.</p><p>  The relevant payments are as follows:</p><p>  - Blind pension;</p><p>  - Carer's allowance;</p><p>  - Carer's benefit;</p><p>  - Death benefit under the injury benefit scheme;</p><p>  - Disability allowance;</p><p>  - Farm assist;</p><p>  - Illness benefit;</p><p>  - Incapacity supplement;</p><p>  - Injury benefit;</p><p>  - Invalidity pension;</p><p>  - Jobseekers allowance;</p><p>  - Jobseekers benefit;</p><p>  - One parent family payment;</p><p>  - Pre-retirement allowance;</p><p>  - State pension (contributory);</p><p>  - State pension (transition);</p><p>  - State pension (non-contributory);</p><p>  - Supplementary welfare allowance.</p></reply>

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments.  The telephone allowance was abolished from 1 January 2014.  I have no plans to introduce a new allowance to replace it.</p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s clients and particularly those who are living alone.  In Budget 2014, I was able to maintain the rate of the living alone allowance at &euro;7.70 per week.  While the decision to abolish the telephone allowance was a difficult one, it allowed the Government to fully maintain the other elements of the household benefits package, such as the free electricity/gas allowance and the free television licence.  These are very valuable supports for clients.  We have also maintained the value of the fuel allowance and free travel. </p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full.  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon, and a landline service was the only option available to the client.  The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone, broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. </p><p>  The Department currently provides both a landline and a lo-call option for customers for the main scheme areas.  In addition the website also alerts the public to the fact that lo-call numbers can attract different tariffs depending on the operator of the phone service.  The Department is currently reviewing the use of lo-call telephone services which may not be available on certain telephone plans, with a view to improving access for the public.  The review is at an early stage.</p></reply>

The upgrades are delivered free of charge to the customer. The scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department. To raise awareness and invite applications to the scheme from eligible households, mailshots are periodically delivered through direct marketing. These mailshots are issued in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection and such mailshots have proved highly successful in identifying eligible households in other counties. Mailshots have been previously delivered in Carlow, Clare, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Tipperary, Westmeath and Wicklow.  In March, a mailshot was issued to Fuel Allowance recipients in counties Roscommon, Leitrim and Longford. There are three SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs) delivering the Warmer Homes Scheme in these counties, two of which are Local Development Partnership Companies. SEAI is not excluding these CBOs in any way from the scheme. All three CBOs were advised in advance of the mailshot and will receive applications that result from the mailshot where they are unable to generate applications through their own resources. </p></reply>

I refer to the reply given to Questions Nos. 137 and 138 dated 12 February 2014 which deals comprehensively with the concerns raised in this correspondence.</p><p>  On 5 February 2014 the Minister for Education and Skills wrote to me seeking that the planned implementation date of 1 March 2014 be deferred by at least 12 months, to ensure the planned school building programme is not put at risk. </p><p>  My Department immediately consulted with relevant Departments/agencies represented on the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC), in relation to the implications of the Regulations for the public capital programme. Several Departments/Agencies, including the Department of Education and Skills, the National Development Finance Agency and the Health Services Executive, expressed concerns that the new requirements may cause delays in the Public Capital Programme. Large-scale public infrastructure projects, in particular, are prone to costly delays due to strict national and EU procurement rules which do not generally apply to private sector projects. Other agencies, notably the OPW, reported that the necessary arrangements were in place to administer contracts in accordance with the new requirements. </p><p>  Following discussions at GCCC level, an oversight group will be established to deal with issues arising in the first twelve months of the new arrangements. This will ensure that a process is in place to signal at an early date, and resolve, any difficulties in relation to public capital programme projects and major investment projects.</p><p>  On this basis, the Regulations were amended to provide for an alternative but equivalent means of complying with the requirements to assign a person to inspect and certify the works (the Assigned Certifier) in line with a plan lodged at commencement and implemented during construction. Subject to the oversight group&rsquo;s determination of the matter, this requirement may be fulfilled by lodgement of such inspection plan, inspection records and certificates as may be deemed appropriate and necessary by the group in order to demonstrate that compliance with the Building Regulations has been achieved for the building or works concerned.</p><p>  This alternative means of compliance applies to a limited range of public and privately owned buildings classified as first-, second- or third-level places of education; hospitals or primary care centres for which planning permission has already been obtained and for which contract documents will be in place before 1 November 2014 and works will commence before 1 March 2015. It does not amount to a deferral or a derogation of the requirements of the Building Regulations. The sole accommodation given is a n alternative means of compliance with the inspection and certification requirements fulfilled by the Assigned Certifier that will apply to a narrow range of buildings for a temporary period.</p><p>  I understand that in excess of 100 commencement notices have been lodged on the Building Control Management System since 1 March 2014 suggesting that the necessary arrangements for the successful implementation of the Regulations are in place and are working effectively in practice. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the concerns raised did not warrant a deferral of the necessary reform of the building control system and I have no plans to broaden the scope of transitional arrangements to other public sector or privately owned projects.</p></reply>

The chain of responsibility begins with the owner who, under SI No. 9 of 2014, must now sign the commencement notice and the notices of assignment of the Builder and of the Assigned Certifier.</p><p>  The notice of assignment of a builder requires the owner to declare they are satisfied that the assigned person is competent to undertake the works. The essential point is that the owner acts with responsibility in assigning a competent builder. In practice, this assigned person will be a sole trader, a company or a self- builder and their status is irrelevant once competence is assured.  If for any reason the assigned builder changes, the building owner is obliged to inform the local authority and to assign and notify a new builder.  The significance of this is that the assigned builder (and no one other than the assigned builder) must sign Part A of the relevant Certificate of Compliance on Completion.</p><p>  Where the person assigned is a firm, the signature must be signed by a Principal or Director i.e. it should not be signed by an employee.  This qualification of the signatory is only necessary in the case of a company.  Where a self- builder is acting on his or her own behalf there are no agents or intermediaries involved and the potential for confusion over legal responsibility does not therefore arise.</p></reply>

Comprehensive consultation documents were published, including Strengthening the Building Control System - A Document to inform public consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012 which sets out the context in which the reforms &ndash; as later signed into law in the form of S.I. No. 9 of 2014 &ndash; would operate and the regulatory impact of these for building owners and industry stakeholders. This document remains available on my Department&rsquo;s website, </p><p>  In summary terms, it can be said that the arrangements being put in place for the control of building activity may result in additional design, inspection, certification and, possibly, insurance costs which must ultimately be borne by the building owner/contracting authority. Such additional costs would be justified by the enhanced quality and standard of design and construction of the building project concerned in light of several notable instances of non-compliant buildings which failed to meet minimum building standards. It is anticipated that the statutory inspection process will reduce the incidences of defective works on site and the resultant associated costs of carrying out remedial works will reduce accordingly.</p><p>  Owners/developers will now be required to assign a competent person to inspect and certify the works. For buildings where this would not previously have been the case, it was estimated that this requirement could add between &euro;1,000 to &euro;3,000 per housing unit to the overall building costs. On practice, the costs of construction activity and related professional services are determined by market forces and I am precluded by trade and competition law from introducing any measures which would interfere with the normal functioning of the market in that regard.</p><p>  The construction industry in Ireland and the residential sector in particular includes an unusually high number of SMEs. A large proportion of the work of such firms involves repair, renewal and renovation work or extensions to existing dwellings. Such works less than 40 square metres do not come within the scope of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations. In addition such firms, operate as sub-contractors on larger projects. In such cases the impact and the administrative burden of the proposed regulations falls on the principal contractor. The impact of the proposed regulations on SMEs has thus been kept to a minimum.</p></reply>

In relation to the fees for registration it is likely that the amount of any such fees will, when the register is put on a statutory footing, be subject to the consent of the Minister and will be limited to covering the costs incurred by the registration body in administering the register which would include the costs of maintaining, accounting for, auditing, and quality assuring the register.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities.  The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.   </p><p>  Traditionally it has been difficult to quantify the number of homeless persons on an on-going basis; this is in part a consequence of the volatility within this cohort of housing need. The Pathway Accommodation and Support System (PASS) was extended nationally in 2013 and is now operational nationwide.  PASS will assist housing authorities to report on the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed and 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data.  These reports will be published on my Department's website as soon as they are available.   </p><p>In February 2013 I published the Government&rsquo;s Homelessness Policy Statement in which the aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.   </p><p>The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions, has submitted its first report to me.  The report considered the prevention of homelessness as well as families presenting as homeless.  A copy of this report is available on my Department's website, <i><i></i></i>. </p><p>  On 25 February 2014, the Government approved the establishment of a Homelessness Policy Implementation Team and an implementation unit.  The team is tasked with implementing the Homelessness Oversight Group's First Report.  This will include the preparation and publication of a structured, practical plan to make the transition from a shelter-led to a sustainable housing-led response to homelessness and to achieve the 2016 goals for homelessness.  This plan will be a practically focused delivery plan to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. It will contain actions that will be direct, immediate and solutions based. </p><p>  The implementation team is representative of the key State agencies dealing with homelessness, housing and related services because the solutions to homelessness do not solely reside in my Department.  The team is being led by my Department and it includes a senior official from the Department of Social Protection and the Health Service Executive as well as the Managers of Dublin City Council and Monaghan County Council, representing local authorities.  The team will report on this plan to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy in April 2014 and quarterly thereafter.   </p><p>  I am acutely aware of the significant number of families now presenting as homeless in the Dublin region and the extremely challenging situation that this is presenting to Dublin City Council.  My Department is working with Dublin City Council on measures to address this emerging situation and the plan will incorporate actions to address this and other accommodation related issues.   </p></reply>

However, contrary to certain misunderstanding that may exist following the recent establishment of Irish Water, there is no specific legal impediment to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure by local authorities at present.  As also indicated in this circular letter, pending further legislation and guidelines in 2014, planning authorities have been advised that they should in the first instance consult with Irish Water on any proposal to take in charge water services infrastructure which would ultimately be transferred to Irish Water under section 12 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.</p></reply>

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:- enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service; enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be 	permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years; enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p><p>  It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association within the next few weeks.</p></reply>

In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme.</p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form.</p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.</p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. </p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220 million.</p></reply>

Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.</p><p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database. This has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included. In certain circumstances these adjustments are giving rise to penalties.</p><p>  The LPIS Review process initiated by my Department consisted on a review of all of the eligible land parcels in the LPIS database, which was declared by farmers under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes. In total, the Review covered in excess of 132,000 applicants and the land parcels declared by them as eligible for payment under one of more of the above-mentioned Schemes.  A comprehensive review and appeals process has been implemented to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised. In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials. If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the <i>Independent LPIS Appeals Committee</i>  , chaired by Mr. P&aacute;draig Gibbons. To date, 90 cases have been forwarded to the Agriculture Appeals Committee on receipt of appeals from the applicants concerned. The committee has not as yet adjudicated on these appeals.</p><p>  It is important to note that there are some positive outcomes of the current Review from a farmer&rsquo;s point of view. In the first instance, I announced recently that the number of payment entitlements, which farmers will be granted under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 will be based on the 2013 eligible land or in 2015 if it is lower. This means that farmers, who have ineligible land deducted in 2013 as part of this Review, will be protected under the new Regime as their entitlements will be based on the actual eligible land in 2013. In addition, it also means that farmers, who are contributing to the convergence process by having reductions applied to their entitlements, will not see part of the funds used to make payments on ineligible lands.</p><p>  A deliberate decision was taken late last year not to delay payments to those farmers whose payments were due to be subject to reduction following the outcome of the Review; rather, the payments issued with the sums in question deducted, the farmers concerned being then advised of the reductions and the appeals process. This course of action was specifically designed to ensure that there was no undue delay in issuing payments, while also ensuring that farmers were aware of the appeals process.</p></reply>

Over 10,000 grant applications were received from farmers under the various TAMS prior to the relevant closing date for each scheme. All eligible applications which were received by my Department by the closing dates concerned either have already received or will receive an approval to proceed with the investment works concerned.</p><p>  Over &euro;31 million has been paid out under the TAMS, to date, and I would expect that significant further expenditure will take place under the schemes as farmers complete the investment works for which they have received an approval.  A breakdown of the expenditure, to date, under each TAMS measure on a county-by-county basis will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p><p>  The consultation paper prepared by my Department in relation to the proposed measures for inclusion in Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme for 2014-2020 includes a commitment to the introduction of further targeted investment schemes for the agricultural sector (TAMS II).  I would hope to be able to include further details in relation to these measures in the Rural Development Programme itself when it is finalised in the near future.</p></reply>

With regard to the welfare of animals, the Act puts clear obligations on owners regarding the need to look after animals under their care. These relate to feed and drink, shelter and protection from disease, injury, or discomfort. Significant powers are provided to authorised officers to inspect any premises where animals of any species are present. Where offences occur, the Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Act 2013 provides for increased penalties, with fines of up to &euro;5,000 on summary conviction and &euro;250,0000 and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years on indictment. It also provides for fixed penalty payments for lesser offenses.</p><p>  In addition, for the first time the new Animal Health and Welfare Act provides the legal basis to enable the Department require notification of transfer of ownership of horses. Legislation is being prepared to provide for this and will be ready shortly. Regulations on the registration of horse premises, which were introduced in 2012, require an owner/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept to register the premises with the Department. These regulations are also continued under the new Animal Health and Welfare Act. To date, my Department has 12,000 registered horse premises in its database under the relevant statutory instrument.</p><p>  My Department continues to work closely with the local authorities, the Gardai Siochana and animal welfare bodies with a view to addressing horse welfare issues generally and where necessary, removing abandoned horses from public lands. In some instances local authorities have assisted with the removal of horses trespassing (without the consent of the farmer) on a farmer&rsquo;s private lands. Additional funding resources of &euro;3.1m was provided to the local authorities in 2013 to enable them to deal with stray and unwanted horses and this enabled the removal last year of in excess of 4,700 stray or unwanted horses throughout the country. </p><p>  With regard to horses in the non-thoroughbred horse sector, my Department continues to adopt a pro-active approach in relation to production, husbandry, treatment and general welfare issues. The Department has been working with the Farm Animal Advisory Council (FAWAC) on the these issues and a very informative booklet has been produced by FAWAC on animal welfare guidelines for horses, ponies and donkeys in an effort to promote sound welfare and management practices. In essence, the booklet advises horse owners that they should ensure that horses in their care have, as a minimum, access to proper shelter, a dry lie area to protect against inclement weather and access to good quality pasture and fodder.</p><p>  In recognition of the assistance provided by animal welfare bodies in protecting horse welfare, I awarded funding of &euro;1.8m in December 2013 to organisations involved in animal care and welfare services throughout the country to support their activities in 2014. Funding was increased and concentrated on those animal welfare organisations involved with horses. </p></reply>

Under Regulation 1249/2008, DG AGRI of the European Commission receives beef carcase prices from all Member States, including Ireland on a weekly basis.  The European Commission chairs a Management Committee on Animal Products and the trends and variations in cattle prices are outlined on a monthly basis.  </p><p>  The information supplied at the management meeting includes details of prices paid in each EU Member State as well as information on the level of imports into and exports from the European Union, for all meat products (beef, pigs, poultry, and sheep) on an ongoing basis.  Officials of my Department attend these management committee meetings.  In addition, Bord Bia issues a weekly commentary on cattle prices and supply and demand trends in our main export markets including the United Kingdom.</p><p>  While my Department has a role in monitoring and reporting on cattle prices I have no function in relation to commercial transactions between meat factories and their suppliers.  However, as the Irish beef industry is highly export dependent the need to ensure that it is producing efficiently for overseas markets cannot be ignored.  The relationship between processors and farmers is an interdependent one.  Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either beef finishers or suckler farmers. </p><p>  The current situation clearly underlines the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain and to address supply chain issues in such a context.  An industry-led solution to the current uncertainty is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.</p></reply>

The free movement of goods and services within the Single Market means that Irish enterprises now have access to export markets which previously were not an option because of the costs involved and additional cross-border bureaucracy.</p><p>  All Irish beef producers have ready, unimpeded and equal access to all EU Member State markets without restriction.  Articles 34 to 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union prohibit Member States from maintaining or imposing barriers on intra-EU trade in goods. These provisions give rise to the principle of mutual recognition whereby each Member State is obliged to accept onto its market products which are legally manufactured or marketed in another Member State. Member States can only refuse to apply this principle in cases where there is an overriding public interest (e.g. public safety, public or animal health or the protection of the environment). Even then, all trade restrictive measures taken must be necessary for, and proportionate to, the protection of the public interest concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware there are no official controls in the European Union for beef prices. Cattle and beef prices are determined by the dynamics of supply and demand in the marketplace and neither I nor any agriculture Minister in the European Union have any function in that regard. That is a commercial matter between beef producers, beef processors and retailers. Furthermore, successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy have involved a shift to more market oriented policies that move away from price supports and towards direct payments to farmers.</p></reply>

In that respect we have substantial offensive interests in the agreements being negotiated with the United States and also with Japan, Thailand and Vietnam.  Of course we have defensive interests too &ndash; related primarily to our beef sector.  Our strategy is to push hard for agreements that balance these offensive interests with our defensive ones.  These principles apply equally across the EU and within the EU Commission, which negotiates on behalf of Member States.</p><p>  On TTIP Ireland is pressing hard to secure substantial access for our dairy products to the US and to eliminate the technical barriers that hinder that trade.  We are also pushing for better access for our pork, cereals and beverages sectors.</p><p>  On beef, we will continue to argue, as we have been doing, that any beef quotas awarded to the US must be limited in size and must take into account the segmentation of the EU market between high value cuts and other beef.  </p><p>  As to the WTO, at the Ministerial Conference in Bali last December, Ministers mandated the negotiating committee to prepare a clearly defined work program on the remaining Doha Development Agenda issues. Although expectations are not high, the EU may come under pressure to agree a further mini-package that could include more far-reaching commitments on export subsidies.  My view is that we should seek a comprehensive, balanced and ambitious outcome across all elements of DDA negotiations.  We are, of course, prepared to engage actively in the post Bali work programme. </p></reply>

These import requirements are generic and applicable for all countries authorised to export to the EU. The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between Member States. </p><p>  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>  Products must have originated in an area where there are no restrictions imposed under EU Safeguard measures and come from establishments which are under the supervision and control of the competent authorities. The products must be free from residues and contaminants, correctly labelled and travel with the specific health certificates or other documents conforming to the models laid down in EU legislation drawn up in conformity with the relevant model for the product, completed and signed on behalf of the competent authorities of the country of export. The EU's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out assessments of third countries wishing to export these products to the EU and submits for Commission approval those where the responsible authorities can provide appropriate guarantees as regards compliance or equivalence with Community feed and food law and animal health rules. Third countries and their establishments that are approved to export are audited and inspected by the FVO with regard to these guarantees and reports of the findings of inspections are published on its website.</p><p>  Import controls on products of animal origin arriving from third countries must be performed at an EU Border Inspection Post approved for that category of product being presented.  Consignments for import requiring veterinary checks must be notified in advance to the Border Inspection Post of import and presented on arrival for checks with all the appropriate documentation.  Border Inspection Posts in Ireland are operated by my Department. The import controls procedures on products of animal origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance. Again, reports of the findings of inspections are published on the FVO's website. In order to import fish or fishery products into Ireland from a non EU country or non European Economic Area Country  the general position is that the person who wishes to import fish/fishery products is required to register with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). Application forms can be obtained from SFPA. Following registration the importer is assigned a unique registration number and all details are kept on the SFPA register of importers of fish/fishery products<i>. </i></p><p>  In summary, the import of products from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by EU Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office, to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.</p></reply>

It should be appreciated, however, that many applicants, who declare land situated in a Disadvantaged Area are not eligible for payment under the Scheme either because they do not maintain any animals or those that do maintain animals do not keep sufficient livestock to meet the minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare.  This is a normal feature of the Disadvantaged Area Scheme. </p><p>  Successive EU audits have made it clear that payments should not issue under Area Based schemes, including Single Farm and Disadvantaged Areas, until all queries associated with an application are resolved</p><p>  Grassland Sheep Scheme</p><p>  Payments commenced on 10 December 2013 and to date payments in excess of 12.5 million have issued to over 29,000 farmers. </p><p>  Agri &ndash; Environment Schemes</p><p>  Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS)</p><p>  In relation to 2013 a total of 26,821 applicants have now received a total of &euro;152.33m under their REPS 4 contracts.

I strongly believe that the new CFP will achieve that goal.</p><p>  The new CFP, negotiated to completion under the Irish Presidency, will mean real meaningful reform to how EU waters are fished in the future. The agreement is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters, utilising best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas in the future.</p><p>  The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) will provide the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry. The package agreed will support the rebuilding of fish stocks in European waters and will allow for setting TACs and quotas to reflect catches when a landing obligation is introduced on the basis that for the first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock will no longer be allowed. In the longer term as fish stocks reach and are maintained at healthy levels, it will support increased fishing opportunities for our fishermen.</p><p>  New opportunities for the direct involvement of the fishing industry are also a central part of the new CFP Reform which, for the first time, introduces a regionalised approach to fisheries management.  We have moved away from the old system of an EU decision making approach centralised in Brussels. The new policy puts fishermen at the core of developing conservation measures for fisheries in which they are involved and also makes specific references to taking account of the needs of our fishermen. </p><p>  A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of the MSY Principle (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for Irish fishermen and more sustainable fishing patterns.</p><p>  The reform also contains a commitment to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in the biologically sensitive areas, including that off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box). This commitment will also protect the livelihoods of coastal communities by ensuring that fish are allowed to grow to maturity, are more plentiful and fished in an environmentally responsible manner. A new framework of Technical measures will also be introduced to avoid and minimise catches of juvenile fish.</p><p>  Details on fish stocks in Irish waters are monitored by the Marine Institute (MI) and published annually in their 'MI Stock Book' which is prepared by the Institute's Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS) and presented to my Department in October each year. The publication also contains important up to date scientific advice on the state of fisheries resources which informs fishing opportunities for the following year. The Stock Book contains impartial scientific advice developed by the Marine Institute working with other international scientists and is developed using the latest available research, assessments and advice on the fisheries resource. </p><p>  The seas around Ireland (ICES Sub Areas VII and VI) are among the most productive and biologically sensitive areas in EU waters. Most of the fisheries resource within the area comes under the remit of the EUs Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In June 2013, the European Commission reported that fish stocks in European waters are improving (EC COM(2013) 319 final). The proportion of overfished stocks in the Atlantic declined from around 90% of all stocks between 2005-2009 to 39% in 2013. Some stocks in the west of Scotland, Irish Sea and Celtic sea have suffered from being over fished in the past and remain vulnerable (i.e. Cod in Divisions VIa and VIIa, Sole in Division VIIa, Whiting in Divisions VIa and VIIa).  </p><p>  This morning I also launched the <i>Atlas of Commercial Fisheries around Ireland</i> published by the Marine Institute. This shows the distribution of fishing activities in Irish waters by gear and country. Fishing grounds as well as the distribution of landings for all the main commercial species are also shown at high resolution. The Atlas presents complex data in a very visual way using informative maps, making it accessible to a whole range of stakeholders. It brings a new level of transparency in terms of fishing activities and offers new possibilities in terms of spatial management of mixed fisheries. Both the Stock Book and the Atlas are available to download on the Marine Institute's web site at . The information provided helps to form the policy and positions adopted when negotiating annual fishing opportunities each December.</p><p>  A new funding support mechanism, the European Fisheries and Maritime Fund is being finalised at EU level which  will support the fishing industry adapt to the new CFP and support development of the seafood industry.   A programme for the development of the seafood industry in Ireland is being prepared and will be developed in full consultation with stakeholders.</p></reply>

More than 85% of Irish dairy production is exported and Ireland has access for dairy products to over eighty countries worldwide.  Nevertheless I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa and elsewhere.  I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  </p><p>  The ending of the milk quota regime represents an exceptional opportunity to increase milk output, both in Ireland and in other Member States where milk production forms a significant part of their agricultural output.  A Report published by the EU Commission last December on how markets are evolving, as the ending of milk quotas approaches, found that medium and long term prospects for the dairy sector are favourable.  This conclusion is based on population growth projections and westernisation of diets in emerging economies.  The Report did caution, however, that this outlook did not rule out short term market fluctuations.</p><p>  Ireland strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1 April 2015 on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  I expect the abolition of quotas to facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020.  For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment and equip it to respond to the market opportunities arising.</p><p>  A key element of this market strategy is to optimise the already positive green image of Ireland in order to create a point of differentiation for Irish dairy products on international markets.  In this context, I launched a National Sustainability and Quality Scheme for the dairy sector, which will build on the already formidable reputation of the Irish dairy sector in international markets, by capitalising on Ireland's reputation for green, carbon efficient, high quality dairy production.  At processing level, Bord Bia's Origin Green Programme is providing a vehicle for industry to commit itself to sustainability targets by reducing energy inputs, minimising overall carbon footprint and mitigating the impact on the environment.  This pro-active approach to environmental sustainability has a strong resonance with procurement strategists in the many multinational food companies who are interested in using Ireland as a source of high quality food ingredients and processed products. </p><p>  Of course the industry itself has a responsibility to focus its efforts on market and product development.  Supported by Government, the Irish dairy sector has succeeded in positioning itself as a major international player, and we have seen industry announcements in relation to the development of supply arrangements between Irish companies and multinational players in third countries, and the development of value added products which can maximise the value of our dairy output. </p><p>  At farm level my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has been working with, and will continue to work towards helping the industry prepare for this move to a quota free environment. A range of supports have been provided to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to reduce costs and improve efficiency at farm level.  Such supports include the Dairy Efficiency Programme, which has facilitated a significant increase in Discussion Group participation, and the Dairy Equipment Scheme, which provides grant aid for milking machines, cooling equipment and other related ancillary equipment.</p><p>  Taking all this into account, I am confident that the collaborative efforts of Government, the processing industry and the producers will ensure a thriving and sustainable dairy sector that can use the opportunity afforded by the abolition of quotas to fully leverage the natural advantage of Ireland's grass-based production system.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-26a.469.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032600103#WRCC00500"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I received Government approval on 19<sup>th</sup> November 2013 to proceed with drafting the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013.  Standardised packaging, also known as generic packaging, means that all forms of branding &ndash; trademarks, logos, colours and graphics &ndash; would be removed, except for the brand and variant names, which would be presented in a uniform typeface for all brands on the market.  All packs would be in a plain neutral colour, except for the mandatory health warnings and the tax stamp.  The objective is to make all tobacco packs look less attractive to consumers and to make health warnings more prominent. </p><p>  In December 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging of tobacco products.  Given that it is such a recent innovation, it has not been possible at this early stage to conduct research that would fully evaluate the impact of this policy in practice.  However, a limited amount of research is beginning to be published.  One study, published in December 2013, concluded that smoking in outdoor areas declined by 23%, and personal pack display (where packs are clearly visible on tables) declined by 15% following the introduction of plain packaging and larger pictorial warnings on packs.  Another Australian study found a 78% increase in the number of calls to the smoking cessation helpline, Quitline, associated with the introduction of plain packaging. </p><p>  It is important to state that the introduction of standardised packaging forms the latest strand of a comprehensive range of tobacco control legislation already in place in Ireland aimed at decreasing tobacco consumption in this country.  Ireland&rsquo;s new policy document in this area,<b></b><b><i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i></b>, launched on 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2013, sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (i.e. with a prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025. <b><i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i></b>  addresses a range of tobacco control issues and initiatives and contains over 60 recommendations, one of which is the introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco products. </p><p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s query about costs; there would be no specific cost to the Exchequer related to the introduction of this measure per se.  However, since the intent of the measures outlined in Tobacco Free Ireland is to reduce tobacco use, it could, in the absence of future increases in Excise rates, lead to a reduction in Excise receipts from tobacco which in 2012 yielded &euro;1.072 billion.  Any impact on Excise receipts needs to be set against the economic costs of deaths and illness attributable to smoking.  European research on the issue indicated that a very conservative estimate of this for 2009 is in the region of &euro;664 million.  This is composed of &euro;498 million in health expenditure on smoking related areas, &euro;15 million in productivity losses due to absenteeism and &euro;151 million in productivity losses due to long term incapacity.</p></reply>

It aims to address the opportunities and challenges associated with ageing at both an individual and societal level and across the full range of policy areas in a well-thought out, coherent and inclusive way. It notes that in light of realistic resource expectations, all Government Departments and agencies, local Government and institutions should review the effectiveness of existing policies, services and supports with a view to identifying whether inefficiencies in provision exist and how they can be addressed.  They must refocus and adapt existing services rather than establish new ones.  Maximising value for money and cost effectiveness in the funding and operation of services for a more-coordinated and effective use of the resources currently invested is the priority.</p><p>  The Government is pursuing an ambitious programme of reform for our health sector, including in social care and care for older people.  We want a health service that is patient-centred, whether that patient is young or old.  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme continues to be an extremely generous support for those who need long-term residential care.  The budget for the Scheme in 2014 is &euro;939m and the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2014 sets a target of 22,061 people to be in receipt of financial support towards the cost of long-term nursing home care in December 2014.  An Implementation Plan for the Positive Ageing Strategy is currently being prepared.</p><p>  While there will of course always be a need for long-term residential care, older people have consistently said that they want to be facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as it is viable for them to do so, and it is Government policy to develop this approach.  Accordingly in 2014 there is an enhanced focus on home and community supports.  Provision for community and home-based services are being strengthened by &euro;23m to allow more people to stay in their own homes for longer.  This is in addition to the budget of &euro;315m provided for home help and home care package services which are delivered to some 56,000 people at any one time.</p></reply>

In 2012 the HSE completed a prioritisation exercise for all primary care centre locations.  In addition to the locations' ranks as a result of the prioritisation exercise, the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors including GP participation.  GP commitment to sharing accommodation with HSE staff and delivering health care services from these facilities is important for primary care centre delivery.</p><p>  The primary care infrastructure model offers a good fit for public private financing.  Significant progress has been achieved using the operational lease mechanism and the HSE continues to work with the private sector to deliver primary care centres by this means.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care centres are also subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available and to successful planning processes.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic exercise, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.</p><p>  As with all capital projects the primary care infrastructure programme including this location must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.  There is limited funding available for new projects over the period 2014-2018 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.</p><p>  Your question in relation to whether contracts have been signed for the purchase or construction of any building and the name of the other party or parties to the contract has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p></reply>

However, while the situation is avoided where possible, all hospitals must optimise the availability and occupancy of all bed spaces.  As a result, there are extenuating circumstances where mixed wards can occur in Emergency Departments, Acute Medical Assessment Units, Intensive Care Units and Coronary Care Units.  In these situations best practices are in place to protect the privacy and dignity of patients.  The ongoing improvements in ward accommodation and increase in single room accommodation aims to provide appropriate accommodation for all patients.</p><p>  The HSE  intends that all newly built acute hospital in-patient accommodation at new hospital builds, major additions to existing hospitals or major renovations to existing hospital in-patient accommodation areas should be made up entirely of single patient rooms and that all newly built non-acute hospital in-patient accommodation, when included within an acute hospital setting, should be made up of a minimum of 50% single patient rooms.</p><p>  In relation to the particular queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to her directly.</p></reply>

This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising the Health Act 2007, Regulations and the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.</p><p>  All designated centres, public, voluntary and private nursing homes are subject to the same core standards and regulations in relation to quality and safety in order to ensure the well-being of their residents. In accordance with the legislation, all designated centres are required to have a comprehensive policy in place for dealing with complaints made by or on behalf of residents.</p><p>Government for National Recovery, 2011-2016 commits to developing and implementing national standards for home support services, which will be subject to HIQA inspection. Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services. This is being considered in the wider context of the licensing of Public and Private Health Service Providers.</p><p>I would like to emphasise, however that statutory regulation or licensing is only one way of improving quality and safety and the HSE is already progressing a range of measures to improve Home Care provision overall, to standardise services nationally and to promote quality, and safety. These include a Procurement Framework for Home Care Services with quality and screening requirements which came into effect in 2012 and applies to services procured by the HSE from external providers.</p><p>  The HSE is currently undertaking a review of home care services with a view to improving services generally.</p></reply>

It currently funds counselling and other support services to women who have received a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormalities and their families.</p><p>  The HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme (the Programme) defines crisis pregnancy as &ldquo;a pregnancy which is neither planned nor desired by the woman concerned and which represents a personal crisis for her&rdquo;. The Programme understands this definition to include the experiences of those women for whom a planned or desired pregnancy develops into a crisis over time due to a change in circumstances.</p><p>  The primary function of the Programme is to prepare and implement a strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy, in consultation with relevant Departments of State and with such other persons as are considered appropriate. The purpose of the Programme is to bring strategic focus to the issue of crisis pregnancy and so to add further value to the work of existing service providers. The Programme is currently delivering a programme of work to meet the strategic objectives of its third national strategy for the period 2012 &ndash; 2016.</p><p>  The Programme funds 15 Service Providers, both non-statutory and statutory, to provide free, non-judgmental crisis pregnancy counselling and related services in over 50 centres nationwide. These services are governed by a mix of Service Arrangements, Grant Aid Agreements and Service Level Agreements, depending on the funding thresholds concerned. The agreements sit under Section 39 grant funding governance framework (HSE Governance Framework for the Funding of Non-Statutory Services) and HSE governance processes (SLAs).</p><p>  The mix of services include those who provide counselling on all options and contact details for abortion service providers abroad if requested in a face to face counselling session (3-option information services) and those who provide counselling and information on all options but do not provide contact details for abortion service provider&rsquo;s abroad if requested (2-option information services). </p><p>  The Programme funds the Crisis Pregnancy Counselling Certificate Course in NUI Maynooth. This course and the practice guide that accompanies it address the issue of a diagnosis of a foetal abnormality. Crisis pregnancy counsellors provide support to women and their partners in dealing with a diagnosis of foetal abnormality. As with all crisis pregnancy counselling the woman and her partner are supported through the decision they make. </p><p>  The Programme also funds services to provide free post-abortion medical check-ups and post-abortion counselling for women living in Ireland who have had an abortion. The counsellors and doctors working in these services are experienced in supporting women who have had an abortion. They see women who have had an abortion recently and women who had an abortion many years ago. </p><p>  All services offer crisis pregnancy counselling from one to multiple sessions depending on what the client seeks. These services operate a mix of models that in some cases facilitate their ongoing engagement with clients who opt to parent and need support with this or who are considering adoption and require further counselling in this area.</p><p>  For further information on services funded by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme, please see: ; </p></reply>

These regulations allowed a five year derogation from that limit for vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to 1st November 2008. The derogation was introduced to allow a 5-year period within which vehicles operating at heights in excess of the new limits could be withdrawn from use or to allow the necessary height reductions by operators. This derogation expired on the 31st October last. </p><p>  Following the expiry of the derogation, specific concerns have been raised with me by the agri-sector in relation to the effect that the 4.65 metre maximum vehicle height restriction would have on the cost of transporting fodder. Unfortunately, these concerns were only raised by the sector immediately prior to the expiry of the 5 year derogation in October last, and not prior to the 2008 regulations being signed into law nor in the subsequent five years.</p><p>  Notwithstanding this, I have considered the various issues involved and consulted with my colleague Minister Simon Coveney, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and with Irish Rail and the IFA. Arising from this, my officials are drafting regulations to allow for a very narrow exemption for the haulage of agricultural fodder, i.e. straw and hay only, from the height limits brought in by the 2008 regulations.  Those regulations are nearing completion and I hope to be in a position to sign them shortly.</p></reply>

Since 2000, 58 projects have or are being dealt with under the Programme, of which 49 have been completed and the other 9 projects are at various stages of the Programme.  There are four stages in the development of a project under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, namely Preliminary Report, Contract Documents, Tender and Construction.     </p><p>  There is no criterion regarding a specific population requirement for the allocation of funding for the construction of a public swimming pool.  However,<i></i>the Feasibility Study prepared by the local authority as part of the Preliminary Report Stage is a key part of the overall process, focusing as it does, on central aspects of any pool project including the geographical location of the pool, its hinterland, the facilities to be provided and the consequent potential number of visitors or visits per annum needed to sustain business viability.  Of particular relevance in this regard is the size of the target population within a reasonable travelling distance of the pool, the demographics involved, and market surveys of likely participation in swimming activity for the purpose of calculating the potential numbers of visitors to the pool.  The effect of other swimming facilities in the area is also taken into account.</p></reply>

Use of these vehicles is restricted to the operational functions of the IRCG and AAIU and is not available to non-technical administrative staff in the Department.
