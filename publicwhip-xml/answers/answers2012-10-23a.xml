    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-23a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102300050#WRA01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 61, 64, 80, 91, 92 and 98 together.</p><p>  The questions tabled cover a range of issues related to the Action Programme for Effective Local Government: <i>Putting People First</i> which I published on 16 October 2012 following Government approval.  This is available on my Department&#8217;s website www.environ.ie.  The Action Programme sets out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government including structures, functions, funding, operational arrangements, governance and the role of the executive and the elected council.</p><p>  Strengthening the role of local government is at the core of the reform programme and Government policy in this regard is set out in the Action Programme with particular regard to three key areas, the o<font color="#2F2F2F">peration of the local micro-enterprise support service through Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs); local authority oversight and planning of local and community development programmes; and an enhanced and clearer role in economic development. These decisions represent the most significant enhancement of the role of local government in many decades.</font></p><p>  In addition, in the course of drawing up the reform programme, I requested Ministers to undertake an examination of functions and services in their areas of responsibility with a view to identifying further matters that could be devolved to local government. This process has identified a number of functions that are potentially suitable for devolution and initial proposals in this regard are detailed in the Action Programme. While the initial range of functions proposed for devolution by Departments is relatively limited, there will be further engagement with a view to identifying additional activities ahead of the development of legislation to implement reform measures. The scope to assign any additional functions to the new municipal district level will also be explored.</p><p>  The proposals in the Action Programme regarding delegation of authority to local authorities in the areas of environment, water, foreshore, local or community development, roads or traffic, housing and energy efficiency, involve giving greater responsibility or discretion to local authorities in relation to various areas in which they already have a significant involvement and where there is scope for reducing the degree of central control. The particular changes involved will vary between the different areas and will be determined specifically in the course of implementation of the Programme.</p><p>  The Action Programme also sets out a clear commitment that, <font color="#2F2F2F">in future, the functions of Government at local level will be performed through the local government system to the greatest possible extent and separate structures or organisations of public administration will not be established outside of the local government system unless, in exceptional circumstances, the need for this is clearly demonstrated.  The Action Programme indicates that the establishment of an office of directly elected mayor for Dublin, with substantial powers, functions and budgetary capacity, would be likely to require significant changes in existing local government arrangements. </font>The Government has decided, therefore, that <font color="#2F2F2F">a special forum or colloquium of the elected members of the Dublin local authorities should be convened to consider the options in this regard, including the introduction of a directly elected Mayor for a Dublin metropolitan area, which will be put for decision through a plebiscite in 2014. </font>  Terms of Reference for the forum will be published in due course.</p><p>  Outside of Dublin, a radical restructuring of local government arrangements within counties has been approved by Government. This will involve a comprehensive territorial configuration of each county into municipal districts in which the elected members will perform a range of important local functions on a fully devolved basis. The districts will be designed, as far as possible, around existing municipal towns and large urban centres which do not currently enjoy municipal status. In all cases, the district should incorporate the relevant hinterland of each town, subject to the constraints imposed by county boundaries close to towns. I have made clear that the integrity and identity of counties will be maintained. </p><p>  The Action Programme indicates that, in cases where the environs of a town are located in more than one county, suitable agency arrangements or service level agreements should be implemented to ensure that one authority has responsibility for all functions and services throughout the entire area of the town, notwithstanding county boundaries. It is, of course, also open to local authorities to initiate boundary alteration procedures under local government legislation, but there is no mandatory requirement in this regard under the reform programme.</p><p>  Regarding representational ratios, the areas of municipal districts will be drawn up for the purposes of the 2014 local elections, on the basis of a review by an independent statutory boundary committee under the local government acts. The Action Programme provides indicative information regarding the sort of factors that will be relevant to the configuration of districts, including population, membership, location of towns, geographic coherence and local identities and linkages. Relevant criteria will be specified in the terms of reference for the review which will be published shortly.  </p><p>  In relation to the reserved functions of elected members, a number of new reserved functions are specified in the Action Programme, for example, the adoption of economic development plans, service plans, and local and community plans. In addition, the scope for further extension of the reserved functions of elected members of local authorities will be fully reviewed in the context of further development and implementation of the reform programme. In particular, the potential role of the elected council in relation to additional functions being devolved to local government will be maximised. Moreover, the primacy of the elected council within the local government system will be reinforced by various measures set out in the programme.</p><p>  The relationship between manager and members will be changed to one of chief executive and &#8220;board of directors&#8221;, appropriate to a modern system of administration. Consideration will be given to providing stronger and more explicit statutory expression in relation to the duty of the manager/chief executive to comply with policy as set down by the elected council and <font color="#2F2F2F">to strengthen the capacity of the elected council to oversee the business, finances and performance of the authority</font>. The manner in which local authority functions are stated and structured in law, including the default provision which grants the manager power to act unless powers are specifically assigned to members, will also be addressed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-23a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102300050#WRA02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 75, 76, 89, 97 and 105 together. </p><p>  On 27 September 2012 a foreshore licence was granted to Providence Resources in respect of works to undertake site investigations and drilling of a single exploration well off the coast of Dalkey, Co Dublin. Information on the decision to grant the licence was published on my Department&#8217;s website on 3 October 2012. The information published includes the main reasons and considerations upon which the decision was based. I am satisfied that the arrangements made for participation by the public in the determination of the proposal, and the provision of information on access to justice, are fully in compliance with the requirements of the Aarhus Convention.</p><p>  The Aarhus Convention was ratified by the State in June 2012 and entered into force on 18 September 2012. The three pillars of the Convention are access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice. Over 60 pieces of legislation have been used to implement the Aarhus Convention, including a number of amendments to the Foreshore Acts. I am therefore satisfied that the requirements of the Aarhus Convention have been fully complied with in terms of access to information and public participation. There was a significant number of submissions from the public as part of the public consultation process. With regard to the third pillar of the Convention, access to justice, information on how a review of the decision to grant the licence may be sought, is available on my Department&#8217; s website .</p><p>  In addition to information on the decision in the case, a range of other materials on the application was published on my Department&#8217;s website during the application process, including the application materials submitted by the applicant, submissions received from the public and prescribed bodies, the applicant&#8217;s responses to those submissions, and the report of the Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC).</p><p>  With regard to the EU Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment, the proposal was not of a class that required the submission of an environmental impact statement by the applicant or the performance of an environmental impact assessment under the Directive. However, the applicant submitted an environmental report and the proposal was the subject of an environmental assessment by the scientific and technical advisors on the Marine Licence Vetting Committee. Their assessment involved a detailed examination of the application materials, issues raised in submissions received from the public and prescribed bodies, and the applicant&#8217;s responses to those issues. The assessment carried out by the MLVC involved a consideration of the potential impacts of the proposal on any European Sites or species that could be affected by the works, sensitive species, other legitimate users in the area, and navigation issues.</p><p>  In the event that there is an application in the future for commercial exploitation of the site, such an application would be the subject of further formal applications for consents from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Commission for Energy Regulation with respect to safety, the Environmental Protection Agency should an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licence be required, An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Planning Acts, and a full lease or licence under the Foreshore Acts, all of which will require both an Environmental Impact Statement and an Environmental Impact Assessment, including full public consultation, which may include a public inquiry.</p></reply>

I am currently finalising a review of the implementation of the social housing assessment regulations introduced in April 2011, the result of which I expect to publish as revised regulations and guidance in the coming weeks. I also intend to build on the Social Housing (Allocation) Regulations 2011 which came into force in May 2011. These regulations set out the conditions that housing authorities must take into account when making their allocation schemes. In my review of the policy, I expect to more closely align it with the new approach to the assessment of need and to put a greater emphasis on &lsquo;time on the list&rsquo; as a criterion for allocating local authority housing. I believe that the &lsquo;time on the list&rsquo; criterion will provide a much more transparent system for the operation of a waiting list than the current point based system operated by many authorities.  It is a matter for housing authorities to communicate with both applicants for social housing support and current tenants, and I would expect such communication and access to information to be provided using all reasonable means to facilitate an efficient and effective service.</p></reply>

Under the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, a qualified household entered on the waiting list of one housing authority on the basis of residency or local connection may be entered simultaneously on the waiting list of up to 2 other authorities in the same county . However, it is not possible for a household to apply to more than one housing authority for social housing support, or for a household on the waiting list of one housing authority to transfer its application to another authority and to carry forward to the new waiting list the time spent on the previous list. I have no proposals to change the position in this regard.  As part of the programme of local government reform announced last week , I will examine the reserved functions of housing authorities to identify those appropriate for discharge at the new municipal district level and also the scope for greater discretion or responsibility at local level in relation to housing functions generally.</p></reply>

I am also advised by the statutory National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee in relation to Traveller accommodation matters more generally.</p><p>  Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing, which is financed from my Department&rsquo;s capital allocation for social housing, private housing assisted by the housing authority or voluntary organisations, private rented accommodation and through their own resources. Travellers are free to express a preference for any form of accommodation through the assessment of housing needs process. The March 2011 Housing Needs Assessment showed a very clear preference among Traveller families for standard housing.  Notwithstanding this, Traveller specific accommodation, such as halting sites and group housing schemes, continues to be provided by many local authorities where required.  My Department provides 100% capital funding for Traveller-specific accommodation and also provides funding for accommodation-related supports to operate in tandem with the capital programme. A total of &euro;10 million was allocated for this purpose in 2012. While the position regarding capital funding for my Department&rsquo;s housing programme in 2013 has yet to be decided, delivering on the housing needs of vulnerable groups such as Travellers will continue to be a priority.</p><p>  The Government remains committed to meeting the accommodation needs of Travellers. Since 2005, over &euro;187 million has been expended for the provision of new, and refurbishment of existing, Traveller-specific accommodation. This is in addition to expenditure on standard local authority housing and other housing supports. The results of this substantial financial commitment are reflected in the significant reduction in the numbers of Traveller families on unauthorised sites, down from over 1,200 families in 2000 to 327 families in 2011.  This was achieved at a time when the overall number of Traveller families increased from 4,790 to 9,535 over the same period.</p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &#8364;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &#8364;333.7m this year, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of our challenging circumstances, a tentative projection of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units is anticipated for 2012.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. These will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. The Housing Finance Agency has received seventeen applications for Certified Borrower status and awarded this status to five bodies. The Agency has approved four applications for 98 social housing units in total (at a valuation of &#8364;13.4 million). It is envisaged that further lending will be generated for the Agency in 2012 under this Scheme.</p><p>  The move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for AHBs and will take some time to be fully refined and deployed.  I intend to develop a regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it. To this end, on 8 August 2012 a draft voluntary code for the regulation of approved housing bodies was published on my Department&#8217;s website   for public consultation. This code will be a first step towards a statutory regulatory framework that will protect the very significant State investment in the sector over the last two decades and will provide assistance to those working in the sector to meet the challenges ahead. </p><p>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&#8217;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are working closely with NAMA with the aim of ensuring that a significant number of housing units are made available in this way by NAMA in the current year.  It is open to any person or household to apply to a housing authority for an assessment of their housing need. It is a matter solely for the housing authority concerned to determine whether an applicant for social housing support is eligible for and in need of that support. The authority must make its determination in accordance with the provisions of section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and regulations made under that section, primarily the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.</p></reply>

The 2012 Act, <i>inter alia</i>, amends Part 6 of the Principal Act, which relates to disbursement of monies from the Dormant Accounts Fund. Section 42 provides for<b></b>the following: <blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Making by the Minister of a disbursement scheme no later than 12 months after the &#8220;appointed day&#8221; relating to programmes or projects for which moneys may be disbursed. The &#8220;appointed day&#8221; has been set at 31 December 2012.   <br /><br />The scheme (or any subsequent amendment to it) must be prepared by the Minister having consulted with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Social Protection. The Minister may also consult with other Ministers or persons.   <br /><br />The Minister must have regard to the policies and priorities of Government, the amount of moneys available or likely to be available, and the need to ensure value for money in setting out a scheme.   <br /><br />The scheme must apply for a maximum period of 3 years, set out the objectives to be achieved by making disbursements and contain any other information considered appropriate by the Minister.   <br /><br />The Minister may, from time to time, but must within three years of making a scheme and every three years thereafter, review a scheme or any part of a scheme.   <br /><br />A scheme or an amendment to a scheme must be approved by Government.   <br /><br />A scheme, including an amendment to a scheme, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the Oireachtas allowed 21 days to consider it. </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>  The legislation also provides for the preparations of an action plan each year following the making of a scheme. The plan, which will also be subject to consultation, must indicate the programmes or types of projects that may apply for disbursement and the maximum funds available. Different amounts may be specified by the Minister in the plan in relation to a particular class or classes of programme or project. Once the plan is adopted, a copy must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, where it may be considered within a 21 day period. The plan must also be published. Provision is made, in addition, for adopting or not adopting a plan and for not proceeding to invite applications under a plan, if appropriate in particular circumstances. Any decision not to proceed must be approved by Government. </p></reply>

While I have received the responses, they do not provide any definitive proposals that would lead to a voluntary solution for homeowners. I have now asked my Department to finalise arrangements and terms of reference for the establishment of the Resolution Board as envisaged in the pyrite report as quickly as possible and to engage with the relevant stakeholders in finalising these details. This will give a final opportunity for all those directly or indirectly involved to play a key role in the remediation programme and to contribute to the cost of its resolution.

The Government also decided that the question of whether the role of Irish Water should be assigned to an existing State Agency merited further analysis with a view to ensuring that existing resources and capabilities in the State sector were used to best effect. </p><p>  This further analysis was undertaken by a team comprising my Department and NewERA, in consultation with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The process involved an assessment of the capacity and capabilities of a number of State agencies from amongst those identified in the independent assessment as having the potential to incorporate a new water utility. The process involved the making of detailed submissions and presentations by Bord na M&oacute;na and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann based on identified capabilities required for the establishment and operation of Irish Water.</p><p>  The outcome of the analysis was that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord G&aacute;is Group. Bord G&aacute;is has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, including experience in operating as a utility in a regulated environment and a track record in raising finance, and has specific skills from its own experience of transformation, customer relations, network management, metering and utility operation that can be quickly deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water. The skills within the Bord G&aacute;is Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.</p></reply>

My Department and individual local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that the borrower may be reasonably expected to sustain the loan over the full term. Of equal importance, in view of recent developments in the domestic property market, is the imperative for a local authority to ensure that prudence and pragmatism are applied to all aspects of the management of its housing loans book. In a time of limited resources deploying those resources in a focused and effective manner ensures the management of its loans portfolio can be achieved as efficiently as possible.</p><p>  The current credit policy has been in place since 2009. It was deemed appropriate at that time to update the elements associated with local authority lending and to have a homogenous regime in place that ensured best practice was followed across the sector. All applicants are now assessed according to the same criteria, and their applications subjected to the same independent scrutiny. It is desirable to make adequate lending provision available to local authority tenants who wish to avail of the tenant purchase schemes, while also adhering to prudent lending practices, and the current guidelines achieve equitable consideration of all applications.  While the rate of refusal of applications has increased it is also clear that the loans issued since the introduction of the revised credit policy are more likely to be fully performing. I am happy that the current mortgage loan model is fair, adequately meets the needs of prospective borrowers and facilitates participation in housing acquisition initiatives such as the tenant purchase schemes.</p></reply>

There are essentially three inter-related components to the reform programme and to date decisions have been taken by Government to:   <blockquote>- establish Irish Water as an independent state owned company within the Bord G&aacute;is Group based on a public utility model;   <br /><br />- introduce a sustainable funding model to support much needed investment in the sector, which will include the introduction of water charges for domestic users, and <br /><br />- establish an independent economic regulator for water services, a function being assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation.   </blockquote>  These inter-related reforms will provide the platform to significantly improve the quality of service, increase the cost efficiency associated with water services provision and accelerate investment in the sector. Intensive work on the development of an implementation strategy for the establishment of Irish Water is nearing a completion.  The strategy will focus on maintaining the delivery of a critical public service during and following the restructuring process.

Within this framework, the priority will be to ensure that the funding available is used to achieve the maximum progress possible across the range of programmes for which my Department is responsible, including housing, water services, community development, environmental protection and local government services. </p></reply>

Each housing authority also has a statutory duty to adopt an anti-social behaviour strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock, which must provide for co-operation with other relevant bodies, notably the Garda&iacute;, who have a range of measures in place to deal with allegations of racist behaviour generally.</p><p>  The new housing legislation currently being developed in my Department will introduce a revised procedure to replace section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, thus enabling housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households engaged in anti-social behaviour.

This document explores a number of options for the redevelopment of the area. My Department is currently liaising with the Council to further develop these proposals for incorporation into an overall Masterplan. As soon as this process has been concluded it is expected that the City Council will be in a position to provide projected multi-annual funding requirements for the future regeneration of Dolphin House.

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.</p><p>  The Government remains committed to meeting the accommodation needs of Travellers. Since 2005, over &euro;187 million has been expended for the provision of new, and refurbishment of existing, Traveller-specific accommodation. This is in addition to expenditure on standard local authority housing and other housing supports. The results of this substantial financial commitment are reflected in the significant reduction in the numbers of Traveller families on unauthorised sites, notwithstanding the continuing growth in the numbers of Traveller families nationally.</p><p>  In the context of declining housing capital allocations, priority consideration will be given to meeting the housing needs of vulnerable groups, including Travellers . While the results of the March 2011 Housing Needs Assessment showed a very clear preference among Travellers for standard housing, funding for Traveller-specific accommodation continues to be provided, with &euro;10 million being allocate for this purpose in 2012. The funding position for 2013 will be determined in the context of the overall budgetary provision for the social housing programme.</p><p>  My Department maintains regular contact with the local authorities in relation to the implementation of their Traveller accommodation programmes. I am also advised by the statutory National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC) in relation to Traveller accommodation matters more generally. The NTACC includes representatives of the Traveller organisations, local authority managers and my own Department. My Department recently completed meetings with each of the thirty four city and county councils to discuss their housing programme for this year and for 2013, including progress on implementing their Traveller accommodation programmes. I have no plans to convene a meeting , as proposed in the question, given the statutory role of the local authorities in planning and implementing agreed Traveller accommodation programmes locally and considering the existing consultation arrangements involving Traveller representatives, the local authorities and my Department.</p></reply>

The primary outcome from its implementation is the provision of a comprehensive, integrated and adequately resourced, world class outdoor recreation product. This will significantly enhance job creation and retention in the sector, support economic and community development in rural areas and boost GDP which benefits directly from expenditure by international tourists. It will also generate significant Exchequer savings through the improved health and well being of the population.</p><p>  My Department continues to implement the Walks Scheme which was launched in March 2008 on the recommendation of Comhairle na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council). It represented an innovative response to facilitating the development and maintenance of many of Ireland&rsquo;s key walking trails . The key point of the Scheme is that it brings in the landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on the trails in line with agreed work plans. The Walks Scheme is currently operating on 40 trails supported by 1,804 landowners, and is being managed by 16 Local Development Companies around the country. In addition, my Department is considering the development of a National Outdoor Recreation Plan for Public Lands and Waters in Ireland with the relevant State Agencies.</p><p>  My Department continues to be a main funding partner of Leave No Trace Ireland which promotes responsible recreational use in the outdoors. It encourages all outdoor enthusiasts to act responsibly in the outdoors and to do their part to protect those lands used by the public for the benefit of the environment and for future generations.</p><p>  My Department chairs regular meetings of Comhairle Na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) where matters are discussed relating to rural recreation/activity tourism and furthering the implementation of the priorities of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy (NCRS). Comhairle Na Tuaithe was established in February 2004 with a primary focus on the following priority areas; access to the countryside, developing a countryside code and developing a countryside recreation strategy. It comprises representatives of the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and state bodies with an interest in the countryside.</p><p>  A Pilot Mountain Access scheme is under development. It is intended to facilitate access to the uplands for hill walking and similar activities. A pi lot scheme has being developed at Mount Gable in Connemara and discussions are continuing regarding the expansion of the initial proposed Carrantuohill scheme to the entire MacGillicuddy Reeks in Co Kerry.</p></reply>

Where a treatment system is found to be polluting and an advisory notice requiring that the problem is rectified is issued by the water services authority, the remediation work to be carried out will depend on the specific problem identified, the extent of the risk to public health or the environment and issues such as site size and the hydrological and geological conditions present. The selection of a competent contractor to carry the remediation works necessary will be a matter for the householder concerned. There are no plans to establish a panel of contractors for remediation works.</p><p>  The Water Services Acts 2007 and 2012 (Domestic Wastewater Treatment Systems) Regulations 2012, which I made on 26 June, set out the requirements for the de-sludging of treatment systems. Subject to certain limited exceptions, de-sludging must be carried out using a contractor authorised under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007 as amended.

Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities.    The authorities are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary. In addition to prosecution on indictment in the Circuit Court, building control authorities may also bring summary prosecutions for building code offences in the District Court and have wide powers to make application to the High Court to secure Orders where buildings do not comply with the requirements of the Building Regulations.</p><p>  Failure to comply with the requirements of the Building Regulations where a successful prosecution takes place may result, on summary prosecution, in a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a period of up to six months or both. A further fine of &euro;500 in respect of each day on which the offence is committed after summary conviction can also be applied. A successful conviction on indictment may result in a maximum fine of &euro;50,000 or imprisonment for a period of up to two years or both.

At the end of September, &euro;33.3 million of this had been drawn down by local authorities, facilitating the payment of over 6,376 grants.  In assessing the demand for grants each year local authorities are requested to set out the amount of matching funding being provided to meet the authority&rsquo;s 20% share of the grant payments.

The first two annual progress reports under &#8220;Croke Park&#8221; from the Local Government Sector identified very significant savings of c&#8364;450m. Payroll savings have been delivered mainly through staff reductions of almost 8,600 (23%) from 37,243 (June 2008) to 28,652 (September 2012). </p><p>  The departure of 8,600 staff from the sector since 2008 has inevitably impacted in different ways upon individual local authorities. The staff reductions and the absence of any significant recruitment over a five year period makes it critical that we examine the present and future workforce demographic in the context of service delivery, organisational diversity, knowledge transfer, up-skilling/re-skilling and succession planning.  To support the sector in effectively managing the combination of staff reductions and the reform/change programme a Workforce Study has been undertaken jointly by local authorities and my Department. In particular, it assesses the management requirements of local authorities bearing in mind the potential impacts of shared services and other reform initiatives underway. Each local authority is in turn preparing a detailed workforce plan outlining how it will implement the Study&#8217;s recommendations.</p><p>  The Government has decided to introduce a targeted Voluntary Redundancy (VR) Scheme in parts of the Public Service. Details of how a scheme would operate in particular sectors are still being finalised within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. As outlined, in the Action Programme for Effective Local Government: <i>Putting People First</i>  , the potential to reach the optimum staffing structures indicated in the workforce plan as soon as possible through the use of voluntary exit mechanisms will be examined. </p></reply>

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, demonstrate that person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue.      As the applicant was born in Dublin on 7 May, 2009, his entitlement to Irish citizenship is subject to section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the Act).  This provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three of the four years immediately preceding that person&rsquo;s birth.</p><p>  In line with guidelines provided by Department of Justice and Equality, which is the Department responsible for immigration and citizenship, the proofs of lawful residence, which are accepted and considered by this Department for passport applications, are immigration stamps in passports and/or the registration cards/books. These are issued to persons registering their lawful presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). These are official documents/permits, which can be objectively verified by the Passport Service, if required. </p><p>  The child&rsquo;s father is a non-EU national and the mother a Romanian and therefore EU citizen.  The proofs above would therefore be required for all of the father&rsquo;s residence and for any of the mother&rsquo;s residence prior to Romania&rsquo;s entry into the EU on 1 January, 2007.  After this date, the mother&rsquo;s residence is subject to section 6B(2) of the Act, which makes particular provision for parents from EU Member States whereby such nationals may make a declaration (Form A) in a prescribed form concerning their residence in the island of Ireland within the four years immediately preceding the birth of their children.  This declaration must be supported by the submission of the parent&rsquo;s EU passport and by documentary evidence of that parent&rsquo;s lawful residence in Ireland.  That parent will then be regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of section 6A of the Act, unless the contrary is proved.</p><p>  Two applications were made on behalf of the person in question by his parents &ndash; the first in October, 2010 and the second in August, 2011.  On both occasions the submitted evidence of the parent&rsquo;s lawful residence in the State in the four year period immediately preceding their son&rsquo;s date of birth (i.e. 7 May, 2005 to 6 May, 2009) was examined.   Neither parent had the required amount of reckonable residence to demonstrate their child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.  Accordingly, these applications could not be approved for passport issue under the Passports Act, 2008 on the grounds that the child is not an Irish citizen.  </p></reply>

The relentless construction of settlements in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) is undermining the viability of a future Palestinian state. This is unambiguous EU policy, and a clear message that Ireland and our EU partners relay to the Israeli authorities in every meeting.  The settlement project is incompatible with a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and with the end of the occupation.<br /><br /><br />  Recognising that developments on the ground are threatening to make a two-state solution impossible, the Foreign Affairs Council in May adopted Conclusions that restated, and in many respects advanced, EU positions on issues such as the Palestinian depopulation of Area C and evictions and demolitions in East Jerusalem. Many of these issues are part and parcel of the settlement project. The Conclusions also set out the remedial action which we wish to see, primarily from Israel. Clearly the Council will have to continue to press on these issues, and I stressed this point again at the Foreign Affairs Council this week.<br /><br /><br />  While I do not support a boycott of Israel or goods produced in Israel, I do believe that the exclusion of goods produced by Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories would reflect the illegal status of such settlements under international law.  I have not yet made any formal proposal at EU level because I do not believe there is at present any prospect of getting EU agreement for such a ban. However, I already expressed the view that if there is no movement by Israel on the issues raised by the EU Council in relation to settlements, the Union should consider the exclusion of settlement products.<br /><br /><br />  As the Deputy knows, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade have written to me on this issue, and I will be replying in greater detail very shortly.</blockquote></p></reply>

During the peak season, the Passport Service receives between 300 and 400 applications per day for passports at short notice.  In these circumstances, it is not possible to provide citizens with a same day service without significantly disrupting the service to other applicants.   I have therefore asked the Passport Service to examine the feasibility and additional cost, to both the State and the customer, of providing a premium fast turnaround service.  In relation to the provision of alternate travel documents, some European countries have identity cards which are accepted by the immigration services of other countries.  Ireland does not issue identity cards to its citizens.  However, we do issue emergency passports and emergency travel certificates on occasion.  In order to minimise disruption of the regular service, the risk of identity theft and the circulation of falsified travel documents, such documents are generally only issued in cases of a necessity to travel for reasons of family emergency. i.e. travel is necessitated by the death, illness or welfare of a family member.</p><p>  With a view to avoiding future difficulties, I would urge all passport holders to use the online reminder service provided by the Passport Service which sends passport holders a reminder by e-mail three months before a passport is due to expire.

I appreciate that varying licensing requirements can pose difficulties for Irish people seeking to take up work in Australia.  In Australia, driving licences are issued by state and territory governments, and requirements can vary from state to state.  In some cases, recognition of driving licences also depends on the immigration status of the holder with different criteria applying for short-term temporary visitors including Working Holiday participants, and permanent residents.</p><p>  Issues around the recognition of Irish qualifications and skills at federal and state level, including driving licence qualifications, are kept under constant review by my officials in the Embassy in Canberra who would be happy to take up specific concerns raised.  I have requested the Ambassador in Canberra to contact the various state and territorial governments to clarify the precise requirements for various categories of Irish licences and the scope for improving recognition of Irish licences.  In addition, the issue of mutual recognition of driving licences is also a topic that under discussion between the European Union and Australia and any changes agreed at this level would apply to Irish licence holders.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-23a.179.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102300052#WRC04100"><p>At the outset, the  Deputy should note that I am aware of the particular difficulties that Clonakilty faces and have been advised by the OPW that consultants have commenced work on an accelerated programme under the South West CFRAM study to assess the flooding situation in Clonakilty and to develop a preferred option for measures to protect the town to an acceptable level from river and tidal flooding.  A Public Information Day was held on 16th March 2012 where the public were invited to provide as much information as possible to the consultants on the flooding events which have occurred in the town.  The consultants work is expected to be finalised by summer 2013.  The preferred option will then have to be progressed to a full scheme design followed by procurement of a contractor.  All this will take some time, however pending this, the OPW has informed me that Cork County Council intends to proceed with interim works to provide some short term alleviation to the flooding situation, primarily focused on measures to improve the surface water drainage in the town.</p><p>  On the issue of a national insurance scheme, it should be noted that this matter  was considered by the previous Government, amongst other options, in the aftermath of the November 2009 flooding and a decision was made not to proceed with such an arrangement because of its   significant cost and also because of  the potential for regulatory issues with such a proposal.  I have recently reviewed this matter and have decided against any further change of policy. Because the vast majority of people are able to obtain flood cover, any such scheme would almost certainly be confined to those areas where the insurance industry has withdrawn cover because of previous claims experience. Due to the limited population base, premiums would either be excessively high in an effort to cover the cost of claims,  or the scheme would never be in a position to meet claims thus creating a large ongoing long-term exposure to the Exchequer.  In addition an inevitable development from the introduction of such a scheme would be a combination of   the withdrawal of insurance companies from high risk and medium risk areas where they currently provide cover (cherrypicking) and people in these areas faced with increasing insurance premiums deciding to discontinue cover on the basis that the state scheme would provide the necessary protection to them at a lesser charge (moral hazard) thereby increasing the burden on the State. </p><p>  It should also be noted that from a regulatory perspective, the Central Bank has previously indicated that creating a State insurance company would raise a range of regulatory and capital issues and that such a proposal has the potential to distort the market and possibly could create state aid issues.  </p><p>  Finally, it is difficult to estimate what the cost to the State of such a  scheme would be as weather events by their nature are unpredictable. However over the 12 year period 2000-2012 the Irish Insurance Federation has indicated that there have been eight major floods costing the insurance industry approximately &euro;672m in flood claims.  These costs to the State would be in addition to the normal infrastructure costs which arise from flooding such as repair of roads, bridges etc which the State as a matter of course looks after.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-23a.195.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102300053#WRD01100"><p>In framing fiscal and economic policy so far, the Government has sought to balance the need to restore confidence in Ireland's fiscal position with the key objective of supporting economic growth that delivers jobs. While the short-run impact of fiscal consolidation may see a reduction in economic output, over the medium term positive effects are expected as the fiscal deficit is reduced and increased investor confidence translates into a lower risk premium which will allow us to sooner put public debt on a declining path.   Recent IMF staff research suggests that the average scale of fiscal multipliers (the effect of consolidation on growth) across countries may have been underestimated in recent years. However this result did not hold for Ireland which suggests that multipliers used by economic forecasters for Ireland are reasonably accurate.</p><p>  Ireland is a small, open economy with imports at over 80% of GDP. This means that a considerable impact of consolidation in Ireland translates into reduced demand in countries we import from, not here at home. Evidence of this can be seen in the current account of the balance of payments which has moved from a deficit of -5.7% of GDP in 2008 to a surplus of 1.1% in 2011.  It is also important to point out that fiscal multipliers vary according to the fiscal instrument used. For example, the impact on aggregate demand as a result of tax changes could be different to the impact from expenditure changes. I would stress, however, that the Government is committed to implementing consolidation in as growth-friendly a manner as possible.</p><p>  Ireland is committed to implementing further consolidation in the years to 2015 in order to correct our excessive deficit. This is designed to sustain investor confidence and keep the cost of borrowing as low as possible to minimise the cost to taxpayers. This strategy has shown recent signs of success with the significant lowering of bond yields since early summer and the successful return of the NTMA to the debt market.</p></reply>

The composition of the metals used in the production of Euro coins is set out in Council Regulations (EC) No 423/1999 and No 975/98, both of which were published in the Official Journal of the European Union.  The Central Bank tenders for its coin blank requirements and does not source the metal to be used.  The Central Bank currently has a framework agreement in place with the South African Mint (Pty) Ltd, for the provision of 1 cent, 2 cent and 5 cent Euro coin blanks. The Central Bank does not currently have a framework agreement in place for the supply of coin blanks for the 10c, 20c, 50c, &euro;1 and &euro;2 coins.  As part of this framework agreement, the South African Mint (Pty) Ltd was required to declare that it is fully compliant in respect of its statutory obligations relating to all relevant employment and Health &amp; Safety legislation and regulations.  The contract in place is for the purchase of coin blanks, as the Central Bank does not itself source metals for the production of Euro coins.</p></reply>

In either situation both parties must be resident in the State for the provision to apply. Where such an election is not made, the payer is entitled to a tax deduction against his or her income for the maintenance payments made.   In the United Kingdom, maintenance payments made under a separation or divorce agreement have not been deductible against the income of the payer since 1988. Additionally, such payments are not taxable in the hands of the recipient under UK law.</p><p>  However, such a maintenance payment made to an Irish resident person by a non-resident individual will be taxed as income arising from a foreign possession under Schedule D of Case III by virtue of section 18 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  It will also attract a universal social charge.  There are no provisions in the Double Taxation agreement between Ireland and the UK to exempt this type of income from Irish tax in the hands of the recipient resident in Ireland.</p><p>  The tax treatment in different countries in relation to various sources of income may not always be similar.  The Double Taxation conventions are not designed to make the tax treatment the same.  Rather they are designed to ensure that Irish tax law is applied in the same way to Irish nationals and nationals of other jurisdictions where they are chargeable to tax in Ireland on similar sources of income.  Irish tax law provides that all maintenance payments are taxable in the hands of the beneficiary. </p><p>  There has been no amendment of the Ireland / UK Double Taxation Agreement in recent years that affects the tax treatment of maintenance payments and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no current proposals to make such an amendment.  The issue of the lack of relief in the United Kingdom for a payment being made which is then properly taxable in this State in the hands of the recipient is one that could be addressed to the taxing authorities in the other jurisdiction.</p></reply>

As I mentioned in reply to Parliamentary Question No 156 of 16 October 2012, I have been advised by the Central Bank that, under the Consumer Protection Code, a regulated entity must act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market. Furthermore, the Code requires a regulated entity to make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer and, in this regard, provision 4.54 of the Code states that: Prior to providing a product or service to a consumer, a regulated entity must: provide the consumer, on paper or another durable medium, with a breakdown of all charges, including third party charges, which will be passed on to the consumer; and where such charges cannot be ascertained in advance, notify the consumer that such charges will be levied as part of the transaction.</p><p>  Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, requires a credit institution to notify the Central Bank of every proposal to increase a previously notified charge or to impose any charge in relation to the provision of a service to a customer that has not been previously notified to the Central Bank. However, third party charges such as legal fees which are being passed on to a customer are not subject to the provisions of Section 149 of the Act.</p></reply>

AIB has informed me that due to the substantial increase in the number of customers in financial difficulty, AIB works with the company referred to in the question who predominantly provide customer case management and assessment services to AIB&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Support Unit. This company operates within AIB&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategy framework and Standards for customer engagement. For commercial reasons AIB does not disclose fee details in relation to external service providers.</p><p>  I have been advised that IBRC has not outsourced the management of any portion of its residential mortgage book to the company referred to in the question. IBRC is fully committed, as part of its mortgage arrears resolution strategy, to taking a proactive approach in managing mortgage arrears. In doing so IBRC identified a specific skills and experience gap in its Mortgage Arrears Support Unit and was determined to fill this gap as a priority. Despite seeking appropriately skilled individuals in the open market, IBRC was unable to secure the necessary skill set required and therefore looked instead to adopt an alternative in-source solution whereby a third party service provider would be contracted under IBRC&rsquo;s normal procurement process to supply IBRC with the appropriate skilled resources required. </p><p>  I have been informed that IBRC&rsquo;s procurement process was followed. A request for quotation was published on OJEU (the official journal of the EU) and tenders were invited, a shortlist of interested firms compiled and following commercial discussions and contract negotiations the contract was awarded to the company referred to in the question.</p><p>  This contract award has resulted in ten employees from this company being contracted to the Bank and deployed to IBRC&rsquo;s residential mortgage division. These employees operate from IBRC premises, using IBRC systems and processes and work alongside IBRC employees.

The composition of a body such as a Fiscal Council is critical to its independence and credibility.

The criteria included the desire of having a mix of appropriate backgrounds, namely academia, the financial sector/financial markets and public finance; expertise in macroeconomic/microeconomic and a strong international dimension, in addition to the need to take gender considerations into account. As would be normal practice, the process by which potential nominees were identified, considered and selected involved officials from my Department.

It is important to note that the circumstances of individuals who are non-resident for tax purposes but who file tax returns can vary widely.  They include, for example, Irish nationals who have moved abroad for work reasons but who retain their home here (their tax return is generally only in respect of rental income on their Irish home); foreign nationals who never resided here but who have investments (including property) here; foreign nationals who worked here for a period and who may have acquired Irish tax residence for that period (for example, individuals who worked here on a temporary assignment) may retain an Irish tax liability, after ceasing to be resident, in respect of investments made in Ireland during their period of residence.

Resources from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) will be channeled through the SIF towards productive investment on commercial terms in the Irish economy. The SIF will seek matching commercial investment from the private sector in order to maximise the resources of the NPRF.   The immediate priority for the Government is to put NewERA on a statutory footing and reorient the NPRF into a Strategic Investment Fund which will make strategic investments to support economic activity, competitiveness and employment in Ireland. Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, which is the Manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary legislation to achieve this objective. It is not expected that legislation will be published before next year.  Establishing a Strategic Investment Bank is a considerably more complex and time-consuming process than establishing the SIF. Given the need in the short term to enable the SIF make investments to support economic activity and employment in Ireland, the development of the SIF and drafting of necessary legislation is being prioritised. </p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears. Some of the new initiatives to assist troubled mortgage customers are detailed below:</p><p>- The Personal Insolvency Bill was approved by Government and published last June and the Committee stage of the Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il last month;</p><p>- The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &ldquo;mortgage to rent&rdquo; scheme on a nationwide basis;</p><p>- Lenders have now provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed forbearance and loan modification options and some forbearance measures have been introduced on a pilot basis with a further roll out later in the year;</p><p>- Also an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website</p><p><i> www.keepingyourhome.ie</i> (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &lsquo;one-to-one&rsquo; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie </i>website.</p><p>The Government remains very committed to progressing these measures, which are in addition to existing supports such as the protections afforded by the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty and the Government sub-committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet to ensure this receives priority attention across relevant Departments and agencies.</p></reply>

The survey will collect information on household composition, employment, incomes, assets, debts and other financial decisions. Similar surveys are being carried out in all other euro area Member States, as part of an initiative to fill the gap in available statistics related to household balance sheets and financial decision making.</p><p>  The main aim of the survey, both at national and euro area level, is to compile micro-level data on household finances, which should provide important insights into the economic behavior of households. The Irish survey is being conducted on the basis of a common questionnaire and methodology to be applied across all participating countries to provide information on the situation in the euro area as a whole, while also allowing comparisons to be made across countries.  The first results of the survey, which will take some time to carry out, will be available in 2014.   </p></reply>

However, the Central Bank has<i></i>no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997.    The lending institutions in Ireland are independent commercial entities. Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including, interest rates and products is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each lending institution, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each lending institution, including deposit pricing, is under pressure. </p><p>  However, within its existing powers and through the use of suasion, the Central Bank will continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.  All mortgage lenders were written to and asked to consider the impact on arrears when considering any future interest rate increases.</p><p>  Given the increased financial pressures currently being experienced by mortgage consumers, the Central Bank was of the view that they needed sufficient time to plan for any increases in their standard variable interest rate.  The Central Bank advised mortgage lenders that it expects them to notify affected consumers, in writing, at least one month in advance of any increases in their standard variable rate.  This notification must include:</p><p>  a)The date from which the new rate will apply;</p><p>  b)The details of the old and new rate;</p><p>  c)The revised repayment amount; and</p><p>  d)An invitation for the consumer to contact the lender if he/she anticipates difficulties meeting the higher repayments.</p><p>  With regard to consumers in arrears or in danger of going into financial difficulty and/or concerned about going into mortgage arrears, the revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) offers increased protections to these consumers.  The revised CCMA was issued to mortgage lenders on 6 December 2010 and is effective from 1 January 2011.  It builds on the provisions of the previous version, but includes more detailed requirements, including the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). Other examples of significant changes are: </p><p>  - pre-arrears cases must be treated in accordance with the MARP; </p><p>  - arrears have been defined; </p><p>  - the primary residences which can be protected by the CCMA have been defined; and </p><p>  - an Appeals process under the CCMA replaces the complaints process under the Consumer Protection Code. </p><p>The Central Bank has also published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears &#8216;<b>Mortgage Arrears &#8211; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender&#8217;</b>   and this is available on the Central Bank website. </p><p><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p></reply>

Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion this year and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. The pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.</p><p>  Oversight by the CRO applies to both pillar banks - AIB and Bank of Ireland. SMEs, sole traders or farmers can apply for a review where credit is refused, withdrawn, or offered on unreasonable conditions. Banks have set up formal internal review processes, which must first examine an appeal by a customer. Ulster Bank has also set up an internal appeal process.

In addition, we will not increase the top marginal rates of taxes on income. There are no plans at this time to depart from this policy. I should point out that the top marginal rate of taxation on income is now 52 per cent for PAYE workers and 55 per cent for the self-employed. The latest OECD data indicates that Ireland has the most progressive tax system of the EU members of its organisation. A progressive taxation system ensures that the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay. </p><p>  In addition, it is estimated that in 2012, the top 5 per cent of income earners will pay 43 per cent of the total income tax, while it is estimated that those earning &euro;50,000 or less, which represents 78 per cent of income earners, will pay 20 per cent of the total income tax. Furthermore, it is estimated that in 2012, 841,100 individuals, who represents 39 per cent of the income tax base, will be exempt from income tax. When marginal rates of tax are very high, jobs are lost. Indirect taxes have a less adverse impact on employment. That is why in the last Budget, indirect taxes rather that taxes on income were increased. </p><p>  However, that does not mean that the wealthy should not carry the principal burden of tax. The minimum effective tax restriction on high earners is designed to ensure this by imposing a minimum effective income tax rate of 30 per cent for those subject to the full restriction, in addition to 4 per cent in PRSI and up to 10 per cent in the USC.</p></reply>

It is instructive to note, however, that, as set out in its most recent Section 55 Quarterly Accounts published last week, the Agency made a net profit of &euro;89 million during the three months ending 30th June 2012 and an overall net profit of &euro;222 million for the first half of the year.  I welcome the strong financial performance to which these figures attest and hope that the Agency performs as well during the second half of the year.     The Deputy will appreciate that there is a significant difference in terms of the rigour required between, on the one hand, the formal provision by the Minister for Finance before the Houses of the Oireachtas of projections pertaining to an entity under his auspices and, on the other, an informal forecast made by the Agency&rsquo;s Chief Executive during an interview with an international media outlet. </p></reply>

As a result none of its commercial property loans were acquired by NAMA in 2010.  The Deputy will also be aware that only Land and Development loans in the participating institutions were acquired by NAMA from those institutions.  The NAMA Act does not allow for a scenario where NAMA would service assets which have not been acquired by it.  Permanent TSB is not currently selling its commercial property loan assets and therefore an analysis of the impact of an acquisition of Permanent TSB&rsquo;s commercial property loans by NAMA would have limited value.</p></reply>

The concept was to strengthen these banks through recapitalisation and restructuring in order that they could play a material role in the provision of credit to the economy, as universal banks providing nationwide coverage and a full range of services to retail, SME and corporate customers.     At that time the future strategic direction of Permanent TSB was less certain.  Since then we have agreed a way forward for Permanent TSB with the Troika which envisages it playing an important role in the future of Irish retail banking, being a more focussed retail bank bringing an element of competition to the marketplace which has consolidated significantly since 2008.  In this regard Permanent TSB submitted a restructuring plan to the European Commission in June 2012. </p></reply>

The estimated full year yield from applying a 50% flat rate of tax to the gross income from all sources returned by self-employed individuals engaged in these activities would be of the order of &euro;14 million. If the 50% tax is intended to replace the existing liability to income tax the net yield would be approximately &euro;10 million.</p><p>  The corresponding full year yield from applying a 50% flat rate of tax to the trading income returned by companies engaged in these activities is estimated at &euro;54 million.  If the 50% tax is intended to replace the existing liability to corporation tax the net yield would be approximately &euro;44 million.  Figures are rounded to the nearest million.  It is assumed that none of the tax credits, reliefs or deductions that are normally allowable under the rules of income tax and corporation tax would be allowed in applying the flat rate of tax.</p><p>  The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4 digit &ldquo;NACE code (Rev. 1)&rdquo; which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources. NACE code classifications on tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf and the taxes collected are allocated to those codes without reference to the precise economic activity which generated them.</p><p>  While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided. The sectors identified for this reply represent the closest equivalents in the NACE code system to the sectors mentioned in the question.</p></reply>

NTMA completed an auction of Irish Treasury Bills on 18 October 2012 selling the target amount of &euro;500 million. Total bids received amounted to &euro;1.8 billion which was 3.6 times the amount on offer. The Treasury Bills, which have a maturity of three months, were sold at an annualised yield of 0.70%.  I am advised by the NTMA that there are no legal or dealer fees on top of the actual annualised interest rate paid on Irish Treasury Bills, either upon issuance or redemption. Relatively minor transaction settlement costs are paid to an intermediary bank, to cover the cost of settling Treasury Bills sold to the Primary Dealers through whom the Agency markets Irish government debt.</p></reply>

There are a number of tests for solvency set out in company law. These solvency tests must be distinguished from the requirements of PCAR (which tests capital adequacy). The concept of trading while insolvent is one of company law while the PCAR is a test which set down by the Central Bank.   It is not the case that a bank which does not meet a capital adequacy requirement is automatically trading while insolvent.  While the recapitalised banks required fresh capital to meet the various capital adequacy requirements set by the Central Bank it is not the case that those banks were trading while insolvent.

As Minister for Finance I would have no role in reviewing licence conditions imposed by the Central Bank in its regulatory capacity.    I have been informed by the Central Bank that it does not comment on the individual licence conditions imposed on specific credit institutions and that once a licence is issued it becomes the property of the relevant credit institution and thus the Central Bank retains no right to publish copies. Copies are kept by the Central Bank but they are not available for examination. However, pursuant to Section 12(1) of the Central Bank Act 1971, the Central Bank publishes a full list of authorised credit institutions and their status on its website. </p><p>  The Central Bank does not impose any general restrictions on foreign credit institutions operating in Ireland. However, the Central Bank has the power to impose specific licence conditions on any domestic or foreign credit institution licensed to operate in Ireland. Each individual application for a licence is considered and treated on an individual basis to determine which conditions will apply.</p><p>  Section 7 of the Central Bank Act 1971 (as amended) provides that &lsquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person, other than a Bank, shall not, in or outside the State, carry on banking business or hold himself out or represent himself as a banker or as carrying on banking business or on behalf of any other person accept deposits or other repayable funds from the public, unless he is the holder of a licence&rsquo;. Under section 58 of the Central Bank Act 1971, contravention of section 7 is an offence. Therefore it is not possible to operate as a bank in the absence of a licence without committing an offence.</p><p>  The Central Bank is responsible for monitoring whether or not credit institutions are complying with any conditions imposed on their respective licenses. Credit Institutions are also responsible for monitoring their compliance with licence conditions and reporting any breaches to the Central Bank.</p><p>  The Central Bank may impose conditions on the licence of a bank pursuant to section 10 of the Central bank Act 1971. The failure by a bank to comply with a condition which the Central Bank has imposed is a serious matter as reflected in the consequences of such a failure, these include:</p><p>  a) section 58 of the Central Bank Act 1971, provides that the contravention of such a condition is a criminal offence and may, on summary conviction, lead to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,270 or to a imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;63,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both;</p><p>  b) The Central Bank may utilize its administrative sanctions powers under section 33AQ of the Central Bank Act 1971 which could expose the bank to a sanction of &euro;5,000,000.</p><p>  c) Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 provides that such a sanction may include suspension or revocation of a banking licence.</p><p>  Section 11 of the Central Bank Act 1971 sets out the grounds for revocation of a bank licence including if the holder becomes unable to meet his obligations to his creditors or suspends payments lawfully due.</p><p>  In the event of a customer being affected by a credit institution operating in breach of regulatory requirements, that customer has in the first instance the option of seeking redress from the institution in question. Failing that or if the customer is not satisfied with the outcome, there is the option of bringing the dispute to the Financial Services Ombudsman or the Courts. </p><p>  I propose to shortly bring forward amendments at Committee Stage of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill which will introduce greater clarity for customers seeking compensation for losses arising from the failure of a credit institution to comply with its obligations.</p><p>The Central Bank Act 1971 does not deal with the question of the validity of any contract entered into by a bank in breach of the requirement to hold a banking licence and the consequences of such would have to be assessed by the Courts on the face of each case before them  .</p></reply>

Under the provision, a Stamp Duty charge would attach to the contract or agreement for sale where the vendor receives a payment amounting to 25% or more of the purchase price concerned.  Section 31A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 was subject to a commencement order on the basis that it would be prudent to consider the state of the housing and property market before the provision is put into place.</p><p>  The previous Government commissioned an independent study of the potential effects that such a provision may have on the market. Of particular importance is that the report indicates that it would have led to a rise in land prices, with a knock-on increase in house prices, especially for first-time buyers, and possibly risked exacerbating the down-turn in the property market. The independent study examined Section 31A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 as inserted by section 110 Finance Act 2007.  This was repealed by section 82 Finance (No. 2) Act 2008, which inserted a similar provision to the original section 31A provision. </p><p>  The commencement of Section 31A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 is kept under constant review and has to take into account circumstances in the housing and property markets.  There is currently no requirement to make Stamp Duty returns to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of these transactions as they are not liable to Stamp Duty. There is therefore no specific data on which to accurately estimate any revenue forgone as a result of the provision not being commenced.  However, having regard to the fall in Stamp Duty rates, the reduction in property values and inactivity in the property market it is estimated that any revenue foregone is minimal.</p></reply>

In addition, it is assumed that the 3 new tax rates and bands proposed would be integrated in the current tax system together rather than in isolation.  On the above basis, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2013 incomes, of the introduction of a new rates and bands would be of the order of &#8364;1.1 billion. However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such new rates could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</p><p>  It is not possible to measure in a precise manner the impact that changes to tax rates and tax bands, which are based on <i>taxable</i> income values, will have on effective tax rates, which are normally measured by reference to <i>gross</i>   income, because these income types are, generally speaking, not comparable. However, an indicative measure can be derived by examining the effect of the proposed changes on the average effective tax rate on all earners with gross incomes exceeding &#8364;100,000. On that basis the proposed changes would give rise to average effective income tax rate of 31.1% compared with a rate of 25.6% under the existing system.</p><p>  The figures refer to income tax only, excluding USC and PRSI.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-23a.356.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102300055#WRF03100"><p>A schedular system of taxation operates in Ireland, as in many other countries, under which income is grouped into separate schedules for tax assessment purposes. Different rules apply for calculating taxable income under each schedule and for determining the timing of the charge to tax. Any change to treat capital gains on asset disposals as income subject to income tax would have fundamental implications for the schedular system.   In the case of income tax, for example, a system of allowances, rate bands and tax credits are in place, the extent of the availability of which depends on the personal circumstances of each taxpayer. Income is charged to tax on a graduated basis at rates of 20% and/or 41% depending on whether an individual is single, married, a single earner couple or a two earner couple. The result is a highly progressive system with individuals paying more tax as they earn more income.</p><p>  Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is chargeable on gains made on the disposal of assets. Persons are chargeable to CGT on such gains for a year depending on their residence and domicile. Gains subject to CGT are generally less recurring events for the majority of individuals than annual income chargeable to income tax. The first &euro;1,270 of an individual&rsquo;s net gains for a year (that is gains minus current year losses and losses brought forward from earlier years) is exempt from CGT with the balance taxed at a standard rate of 30%. The standard rate of CGT has increased from 20% to 30% in recent years. The non-recurring nature of many capital gains and the equitable treatment, under an income tax system which taxes income as it arises in a single year, of gains accrued over a number of years from the periodic disposal of capital assets are some of the considerations inherent in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.   </p><p>  It should also be noted that income earned from capital assets (e.g. rental income from property or dividend income from investments) is liable to income tax and USC etc in the hands of an individual. The taxation system therefore imposes a charge to income tax, and consequently imposes PRSI and USC, where any income arises, whether that income is in the form of pay or emoluments of an individual or profits from an investment.</p><p>  Any decision to apply higher taxes to gains from asset disposals would have to consider, among other things, the negative implications for ongoing investment in productive assets.  To impose a charge equivalent to income tax, USC and PRSI on capital disposals is also likely to lead to other behavioural impacts with an effect on the transfer of ownership of assets, possibly leading to stagnation in the market in terms of such transfers, as assets will pass on death rather than by disposal. Charging capital gains to income tax will raise the question of when relief would be granted for capital losses.</p><p>  Finally, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from applying income tax, USC and PRSI to capital gains would depend on the individual circumstances of each affected taxpayer such as the amount of each gain, the amount of other income, the marital status and the PRSI class. There would also be an uncertainty about the behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers, as outlined above, where a significant increase in the tax rate on gains may not produce a corresponding increase in tax yield. In current economic conditions any estimate of additional yield would have to be treated with caution.</p></reply>

In that context, I must state that this is a hypothetical exercise.   It is possible to provide an estimate on a straight line arithmetic basis. However in reality it is impossible to estimate the level of additional tax revenue that would be realised due to behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a result of such a measure which would be a significant factor.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated in terms of expected 2012 profits, of increasing the standard rate of corporation tax from 12.5% to 15%, 17.5%, 20% and 21.8% is tentatively estimated on a straight line arithmetic basis to be about &euro;675 million, &euro;1,350 million, &euro;2,025 million and  &euro;2,511 million respectively. </p><p>  While this estimate is technically correct it does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence. In terms of an increase in the 12.5% rate, estimating the size of the behavioural effects is difficult but they are likely to be relatively significant. An OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average.  On this basis, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland&rsquo;s inward investment by nearly 10%. This assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland. </p><p>  The very major importance of maintaining the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax to Ireland&rsquo;s international competitive position in the current climate must also be borne in mind.  Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe. A low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries.  Ireland&rsquo;s low corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.  Recent research by the OECD also points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth. </p><p>  Further, it would be difficult to justify such a move in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s stated position that we will not change our corporation tax strategy. Even a marginal change would undermine both our long held stance on this issue and the certainty of business, domestic and international, in our resolve to maintain that position.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters. These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution.  Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.</p><p>  However, the Government is aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty.  In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears. </p><p>  A number of significant milestones have now been achieved:-<blockquote>  -The Personal Insolvency Bill was approved by Government and published last June and the Committee stage of the Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il last month;  <br /><br /><br />  -The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis;<br /><br /><br />  -Lenders have now provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed forbearance and loan modification options and some forbearance measures have been introduced on a pilot basis with a further roll out later in the year; <br /><br />-Also an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website   </blockquote><i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i> (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the www.keepingyourhome.ie   website.</p><p>  The Government remains very committed to progressing these measures, which are in addition to existing supports such as the protections afforded by the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty and the Government sub-committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet to ensure this receives priority attention across relevant Departments and agencies.</p></reply>

It should be noted that there have been changes since this period, i.e. some schemes have been abolished or modified and others have been introduced. For instance, as the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and this year&rsquo;s Finance Act provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Capital Allowance Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.</p><p><b>Index of Tables and Notes</b></p><p>a) Note on the Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009</p><p>b) Table IT 6 showing Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009. Figures of cost in relation to corporation tax are included in the &ldquo;<b>Income Tax and/or Corporation Tax</b>&rdquo; section of this table.</p><p>c) Notes on Table IT 6</p><p>d) Note on Green Paper on Pensions</p><p>e) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009.</p><p>f) Note on reliefs in respect of which costs are not currently quantifiable or are negligible or are not identifiable within total aggregates.</p><p>Work is ongoing to update the costs to 2010 terms but this is not yet complete.</p><p><b>a) Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009</b></p><p>The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system. A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.  An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.</p><p>The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.</p><p>In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the &ldquo;costs&rdquo; of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a &ldquo;loss of tax revenue&rdquo; on profits. To compute such &ldquo;loss&rdquo;, regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.</p><p>The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.</p><p>The figures of cost are for 2008 and 2009 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.</p><p>The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).</p><p>The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.</p><p>In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged. It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with &euro;1,000 gross trading profits, &euro;1,000 capital allowances and &euro;1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on &euro;1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on &euro;1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.</p><p>The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.</p><p>Apart from the artists exemption, these figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007. The restriction was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.</p><p>Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information.</p><p><b> b) Table IT 6 showing Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009</b></p><p><b>INCOME TAX AND CORPORATION TAX</b></p><p><b>Table IT6</b></p><p><b>Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Tax Relief Provision </b></th><th><div><b>(1) Estimated cost for 2008</b></div></th><th><b></b></th><th><div><b>(1) Estimated cost for 2009</b></div></th><th><b></b></th></tr><tr><td><b>INCOME TAX</b></td><td><b>&#8364;m</b></td><td><b>Numbers</b></td><td><b>&#8364;m</b></td><td><b>Numbers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Exemption limits:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>General Exemption (2) </td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Child Addition (2)</td><td><div>0.3</div></td><td><div>900</div></td><td><div>0.2</div></td><td><div>800</div></td></tr><tr><td>Age Exemption (2)</td><td><div>90.8</div></td><td><div>57,700</div></td><td><div>82.4</div></td><td><div>54,900</div></td></tr><tr><td>Married Person's Credit (3)</td><td><div>2,944.90</div></td><td><div>853,100</div></td><td><div>2,853.20</div></td><td><div>835,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Single Person's Credit (3)</td><td><div>2,406.80</div></td><td><div>1,503,300</div></td><td><div>2,088.20</div></td><td><div>1,316,900</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widowed Person's Credit (3)</td><td><div>184.3</div></td><td><div>81,100</div></td><td><div>184.8</div></td><td><div>81,100</div></td></tr><tr><td>Additional Credit to Widowed Person in Year of Bereavement </td><td><div>4.9</div></td><td><div>4,000</div></td><td><div>4.9</div></td><td><div>4,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Additional Bereavement Credit to Widowed Parent </td><td><div>6.9</div></td><td><div>2,300</div></td><td><div>6.2</div></td><td><div>2,400</div></td></tr><tr><td>Additional Personal Credit for Lone Parent</td><td><div>197.4</div></td><td><div>116,700</div></td><td><div>174.1</div></td><td><div>103,600</div></td></tr><tr><td>Homecarer Credit</td><td><div>79.5</div></td><td><div>93,100</div></td><td><div>63.9</div></td><td><div>77,500</div></td></tr><tr><td>Additional Credit for Incapacitated Child </td><td><div>39</div></td><td><div>12,300</div></td><td><div>38</div></td><td><div>12,200</div></td></tr><tr><td>Employee (PAYE) Credit</td><td><div>3,253.80</div></td><td><div>1,710,200</div></td><td><div>2,995.20</div></td><td><div>1,560,600</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dependent Relative Credit </td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>18,700</div></td><td><div>2.1</div></td><td><div>18,200</div></td></tr><tr><td>Person Taking Care of Incapacitated Taxpayer </td><td><div>5.8</div></td><td><div>1,260</div></td><td><div>5.9</div></td><td><div>1470</div></td></tr><tr><td>Age Credit</td><td><div>42.3</div></td><td><div>88,100</div></td><td><div>43.7</div></td><td><div>90,700</div></td></tr><tr><td>Blind Person's Credit (incl.Guide Dog Allowance)</td><td><div>2.1</div></td><td><div>1,320</div></td><td><div>1.9</div></td><td><div>1190</div></td></tr><tr><td>Medical Insurance Premiums (4)</td><td><div>321</div></td><td><div>1,322,400</div></td><td><div>589.6</div></td><td><div>1,233,900</div></td></tr><tr><td>Health Expenses </td><td><div>266.8</div></td><td><div>542,600</div></td><td><div>145.5</div></td><td><div>492,800</div></td></tr><tr><td>Contributions Under Permanent Health Benefit Schemes, after Deduction of Tax on Benefits Received (5)</td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>29,200</div></td><td><div> 3.9</div></td><td><div> 27,300</div></td></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions To Approved Superannuation Schemes (6)</td><td><div>655</div></td><td><div>792,600</div></td><td><div>729</div></td><td><div>713,600</div></td></tr><tr><td>Employers' Contributions To Approved Superannuation Schemes  (6)</td><td><div>165</div></td><td><div>362,700</div></td><td><div>153</div></td><td><div>342,200</div></td></tr><tr><td>Exemption of Investment Income and Gains of Approved Superannuation Funds  (6)* </td><td><div>685</div></td><td><div>N/A</div></td><td><div>780</div></td><td><div>N/A</div></td></tr><tr><td>Exemption of employers' contributions from employee BIK (6)</td><td><div>595</div></td><td><div>362,700</div></td><td><div>558</div></td><td><div>342,200</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tax Relief on &quot;tax free&quot;

They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.</p><p>(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.</p><p>(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.</p><p>(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a &ldquo;net pay&rdquo; basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.</p><p>(6) See the following note on &ldquo;Green Paper on Pensions&rdquo; for background commentary on the basis of the cost figures .</p><p>(7) &ldquo;Other&rdquo; relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership .</p><p>(8) The income on which the cost of exemption from income tax for charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. is based includes dividend income on which income tax deducted at source has been repaid, other investment income, payments received under covenant, donations by the PAYE sector to approved bodies together with the associated tax relief and donations by the self-employed and corporate sectors to approved bodies and approved sports bodies. Information is not available about other income received gross.</p><p>(9) The cost figures for relief for certain Sports Persons are based on income tax self assessment returns and for donations to Approved Sports Bodies are based on income tax and corporation tax self assessment returns.</p><p>(10) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be more appropriate.</p><p>(11) The costs and numbers for the Exemption of Statutory Redundancy Payments are based on external data. From 2009 the &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; indicate the numbers of claims received in the year and not the numbers of claims approved.</p><p>(12) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2008 and 2009.</p><p>(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with &ldquo;unused capital allowances&rdquo;, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company&rsquo;s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that &euro;3587 million and &euro;5373 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2008 and 2009 accounting periods respectively but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.</p><p>(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2008 and 2009 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.</p><p>(15) the cost shown for manufacturing relief for 2008 is compiled using the basic data available but for technical reasons associated with a system redesign it is understood to be understated by at least &euro;100m.</p><p>(16) The costs shown for R&amp;D is for claims for R&amp;D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2008 and 2009. However, the cost for 2009 includes the amount of credit allowed against 2009 tax together with the amount offset against tax of previous accounting periods and as payable credits.</p><p><b>d) Note on Green Paper on Pensions - Review of estimates of cost</b></p><p>As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.</p><p>The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2008 and 2009 are included in table IT6.</p><p>The breakdown and make-up of these estimated costs of reliefs differ from presentations of costs in this area for years PRIOR TO 2005 in a number of respects and are not directly comparable. further details on the cost of tax and other reliefs and the changes in the methodology are contained in pages 106 and 107 of the Green Paper on Pensions which is available at www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie.</p><p><b>e) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009</b></p><p>Certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax - uptake and estimated potential cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone based on 2008 and 2009 tax returns</p><p>Provisions were included in the Finance Acts of 2003 and 2004 to enable new statistical data on the uptake of tax relief for certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax to be obtained from tax returns.

This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually subject to tax.</p><p>- Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6.

These guidance notes are for guidance only and do not form  part of the Public Works Contract.  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is the statutory body  established to monitor, inspect and enforce issues relating to employment  rights compliance. My Department is not in a position to independently  investigate allegations of non-compliance. Allegations should be referred to  NERA or other statutory bodies established to investigate such matters.</p><p>  My Department is however continually seeking ways of improving the  effectiveness of the delivery of the school building programme particularly in  the area of compliance. In this regard my Department has recently published a  contract notice with the intention of establishing a drawdown framework for  &quot;pay and conditions audits&quot;. The intention is to improve existing processes for  assessing potential risks and verifying compliance with regard to pay and  conditions on school building projects. This framework will complement the work  undertaken by the relevant statutory bodies. It is not intended to use this  framework to investigate complaints by third parties. Such complaints should  continue to be referred to the relevant statutory authority set up to  investigate such complaints.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of recent reforms introduced by my colleague the  Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. A new Workplace Relations  Customer Services section was recently set up on foot of an amalgamation of the  information services previously provided by the National Employment Rights  Authority's Contact Centre and the general enquiries areas of the Equality  Tribunal, the Rights Commissioner Service and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  This section has responsibility for information provision in relation to  employment, equality and IR rights and obligations, the receipt and  registration of all complaints referred to the five Workplace Relations Bodies  (namely the Labour Relations Commission, Equality Tribunal, National Employment  Rights Authority, Employment Appeals Tribunal and Labour Court) and dealing  with enquiries concerning all complaints.</p><p>  Part of Minister Bruton's reform programme includes the Early Resolution  Service (ERS). This new service envisages the provision of an early resolution  service to employers and employees insofar as complaints and referrals for  hearing and adjudication are concerned. This will involve an assessment of  eligibility, engaging with the parties to the dispute, securing willingness by  parties to participate on a voluntary basis in early resolution using a range  of intervention tools including email and telephone communication. Cases which  cannot be resolved by the Early Resolution Service within a target period will  be referred to the Workplace Relations Customer Services for onward  transmission to the relevant service with a view to progression to the relevant  hearing or to inspection.</p><p>  From 3rd January 2012 all complaints to the five Workplace Relations Bodies,  have been channelled through Workplace Relations Customer Services, where they  are registered, acknowledged and referred to the relevant adjudication body.

The Student Support Act 2011 contains an enabling provision for the purpose of including part-time courses in the student grant schemes when resources permit.

Full details of this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.  Springboard, which was first launched in May 2011, is a specific initiative that strategically targets funding of free part-time higher education courses for unemployed people in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages or employment opportunities.  To be eligible for a place on a Springboard course a person must be unemployed, actively seeking employment, and be in receipt of one of the qualifying payments from the Department of Social Protection or be signing for credits or be previously self employed.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012. All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have now been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the current school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  In making allocations for SNA support for schools, the NCSE considers all of the applications made by schools for children who have been identified in medical reports as having care needs.  The NCSE also reviews any existing SNA provision. In cases where children have diminishing care needs, the NCSE may reduce SNA support for those children. Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts.</p><p>  Interim alleviation measures were announced in August 2012 for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level. School Management bodies were notified of these arrangements at the beginning of the current school year. Applications for alleviation have been received from 127 post primary schools. These applications have been processed and schools have been notified of the outcome in the recent weeks.

In relation to school transport provision, ethos relates to religious ethos and is in the context of provision for minority religions. Eligibility for school transport is not determined by way of subject choice.</p><p>  Existing catchment boundary pupils who are not attending their nearest post primary centre will retain their transport eligibility for the duration of their post primary education cycle provided there is no change to their current circumstances. Siblings of these pupils and other pupils, who are not eligible for school transport, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only in accordance with the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme. The changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme are being applied equitably on a national basis.</p><p>  The routing and timetabling of school transport services are an operational matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann and are not a determining factor in establishing eligibility for school transport.  The main objective of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme is to support the safe transport to and from school of children who would have difficulty travelling, for reasons of distance, to their nearest school if transport is not supported. While it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice, eligibility for school transport is to the nearest school, having regard for ethos and language.  While contact was previously made with South Tipperary VEC on the matter, officials in my Department will be in further written contact shortly. </p></reply>

Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &ndash; some &euro;1.3 billion &ndash; was spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs in 2011. The provision for the current year is in line with expenditure last year and reflects this Government's commitment to prioritising supports for children with special educational needs, at a time when there is a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.</p><p>  The vast majority of support for childcare, including pre-school education, is not provided by my Department but is provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The principal vehicle for delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for one year's free pre-school attendance for each eligible child. There is provision under the programme to allow children with special needs to split the pre-school year over two years on a pro-rata basis, availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year. The programme also provides for an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.</p><p>  In relation to Primary and Post Primary provision, I wish to reiterate this Government's commitment to the protection of frontline services for pupils with special educational needs. Significant additional supports will continue to be provided to enable schools to cater for the needs of students with special educational needs, including 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs); approximately 9,950 learning support/resource teacher posts; over 1,100 teachers in special schools which operate at much reduced pupil: teacher ratios; enhanced levels of school capitation for special schools and special classes; special School Transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities and Assistive Technology support.</p><p>  In relation to Higher Education, I wish to advise the Deputy that every Higher Education Institution has at least one member of staff with responsibility for liaising with students with disabilities, as required by the Disability Act. This is the minimum however, and in many cases, in particular in the university sector, there are dedicated Disability Support Services with a Head of Service and specialist staff. In addition, a number of Institutes of Technology have both Disability or Learning Support Officers as well as an Access Officer. Institutions are required to have access plans in place to accommodate the groups under-represented in third level institutions, which includes students with a disability, and on that basis progress continues to be made in this area.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to clarify that the continued commitment of this Government to special education provision, at a time when savings are being required across a range of expenditure areas has ensured that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.</p></reply>

These programmes are aimed at adults with less than upper second level education and a range of target groups within them, including Travellers.  It is a matter for each VEC to decide the nature, extent and organisation of courses provided within its budget allocation under the ALCES and BTEI programmes.  The school in question should contact County Mayo VEC in relation to its proposal.</p></reply>

The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually.

They are however, eligible to apply for assistance provided they satisfy the terms and conditions in relation to nationality, residency, academic attainment and means.  Previously Science Foundation Ireland, in conjunction with DELL, provided targeted scholarships to female students undertaking an undergraduate degree in engineering. This award programme has been running since 2006/07 but it is not envisaged that any new awards will be made in the current academic year.  In addition, Discover Science and Engineering and the STEPS programme promote female participation in science and engineering and provide support to such initiatives on a continuous basis.</p></reply>

Springboard, which was first launched in May 2011, is a specific initiative that strategically targets funding of free part-time higher education courses for unemployed people in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages or employment opportunities.  To be eligible for a place on a Springboard course a person must be unemployed, actively seeking employment, and be in receipt of one of the qualifying payments from the Department of Social Protection or be signing for credits or be previously self employed. Full details can be accessed on the dedicated Springboard website www.springboardcourses.ie.</p><p>  Other supports available to students include the Student Assistance Fund which will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.  Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.  Parents engage tutors directly. The grant is paid in advance to the parent on a twice yearly basis, where possible, or monthly in arrears where several tutors provide tuition to the same child, or where the tutor has been sanctioned on a short term basis. The tutor in this instance has been sanctioned on a short term basis.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, the tutor has been sanctioned on a short term basis to the 26th October 2012 and an advance payment cannot therefore issue. </p></reply>

There are currently over 4,700 such posts at an annual cost of circa &euro;282 million allocated to primary schools.  This expenditure includes the standard learning support/language support allocation that is given to all schools and the additional support that is provided to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language support. The need to reform the allocation of the General Allocation Model arose because the existing system operated  primarily on the basis of 2003 enrolments which are long out of date and had been criticised by the Ombudsman for Children. Schools now have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs. The new single allocation for the General Allocation Model (GAM) and language support is based on the number of classroom teaching posts in each school in the previous school year. This simplified approach to (GAM) will make it easier to automatically update it annually in line with the changes in the number of classroom teachers in each school.</p></reply>

The provision for the current year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, the overall level of funding for special education has not been cut.</p><p> - Approximately 9,950 learning support/resource teacher posts, including those provided under the General Allocation Model, are also being provided in primary &amp; post primary schools in order to provide additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.</p><p> - Over 1,100 teachers are also being provided for in special schools providing teaching to pupils with various disabilities at much reduced pupil: teacher ratios, for example the autism PTR is 6:1 and the moderate general learning disability PTR is 8:1.</p><p> - Enhanced levels of school capitation are payable to most special schools and special classes and special School Transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities are provided at a cost of over &euro;60m per year.</p><p> - Approximately &euro;1.3m is also provided annually to schools for assistive technology support.</p><p> - Early educational intervention is provided for children with autism from 2&frac12; years of age. There are now 76 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by the Department. Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism aged from 2 &frac12; years to 5 who are unable to access an early intervention class.</p><p> - An extended school year is also currently available for pupils who have either a severe/profound general learning disability or who have autism.</p><p>  The continued commitment of this Government to special education provision, at a time when savings are being required across a range of expenditure areas has ensured that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that it is my intention that resources available to my Department are utilised to optimum benefit to ensure the best possible outcomes for students with special educational needs. In this regard my Department is seeking advice from the NCSE on policy options for the allocation of these resources in future, with a view to ensuring that the most appropriate and efficient model is in place in the coming years.</p></reply>

SUSI is currently accepting applications after the official closing date in line with the discretion given to it under the Student Grant Scheme 2012. An additional 8,731 late applications have been received since the closing date. Priority is being given to applications received before the official closing date.</p><p>  SUSI has completed initial assessments on a total of 60,227 of applications which have been approved to move to the documentary evidence stage of the process. 5,108 applications submitted after the official closing date are awaiting initial assessment.</p><p>  Decisions have issued in respect of 13,486 applications, 3,795 of which have already been awarded a grant and 9,691 of which have either been refused or cancelled, where adequate documentary evidence has been submitted to enable a final decision to be made on an application. Students began to receive grant approval letters from SUSI on a rolling basis from 5th October.</p><p>  As part of the overall improvement in service, all new student grants approved for this academic year will be paid by electronic funds transfer on a monthly basis directly to students' bank accounts, rather than by cheque to the relevant college. Those awarded a grant must supply bank account details and confirmation of registration must be received from the institution in order for the first instalment to be paid. Payments to students have commenced and will continue on a weekly rolling basis as grants are approved and bank details have been supplied by the student. Some 663 students received payment directly to their bank account on the 19th October.</p></reply>

There are still 16,351 cases where no documentation has been furnished by the applicants in response to SUSI's request. In addition, in a very significant number of cases an incomplete set of documentation was received and SUSI has had to make further requests to these students to submit the outstanding information.  19,629 document packs are currently in the process of being validated by SUSI &ndash; some 89% of these are cases where the initial pack submitted by the applicant was incomplete.</p><p>  The submission of supporting documentation by students together with submitting a fully complete and legible application form has tradionally given rise to difficulties in relation to the timely processing of applications for student grants. The online application process addresses the issue of incomplete and difficult to read applications.</p><p>  In order to ensure a decision on a student's application, it is critical that the required supporting documentation is provided. A number of measures were put in place by SUSI to try to address the perennial issue of incomplete documentation. Every student is issued with a personalised checklist of the documentation required to support their student grant application.  The student also receives a guide which outlines where the requested documents may be sourced.  The purpose of this process is to offer the student as much assistance as possible in returning the requested information.  Copies of all requested documentation is now acceptable. In the past only original documentation was accepted.  A pre-addressed envelope is included with the pack to facilitate the return of these documents. In spite of these measures there continues to be a significant number of applications where full documentation has not been submitted.</p><p>  Where the applicant has not yet returned the outstanding documentation, SUSI is continuing to contact the applicants by email and text message to enable the applications to proceed to final decision stage. The matter of outstanding documentation is being kept under continuous review to ensure that every effort is being made to progress applications to final decisions as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The key needs will be for professional development in assessment approaches, in school moderation, in the development of short courses, and in subject reforms.  Given the budgetary circumstances, it will be necessary to provide for these funds through a redeployment of existing resources within the Department's budget, while also finding the savings already necessary within the Budget.  From 2017 onwards there will be some savings in the budget of the State Examinations Commission as the role of the Commission in assessment at junior cycle is reduced, but these will be absorbed in the reform of the Leaving Certificate and in ongoing implementation of reform at Junior Cycle.</p></reply>

These include subject specifications with clear learning outcomes; a comprehensive profession development programme for teachers, principals and deputy principals in educational assessment, including processes of moderation; and the introduction of standarised tests for all schools and students in English reading, Mathematics and Science and in Irish reading for Irish-medium schools; the development of an assessment and moderation toolkit.</p><p>  Additional quality assurance measures in relation to assessment at end of junior cycle include the following:&#8226; The SEC will provide final assessment papers and marking schemes for subjects until the new school-based system of assessment is fully established<blockquote>-  For English, Irish and Mathematics, the SEC will initially mark these papers. This arrangement will continue until standardised testing becomes established in junior cycle;<br /><br />-  For the school work component, schools will undertake internal moderation in accordance with the guidelines on moderation for Junior Cycle assessment which will be formally confirmed by the principal;<br /><br />-  The results awarded on every school certificate will be sent to the DES. The DES will monitor the national and school patterns along with the results in the standardised testing of reading, Mathematics and Science. This monitoring will provide further quality assurance and identify any local or national anomalies. A report on overall trends will be published regularly. In the event of an unusual pattern of achievement, the Inspectorate of the DES will be advised, and support and evaluation measures will be provided for the school. </blockquote>In addition, national monitoring of standards will be complemented by continued participation in national and international assessments.  </p></reply>

Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.</p><p>In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. Prospective candidates for assessment are discussed in general terms and agreed by the Principal and assigned psychologist. Parental consent to proceed with the assessment is obtained and a referral document is raised by the school, with input from parents and teachers outlining the child's specific difficulties and education history.</p><p>There are currently 167 psychologists employed within my Department's NEPS service (amounting to some nearly 159 whole-time equivalents when working sharing is factored in) and I attach for the Deputies information a table of the number of psychologists employed in this regard by year since its inception in 1999.</p><p>These psychologists are assigned currently to some 83% of Primary schools (representing 89% of the pupil population) and 93% of Post-Primary Schools (the same proportion of student population).  Therefore some 570 primary and 48 post-primary schools have no NEPS psychologist assigned to them and, as described above receive assessment service from the S.C.P.A.  I can inform the Deputy that an additional 10 new psychologists are currently engaged with the public appointments service with a view to their being recruited to NEPS in the current academic year at which stage, and following a short period of induction, they will be assigned schools.</p><p><bu>No. of Educational Psychologists employed in NEPS by Year. </bu></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th><div><b>No. Psychologists</b></div></th><th><div><b>Whole-Time Equivalent</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div>1999</div></td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>43.0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2000</div></td><td><div>69</div></td><td><div>68.0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2001</div></td><td><div>84</div></td><td><div>82.5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2002</div></td><td><div>118</div></td><td><div>116.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2003</div></td><td><div>123</div></td><td><div>120.4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2004</div></td><td><div>127</div></td><td><div>122.9</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2005</div></td><td><div>118</div></td><td><div>114.0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2006</div></td><td><div>124</div></td><td><div>117.8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>134</div></td><td><div>126.7</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>155</div></td><td><div>148.5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>153</div></td><td><div>146.9</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>165</div></td><td><div>158.9</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>173</div></td><td><div>166.0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>167</div></td><td><div>158.8</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The redeployment of these teachers was completed during the summer. However, some additional surplus also arises in the Autumn as a result of the suppression of teaching posts given to schools on the basis of projected September 2012 enrolments and the required level of actual enrolments not materialising. The mechanism for the redeployment of such surplus permanent teachers in the Autumn can result in a post that was filled initially by a teacher on a fixed-term contract to 26 October is then thereafter filled by the redeployment of a surplus permanent teacher.</p><p>  Boards of Management should make clear to teachers the contractual arrangements in relation to the filling of such posts.  The allocation of all teaching posts is contingent on compliance with redeployment arrangements. This is monitored by the Department. The Department's assessment of compliance with the redeployment arrangements relates firstly to the requirement to notify the vacancy to the panel operator and then the requirement to offer the vacancy to teachers in the following sequence &ndash; firstly to surplus permanent teachers on the main panel, then to teachers on the subsidiary panel and thereafter to teachers on the supplementary panel before filling posts through open recruitment. Where it was found, based on information supplied by schools to the Department, that schools that are seeking to fill posts through open recruitment had not complied fully with the redeployment arrangements such schools are permitted to fill their vacancy only on a fixed-term basis.</p></reply>

Current guidelines (Circular 10/10)  issued by my Department require that public bodies conduct the public procurement function in a way that facilitates and does not place barriers to participation of small and medium enterprises.  As one measure to achieve this, the guidance advises that the sub-dividing of procurement requirements into &#8220;lots&#8221; should be considered by contracting authorities where it would be appropriate and practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</p><p>  This guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:<blockquote>- supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &#8364;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i>   website;<br /><br /> - less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;<br /><br /><br />  - ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;<br /><br /><br />  - sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</blockquote>  In order to further encourage SME participation in public procurement as outlined in Circular 10/10, the National Procurement Service (NPS) recently established a Working Group on Small &amp; Medium Enterprises to respond to public procurement issues arising for SMEs. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association.  The Working Group will develop measures to highlight the scope that contracting authorities have under circular 10/10 to encourage SME participation in public procurement processes.</p><p>  In addition, the National Procurement Service, as part of its education and development remit, also has an active programme to assist SMEs in how to participate effectively in the public service procurement process.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  The next event in this programme will be a major 'Meet the Buyer' event in Kilkenny in November at which it is anticipated more than 400 SMEs will attend.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each Minister as the sanctioning authority for projects to take all the relevant policy decisions about projects in accordance with these guidelines.  The State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002 sets out the types of PPP arrangements that State authorities may enter into.  This includes the type of arrangement described by the Deputy.  </p><p>  The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) provides advice to sanctioning authorities on all capital projects with a value of over 20m euro.  The NDFA will provide financial, insurance and risk analysis advice to State authorities to assist in determining the most appropriate procurement mechanism.  The NDFA also procures projects on behalf of State authorities.  Decisions as to the type of PPP arrangements to be entered into are a matter for each Sanctioning Authority, with advice from the NDFA. </p><p>  The NDFA as a centre of PPP expertise will be responsible for the delivery of the Primary Care PPP programme on behalf of the HSE.  I understand that it is anticipated that any grouped contract will comprise at least 10 centres in order to be of sufficient scale to make them attractive to the PPP market.  However, the precise nature of the composition of any grouped contracts, including the number of centres within any one contract, the scope of facility support services to be provided and the term of the PPP contract are currently being examined.  In line with standard PPP structures, it is expected the Primary Care Centres will remain in the ownership of the HSE throughout the term of the PPP contract, with the PPP companies selected being granted a licence to construct the centres and to provide the required facility support services. </p></reply>

Reducing overall expenditure in 2013 and beyond in line with these targets will be very challenging. In this regard, I held a pre-Budget forum on Friday 12th   October.  This was attended by thirty community and voluntary groups, including Age Action Ireland and Active Retirement Ireland.  I listened carefully to the groups' views and proposals in relation to the forthcoming Budget and will consider all submissions made to me in relation to the Budget.

The role of the IDG is to explore the best possible model for enhancing the provision of school-age child care to assist in meeting the child care needs of the customers of the DSP &ndash; including lone parents.  The model in question will seek to address the child care requirements of children aged between 7 and 12 years (inclusive) and will also address the level of child care provision required during both the school term and the school holidays.</p><p>  Extensive work has been completed by the IDG to quantify the level of school-age child care required to support the relevant social welfare income support recipients, in particular lone parents, for each year up to and including 2015.  An examination has been completed of existing child care schemes and of the capital investments already made by the DCYA in this sector.  The IDG intends to submit proposals on school-age child care to the Government for its consideration in due course.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have also met with some of the lone parent representative groups to discuss a number of issues that are affecting lone parents &ndash; including their initial views in relation to child care.  In addition to this work, I have had the opportunity, with my officials, to examine the Swedish child care system.  The information and experience gained from that examination, will provide valuable input to the on-going work of the IDG.   </p></reply>

I am particularly interested in the childcare system that Sweden has put in place and I very much wanted the opportunity to examine the system to establish what Ireland could learn from that model. </p><p>  The school I visited is a Reggio Emilia-inspired pre-school on the suburbs of Stockholm.  The Reggio Emilia approach is an educational philosophy that is focused on pre-school and primary education.  The approach is based on the principles of respect, responsibility and community through exploration and discovery in a supportive and enriching environment that is centred on the interests of the children and structured around a self-guided curriculum.  The natural development of children is at the centre of its philosophy.  Parental involvement is also central to the philosophy.   </p><p>  The school is very much a central part of the community and allows parents to avail of work and/or educational opportunities while their children are being cared for.  There are many aspects of the Swedish childcare system that are very impressive.  However, a more detailed examination of this and other international systems would be required to establish the most appropriate model for Ireland.</p></reply>

There is a range of complex issues that need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of such a scheme &ndash; the extent of coverage; the rate of payment; possible compensatory mechanisms for employers where appropriate and how a scheme would be enforced and policed.

Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner's certificate.</p><p>  In general, only deaths which occur within the State can be registered.  However, Section 39 of the Act provides for the following exceptions:</p><p>- The death of an Irish citizen on board a foreign ship or a foreign aircraft travelling to or from a port, or an airport, as the case may be, in the State;</p><p>- The death of a person on board an Irish aircraft or an Irish ship;</p><p>- The death of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Permanent Defence Force or of the spouse or specified members of the family of such a member outside the State while the member is serving outside the State as such member.</p><p>  Usually, when an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable.  This certificate, translated, if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and for these reasons alone there is no necessity for the death to be registered in the State. </p><p>  Section 38 of the Act makes provision for the registration of a death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State in certain specific circumstances.  Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if there was not at the time of the death a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or such a system that applied to such a death, or it is not possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death, i.e. a death certificate.  In other words, if the death could not be registered or if a death certificate could not be obtained, the death can be registered here.</p><p>  The number of Irish citizens who are domiciled in Ireland and who die abroad is relatively small in the context of total deaths occurring here in any given year.  My understanding is that the vast majority of these people were travelling abroad for leisure or business purposes.  I am aware that the Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection has recommended amending the current legislation in order to enable deaths of Irish citizens who have died abroad to be registered here. </p><p>  Any broadening of the current provisions will require careful consideration.  It will be appreciated that the number of people who live and die in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship is very large.  This would have implications both for the registration process itself and for the vital statistics relating to deaths which are derived from registered events.  This issue is currently being considered in my Department along with a number of other proposed amendments to the Civil Registration Act (2004) and in this regard it is hoped that legislation will be introduced in 2013.</p></reply>

Carer&rsquo;s allowance section has completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer&rsquo;s allowance. The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project commenced for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs. The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and is being closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives. A noted improvement was achieved in September where claims processed substantially exceeded claim intake.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level. The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 16,000 mortgage interest supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &#8364;51 million for in 2012.</p><p>  The amount of MIS payable is the difference between the actual mortgage interest and the customer&#8217;s contribution to mortgage interest, provided that the difference between the two is a reasonable amount to meet the customer&#8217;s residential needs. Under the rules governing mortgage interest supplement, it is a condition of entitlement that the amount of the mortgage interest payable by the claimant does not exceed what the Department&#8217;s representative considers reasonable to meet his or her residential needs.</p><p>  Departmental guidelines state that in determining what is considered reasonable to meet a customer&#8217;s residential needs regard should be made to the appropriate maximum rent limits applicable to the family composition and location of the residence.  Under the rules governing entitlement to the scheme a person may be entitled to a supplement towards the amount of mortgage <i>interest</i> payable in respect of his or her residence provided that:<blockquote>- the supplementary welfare allowance means test is satisfied<br /><br />- the applicant has at the time of application engaged with their mortgage lender in order to meet their mortgage repayment obligations, and has entered into and complied with an alternative repayment arrangement for a period of not less than 12 months<br /><br />- the loan agreement was entered into at a time when, in the opinion of the Department&#8217;s representative, the person was in a position to meet the repayments <br /><br />- the residence in respect of which the loan is payable, is not offered for sale <br /><br />- only the portion of the loan that relates to the essential purchase, repair or maintenance of the property is taken into account<br /><br />- the applicant is habitually resident in the State <br /><br />- the amount of the mortgage interest payable by the claimant does not exceed such amount as the Department&#8217;s representative considers reasonable to meet his or her residential and other needs<br /><br />- it is reasonable to award a supplement having regard to the amount of any arrears outstanding on the loan. In exceptional circumstances, the Department&#8217;s representative may award a supplement where the amount of mortgage interest payable by a person exceeds such amount as the Department&#8217;s representative considers reasonable to meet his or her residential and other needs.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).</p><p>  Last year I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.</p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.  The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.</p><p>  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Any proposals to ensure that the self-employed are better protected by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.</p><p>  Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

This requirement is based on Government policy and Departmental guidelines and has been the rule since CE commenced in 1994.  At present persons signing for credits or otherwise ineligible for a social welfare payment, do not meet the current eligibility requirements for participation on the CE Scheme.  They may, however, be eligible for participation on other programmes, although they may not qualify for payment of an allowance e.g. F&Aacute;S training courses.

The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was completed for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams.  One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives.  A noted increase in the number of new claims processed was achieved in September, where claims processed substantially exceeded claim intake, and this increase continues into October.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.  The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored.</p></reply>

My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, is responsible for the administration of the student grant scheme which covers the cost of fees and maintenance grant.</p><p>  This Department provides support to job seekers who are seeking to commence a course of education or training under a number of schemes.  Under the technical employment support grant (TESG), training interventions funds can be provided for courses that lead to a qualification of up to and including FETAC level 6 or an equivalent qualification provided it is aligned to the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).  To qualify, a job seeker must be in receipt of certain DSP payments and registered with my Department&rsquo;s Employment Services.  Up to &euro;500 per job seeker can be made available where the required assessment has been undertaken.</p><p>  The technical assistance and training scheme (TATS) is a discretionary fund which provides supports towards certain business start-up expenses for back to work enterprise allowance recipients who are engaging in self-employment projects and have received prior approval from a Department facilitator.  This fund may also support courses of study relevant to their self-employment leading to an award up to and including FETAC level 6 or the equivalent award provided it is aligned to the NFQ.  The job seeker must make a minimum contribution of 25% towards the total cost of any course of study.  TATS funding cannot not be used to fund either full time or part time third level fees (course or registration) including PLC courses.  Payments of up to &euro;1,000 per job seeker are available. </p><p>  The Activation and Family Support Programme (AFSP) provides for funding to enable the development of training and education initiatives, mainly in conjunction with other organisations and agencies, to assist people who are in receipt of social welfare payments to enhance their employability through education, training and personal development opportunities.  Department Facilitators work with social welfare recipients and other agencies and service providers to identify the most appropriate courses for funding.  Only courses up to level 6 on the NFQ are eligible for funding.  AFSP funding cannot not be used to fund either full time or part time third level fees (course or registration) including PLC courses.</p></reply>

To be eligible for carer&rsquo;s allowance you must satisfy certain criteria.  Some of the main conditions are that you must be 18 years of age or over and providing full-time care and attention to a person in need of care who does not normally live in an institution; you must be resident in the State and you must not be engaged in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for more than 15 hours a week.</p><p>  The person being cared for must be over the age of 16 and be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention or aged under 16 and in receipt of a Domiciliary Care Allowance. Domiciliary care allowance ceases when a child reaches the age of 16 but carer&rsquo;s allowance may continue if it is established that child is so incapacitated as to require full-time care.  In such instances, a letter issues from the carer&rsquo;s allowance section to the carer requesting medical information to be submitted for the caree prior to the child turning 16 years of age.  Once this medical information is received, it is sent to one of the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors for assessment.  The carer&rsquo;s allowance remains in payment during the review process until a decision is made.</p><p>  Where payment is stopped as a result of a review, the customer can submit any new information or medical evidence they may wish to have considered and that information will be further examined by a medical assessor.  It will avoid undue delay if a customer being reviewed submits all available and relevant information and evidence at the outset.  In addition, a customer who is not satisfied with a decision may appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p></reply>

These changes are being phased in over time.  For new recipients who made their OFP claim after the 3rd May 2012, the age of the youngest child will be reduced to 7 years of age from 2014.  For all other recipients the age of the youngest child will be reduced to 7 years of age from 2015.  </p><p>  I have acknowledged that the reform of the OFP will require a broad engagement and co-ordinated response from Government.  In that context, discussions have been taking place between the Department of Social Protection (DSP) the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) &ndash; which is the lead Department in relation to child care policy and provision &ndash; and the Department of Education and Skills (DES) with regard to the development of a policy framework around school-age child care and, in the short term, the assessment of the extent of the current provision of such care.</p><p>  An inter-Departmental Group (IDG) on school-age child care, chaired by DSP and comprising of representatives from both the DCYA and DES, has been established and is presently examining the needs and provision of school-age child care in the country.  The role of the IDG is to explore the best possible model for enhancing the provision of school-age child care to assist in meeting the child care needs of the customers of the DSP &ndash; including lone parents.  The model in question will seek to address the child care requirements of children aged between 7 and 12 years (inclusive) and will also address the level of child care provision required during both the school term and the school holidays.</p><p>  Extensive work has been completed by the IDG to quantify the level of school-age child care required to support the relevant social welfare income support recipients, in particular lone parents, for each year up to and including 2015.  An examination has been completed of existing child care schemes and of the capital investments already made by the DCYA in this sector.  The IDG intends to submit proposals on school-age child care to the Government for its consideration in due course.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012. </p><p>  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The &ldquo;top up&rdquo; payments referred to fall into two specific categories. Where a person has an additional income above the rate of supplementary welfare allowance they are, in certain circumstances, allowed to top up their rent as they will still have sufficient income to meet their basic needs after paying their rent. </p><p>  The second type of top up payment can occur where the application to the Department declares a rent lower than that actually being charged by the landlord.  Any instance of false declarations should be reported to the relevant Department representatives who have specific legislative powers to deal with such offences.  There has been no evidence presented to the Department showing widespread or systemic &lsquo;false declarations&rsquo; of rent supplement through the use of illegal top-ups.</p><p>  Analysis shows that for County Kildare, there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients, including rental properties available to single persons. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs.  Officials in my Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement but at this stage I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits. The next review of rent limits will take place before June 2013 and any changes to the limits in County Kildare will be considered as part of this review. </p></reply>

As the Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions. There are approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012. </p><p>  Revised maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  </p><p>  The revised limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review. Approximately 40,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012 indicating that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.   Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.  Officials in my Department continue to review the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement but at this stage I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits. </p></reply>

As a Member State of the European Union, Ireland is bound to apply these regulations in accordance with the objective of the EC Treaty regarding free movement of persons.</p><p>  Before payment is made in respect of children resident in other EU countries it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will impact on any entitlement under the Irish system. Once payment has commenced, as part of the Department&rsquo;s on-going control programme, these customers are required to confirm periodically their continued entitlement to benefit.  Where questions arise in relation to entitlement, or there is a delay in responding to enquiries from the Department, payment is suspended pending investigation.</p><p>  Changes to EU legislation to modify child benefit entitlements in respect of non-resident children requires the agreement of the EU Commission as any proposals for amendments must be tabled by it. I have raised the issue with the Commission and with relevant Ministers from other EU countries, and will continue to do so. The Commission stressed the importance attached to the system of coordinating social security for the role it plays in encouraging and facilitating free movement of people across the Union and indicated extreme reluctance to introduce changes along the lines that have been discussed in this country because they would discriminate against migrant workers and would not be in line with judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area.</p></reply>

IFI has been allocated &euro;28.462 million for the current year.</p><p>  Direct Exchequer funding for IFI was reduced by &euro;2.582 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and there was a further &euro;0.749 million reduction in 2011, which are mainly though not exclusively, attributable to savings arising from the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector.  The increase in allocation for 2012 can be attributed to the additional &euro;3m capital funding towards the rationalisation of IFI&rsquo;s Dublin accommodation with the principal aim of achieving major cost efficiencies over the medium to long term while preserving critical functional capability.  </p></reply>

I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) that in light of requests for extension of the season, it requested the Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) to devise criteria that could be used to extend the angling season.</p><p>  The following guidance was provided by the Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon (SSC) on the criteria that should be evaluated when considering a proposal for an extension to the angling season in a salmon catchment from a scientific perspective.<blockquote>  An angling season should only be extended if the salmon stock has been meeting Conservation Limit (CL) and is likely to continue to meet its CL if an extension is given i.e. provided no more than the harvestable surplus is taken.<br /><br /><br />  Where an extension is being considered, there should be a reasonable sized quota and a reasonable proportion of the surplus remaining after the original season has ended to avoid recruitment over fishing.<br /><br /><br />  An extension could be facilitated on a river with a smaller remaining quota if catch and release was only allowed during the extension period.<br /><br /><br />  Avoiding recruitment over fishing would also be facilitated by having good information on run timing such that the likely proportion of the stock which will return prior to and within the extension period can be evaluated.<br /><br /><br />  It is recommended that the presence of fresh fish prior to or during the extension period can be confirmed by local IFI Inspectors or that this is likely from previous year&#8217;s experience.</blockquote>  In addition, care must also be taken to address the possibility of taking red or coloured (often referred to as unclean or unseasonable) salmon during a period when the salmon angling season is extended after September.  The 1959 Fisheries Act protects &#8216;unseasonable fish&#8217; in Section 176 as follows:    176.&#8212;(1) If any person takes, kills or destroys any unseasonable salmon or trout, such person shall be guilty of an offence (the expression &#8220;<i>unseasonable salmon or trout</i>&#8221; means any salmon or trout which is about to spawn, or which has spawned and has not recovered from spawning;).  </p></reply>

The data collected using this standard approach is comparable with similar data from other rivers nationally.</p><p>  Sampling is generally undertaken at sites throughout each catchment to report on likely salmon bearing habitat.  Sites are selected in riffle/gravel areas, suitable for wading, where there is good access to the river.  Sites are generally selected at more than 1 km distances from each other and an effort is made to include all the tributaries in the catchment.</p><p>  No sites are sampled in the Barrow main channel (navigable section) as it is unsuitable for salmon production and is too deep to sample.  The sampling programme for the Barrow (and all other catchments) is designed to ensure coverage of as many sites as is feasible across the extent of the catchment, within the time frame allocated, based on the methodology outlined.</p><p>The catchment wide survey on the Barrow catchment (85 sites) was carried out in August and September 2012.  This was the fifth CWEF survey of this catchment.  With the exception of 2008, the Barrow survey has been carried out annually since 2007.  </p></reply>

This commitment is set out in the Government&rsquo;s recently-published National Broadband Plan.  In addition to setting out clear targets in relation to speeds, the Plan also sets ambitious deadlines for achieving these plus a range of complementary measures (such as demand stimulation, review of our national spectrum policy, addressing planning barriers clarifying the role of State-owned infrastructure in the delivery of telecommunications services), which will also help to expedite the deployment of the necessary infrastructure to deliver these high-speed services.</p><p>  Preparatory work on undertaking a national mapping exercise has already begun in my Department and this important task can begin in earnest once the current spectrum auction process has been completed by ComReg.  This mapping exercise will enable the Government to make informed decisions about where exactly State intervention will be required to ensure that the investment in next generation broadband services takes place.</p><p>  Given that eircom is a private company, I am not in a position to comment on the upgrading of its various exchanges countrywide.

On 9th   February 2012 I invited further expressions of interest from persons wishing to serve on any of the Boards under the aegis of my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that appointments to State Boards are made in accordance with the relevant governing statute and I am not obliged to make appointments from tendered expressions of interest and have the discretion to do so if I consider it appropriate.</p><p>Since taking office on 9th   March 2011 I have made 35 appointments to the boards of bodies under the aegis of my Department and the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has made 10 appointments.  Details of the 45 appointments are set out below together with details of the remuneration which may be paid in respect of such appointments.  Four of the appointments made have been to the position of Chairperson, two of these appointees have to date appeared before the relevant Joint Oireachtas Committee in line with the Government decision.  The two other appointees will appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee at future dates to be agreed.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the One Person One Salary policy introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides that serving public sector employees are not eligible to receive remuneration in relation to their membership of boards of State bodies.  The Deputy will also be aware that non-public sector board members may choose to voluntarily waive their fees as a matter of personal choice in recognition of the current difficult economic circumstances.  Both of these policy initiatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have been brought to the attention of the bodies under the aegis of my Department.  Consequently, the remuneration details in the table below refer to fees that may be payable and are not indicative of fees actually being received by board members.  The payment of board members&rsquo; expenses is an operational matter for each State body.</p><p>In addition since these appointments were made one of the members of the board of SEAI, Michael Conlon, has resigned.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Body</div></th><th><div>Appointee</div></th><th><div>Date Appointed</div></th><th><div>Fee Band</div></th></tr><tr><td>An Post</td><td>Mr Donal Connell<br />Mr James Wrynn<br />Mr Paul Henry</td><td>14/08/2011<br />15/09/2011<br />15/09/2011</td><td>Category 1<br />Chair: &#8364;31,500<br />Director: &#8364;15,750</td></tr><tr><td>Bord na M&oacute;na<br /></td><td><br />Ms Denise Cronin<br />Mr. John Horgan (Chairperson) <br /><br /><br /><br />Ms Elaine Treacy</td><td>15/09/2011<br />24/04/2012 (as a Director) <br />27/09/2012 (as Chairperson)<br /><br />17/07/2012</td><td>Category 2<br />Chair: &#8364;21,600<br />Director: &#8364;12,600</td></tr><tr><td>EirGrid<br /></td><td>Dr Gary Healy<br />Ms Regina Moran<br />Mr Liam O&#8217;Halloran<br />Ms Bride Rosney<br />Ms Doireann Barry*</td><td>15/09/2011<br />15/09/2011<br />15/09/2011<br />15/09/2011<br />22/12/2011</td><td>Category 2<br />Chair: &#8364;21,600<br />Director: &#8364;12,600</td></tr><tr><td>ESB</td><td>Ms Noreen Wright<br />Mr Seamus Mallon</td><td>28/06/2011<br />03/05/2011</td><td>Category 1<br />Chair: &#8364;31,500<br />Director: &#8364;15,750</td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC)</td><td>Mr Sean Fitzgerald<br />Mr Vincent Caffrey<br />Ms Aoife MacEvilly<br />Mr Aidan Donnelly</td><td>01/06/2011<br />01/06/2011<br />18/07/2012<br />18/07/2012</td><td>Category 2<br />Chair: &#8364;21,600<br />Director: &#8364;12,600</td></tr><tr><td>National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA)</td><td>Ms Aoife MacEvilly</td><td>11/04/2011</td><td>Category 4<br />Chair: &#8364;8,978<br />Director: &#8364;5,985</td></tr><tr><td>TG4<br /><br /></td><td>Mr. Miche&aacute;l Seoighe<br />Ms. Mair&#275;ad N&iacute; Cheoin&iacute;n<br />Mr. Joe Connolly<br />Mr. Des Geraghty<br />Ms. Andr&#275;a N&iacute; &#274;alaithe<br />Ms Mairead Nic Suibhne<br />Ms. Michelle N&iacute; Chr&oacute;in&iacute;n<br />Si&uacute;n N&iacute; Raghallaigh (Chairperson)</td><td>17/04/2012<br />17/04/2012<br /><br />17/04/2012<br />17/04/2012<br />17/04/2012<br /><br />17/04/2012<br /><br />17/04/2012<br /><br />17/04/2012</td><td>Category 2<br />Chair: &#8364;21,600<br />Director: &#8364;12,600</td></tr><tr><td>Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)<br /><br /></td><td>Ms Julie O&#8217;Neill<br />Mr. Edgar Morgenroth<br />Mr. Michael Conlon<br /><br /><br />Ms. Anne Farrell<br />Mr. Declan Waugh<br />Ms. Michelle Green<br />Mr. Brian Carroll<br />Mr. Brendan Halligan (Chairperson) </td><td>15/09/2011<br />24/04/2012<br /><br />15/09/2011 (but resigned on 21/08/2012)<br />24/04/2012<br />29/05/2012<br />29/05/2012<br />26/06/2012<br />01/10/2012 (re-appointed)</td><td>Category 3<br />Chair: &#8364;11,970<br />Director: &#8364;7,695</td></tr><tr><td>Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA)</td><td>Mr. Paul Holden<br />Mr. Seamus Ratigan</td><td>29/05/2012<br />29/05/2012</td><td>Category 3<br />Chair: &#8364;11,970<br />Director: &#8364;7,695</td></tr><tr><td>Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi)<br /><br /><br /></td><td>Mr. Ronan O&#8217;Reilly (Chairperson) <br />Ms. Anne Butler <br />Mr. Robin Simpson<br />Dr. Enda Howley<br />Dr. Denis Keliher<br />Ms. Marion Coy<br />Mr. Justin Gleeson<br />Ms Sandra Ryan  <br />Mr. Padraic Jordan<br />Mr. Oliver Hickey </td><td>22/05/2012<br /><br />22/05/2012<br />22/05/2012<br />22/05/2012<br />22/05/2012<br />22/05/2012<br />22/05/2012<br />22/05/2012<br />22/05/2012<br />19/06/2012</td><td>Category 3<br />Chair: &#8364;11,970<br />Director: &#8364;7,695</td></tr></table></p><p>*No fee applicable</p></reply>

Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive affordable basic broadband provision.  The Scheme was designed to give commercial operators the opportunity to serve applicants on commercial terms in the first instance.  Where a commercial connection could not be made the Scheme was designed to provide some subsidy towards the initial capital cost of providing a connection to an applicant&#8217;s premises.  The provision of grants was not part of the design of the Scheme.</p><p>  In total, there were 2011 applications from persons who consented to receive offers of service from Internet Service Providers participating in the Scheme. Offers of service were made to all of these applicants during the period from April to the end of July this year.  The response to date by industry suggests that virtually all eligible applicants under the Scheme are capable of obtaining a broadband service from a supplier using one of the available technology platforms i.e. DSL, fixed or mobile wireless, cable or satellite.  Obviously, where a commercial service is shown to be available, the State cannot intervene with a subvention for alternative services as to do so would be a breach of State Aid rules.</p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&#8217;s &#8220;Digital Agenda for Europe&#8221; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&#8217;s National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &#8211; specifically:<blockquote>70Mbps &#8211; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;<br /><br />At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and<br /><br />A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</blockquote>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Ballynacargy, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

My Department is currently examining the latest projections for 2012 with a view to providing a revised estimate of evasion.  While this work has yet to be completed, it is my understanding, however, that it is unlikely to show any decrease in what is already an unacceptably high level of TV licence evasion.  In tackling this problem, every effort is made by An Post to bring evaders into the licensed pool and a considerable amount of its time and resources are spent in dealing with evasion.</p><p>  As a first step, An Post concentrate their efforts on getting people to buy the licence when due.  A series of reminder notices are sent out urging people to pay their TV Licence.  Payment has been made easier with the introduction over the last couple of years of a dedicated website (www.tvlicence.ie), 24 hour automated call centre (1890-228528) and the option to pay by direct debit instalments.  In addition, the older traditional methods of payment at the counter in a post office and with the TV licence stamps remain available.</p><p>  Every effort is taken to identify unlicensed premises, from people whose licence has lapsed to people who have moved premises.  This is done by a number of measures including additional reminders, inspector visits and eventually by court summons.  The general public is currently being informed through advertisement that regardless of the digital switchover on October 24th   2012, there is a legal obligation to hold a TV licence.  The digital switchover does not change this statutory fact.</p></reply>

The Ocean Energy Development Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland was specifically established to advance the sector and has been administering grants through a prototype development fund, carrying out a strategic environmental assessment on our potential for ocean energy development, developing a grid connected wave test site off Annagh Head, County Mayo and working with other State bodies to advance the sector.  Work has been ongoing by the Marine Institute in the ocean energy area for many years, including through the development of the SmartBay project and the Galway Bay wave test site.  The INFOMAR project being taken forward by the Geological Survey of Ireland is also collecting valuable data that assists the sector.</p><p>  Most universities in Ireland have researchers involved in the ocean energy area, including Galway, Maynooth and Dublin.  The Coastal and Marine Research Centre in University College Cork has long had researchers engaged in ocean area along with the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre in UCC, which has been supporting the sector&rsquo;s development, including through protocols for technology testing and scaling and with its wave tank facility, which was recently upgraded.  The strands of research in the Cork area will be brought together in a new campus in Ringaskiddy (currently under construction) through the iMERC project, which aims to unlock our maritime and energy potential and promote Ireland as a world-renowned research and development location, with an initial focus on ocean energy.</p><p>  There are no plans at present to introduce an ocean energy competition similar to the Saltire Prize mentioned, given the budgetary constraints within which we are operating.  </p></reply>

The licence, which is a follow-on authorisation to Licensing Option 08/2, is for a six year period with an obligation to drill an exploration well by August 2014.  The licensees have not as yet submitted their detailed proposals for drilling to my Department for approval.</p><p>  I am aware that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government recently granted the company a foreshore licence in respect of works related to the drilling of a well on the acreage.  A foreshore licence is required as the location for the exploration well is within the twelve nautical miles foreshore area.</p><p>  In the event that the exploration activity was successful and resulted in a commercial discovery, profits would be subject to a tax rate of between 25% and 40% depending on the profitability of the field.  Ireland&rsquo;s tax rate for oil and gas production is similar to EU Member States such as France 34.4%, Portugal 27.5% and Spain 30%, who, like Ireland, have limited petroleum production and with whom we compete for investment.  Ireland&rsquo;s tax rate is lower than that of the UK which has a tax rate of 62%, which reflects the fact that the UK has had significant success as a petroleum producer.</p><p>  In the event of a commercial discovery, petroleum exploration capital expenditures incurred in Ireland in the 25-year period prior to the commencement of field production would be 100% deductible against corporation tax at the start of production.  This includes capital expenditure on exploration activities outside the lease production area but excludes expenditure incurred in other countries.</p></reply>

However, set closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers, including slurry, are a requirement of the Nitrates Directive and mandatory in every Member State. The purpose of closed periods is to protect ground and surface water bodies, including drinking water sources, by prohibiting the application of fertilisers when such application poses an unacceptable risk to water courses. The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission at the time.</p><p>  Good agricultural practice involves the application of fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water. The application of fertilisers in the months of November and December is not considered good farming practice and this has been the case long before the Nitrates Regulations came into force in Ireland.  Farmers have until 31 October to spread organic manures in accordance with the extension I announced in September. The situation on the ground continues to be monitored closely.</p></reply>

A full and detailed assessment of all projects is essential; currently, the LEADER activities are co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 85% and, accordingly, come within the remit of a strict regulatory regime which requires that each project must be compliant before any funding is awarded by the LEADER companies.</p><p>  My Department is in the process of assessing this project and a decision will shortly be made on the matter. North Tipperary LEADER Partnership will be notified of the outcome and will in turn notify the project promoter. </p></reply>

In 2011, I provided a total of &euro;5.56m in funding, while to date in 2012, a further &euro;1.60m from the Environment Fund has been provided in support of the costs arising in supporting the work of the Agency at this facility. The funding is supporting a detailed site investigation at the facility.  Following completion in 2013 of the investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency, recommended options for the full remediation of the facility will be carefully considered. It is not possible, at this point, to quantify precisely the further funding requirements that will arise, as the costs involved will depend on the action chosen including, inter alia, the approach to remediation required and the results of any tendering process.</p></reply>

This initiative was intended to remedy those estates where there were public safety issues for residents and members of the public but where the responsible party could not be pursued in the short term.</p><p>  Under the initiative unfinished housing developments fall within four categories:   <blockquote>-     Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; <br /><br /><br />  -  Category two, where a receiver has been appointed; <br /><br /><br />  - Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and <br /><br />-  Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.   </blockquote>  A total funding allocation of &#8364;5 million was made available by my Department for these works and local authorities submitted claims where estates fell into category 4 under the scheme.  The types of works that have been approved to date include fencing off unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites beyond those carried out during the normal taking in charge process.</p><p>  Carlow County Council applied for funding in respect of 10 such developments and funding of &#8364;210,228 was approved by my Department.  To date &#8364;105,114 has been drawn down with the remaining balance due to be paid on receipt of claims.  Details in respect of unfinished housing developments in the Carlow area can be found in the National Housing Development Survey 2011, which may be accessed on my Department&#8217;s website, </p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.   </p><p>  Householders seeking to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme must meet the following criteria: <blockquote>-   their mortgage has to have been deemed unsustainable under a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process as provided for under the Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears;   <br /><br />-   they are agree able to a voluntary repossession of their home;   <br /><br />-   they are eligible for social housing support; and   <br /><br />-   they do not have significant positive equity in the property.  </blockquote>  Additionally applicants must own the property, and it must have a current market value of less than &#8364;220,000 in the Dublin area or less than &#8364;180,000 in the rest of the country.  </p><p>  The property must be in good condition, in a suitable location and must suit the household&#8217;s needs. In addition applicants must not own any other property or have assets in excess of &#8364;20,000 and the net household annual income must not exceed a maximum of &#8364;35,000, depending on its location.  The scheme operates on a collaborative basis between the borrower, lender and the approved housing body acquiring the property. It is anticipated that all lending institutions will participate in the scheme.</p></reply>

The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils. Instalment payments were available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way had to register their details with the LGMA before 1 March, 2012. This deadline was necessary in order to meet banking requirements for direct debit arrangements.  While there is no provision relating to ability to pay included in the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011, the Act does place collection of the charge under the care and management of local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

Detailed planning and identification of early actions for the amalgamation of the local authorities, including analysis of income, expenditure, assets, liabilities, staff (numbers/grades and identification of any surpluses), services, procedures and other relevant matters in the two authorities, and identification of requirements for organisational rationalisation and integration and such other preparatory, transitional, procedural or administrative measures as may be necessary in relation to the existing authorities or their functions, in preparation for the establishment of the unified authority and the effective performance of its functions.   <br /><br />2.  Establishment of effective co-ordination/project management arrangements to oversee and deliver successfully the restructuring process.   <br /><br />3.  Rationalisation of the provision of services (not already subject to joint arrangements) in preparation for merger of the authorities, including consolidation of particular services and establishment of joint arrangements, as appropriate, in respective authorities, with a view to ensuring orderly transition to the unified authority.   <br /><br />4.  Organisational rationalisation and integration as soon as possible, including the early establishment of a joint management team and deployment of staff within the two authorities in line with the integration/consolidation of services; in particular, integration of corporate functions and any other necessary rationalisation.   <br /><br />5.  Action necessary to ensure that cost reductions and efficiencies are maximised and arrangements to measure and monitor their achievement, having regard to the potential savings <font color="#0D0D0D">quantified in the report of the Waterford Local Government Committee of &#8364;5.14m to &#8364;8.95m</font><font color="#0D0D0D">,</font> including savings necessary to ensure that the level of the commercial rate in the County is reduced to the current City level following the establishment of the unitary authority, <font color="#0D0D0D">and any further potential savings.</font><br /><br /><font color="#0D0D0D">6.  Arrangements to support continued effective performance </font>of functions by the elected councils of the two authorities, service to the councils by management and staff in the context of organisational changes, and arrangements to prepare for the effective operation of the unified council, including such matters as committees, procedures and representation on other bodies.  <font color="#0D0D0D"> </font><br /><br /><br />  7.

Measures to ensure adequate balance between the two authorities in the reorganisation process and in their management generally prior to establishment of the unified authority.   <br /><br />9.  Action to achieve alignment and convergence between the objectives and policies of the two authorities as part of the transition towards a unitary authority in 2014 in the context of the overall development of the Waterford gateway.   <br /><br />10.  Arrangements to merge relevant bodies linked with or related to local government, such as Joint Policing Committees and County and City Enterprise Boards <font color="#0D0D0D">/Local Enterprise Offices, and relevant measures to ensure consistency with act</font> ions to align local government and local/community development in line with overall policy in that regard.   <br /><br /><br />  11.  Identification of measures to maximise the capacity of local government to contribute to the economic development of Waterford and its wider hinterland/region and, in particular, to enhance the role of Waterford City as a generator of growth and a strong and dynamic focus for development of the wider region. <br /><br />12.  Proposals on ways to ensure that the status, identity, character, and heritage of <font color="#0D0D0D">the city of Waterford are maintained and enhanced within the unified authority</font><font color="#0D0D0D">,</font><font color="#0D0D0D">with an appropriate metropolitan district comprising the wider city and hinterland area in the eastern part of the county,</font><font color="#0D0D0D">which will be determined on the basis of a statutory review of local electoral areas</font><font color="#0D0D0D">in the context of new sub-county local government arrangements, while</font><font color="#0D0D0D">having regard to the respective urban and rural considerations.</font><font color="#FF0000"> </font><br /><br />13.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters , including the most appropriate method of valuation.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. </p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system. A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system. Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.</p><p>  A property-based tax such as rates has a distinct advantage over any tax based on profits or incomes as it is generally found to be easy to collect and difficult to evade. A system having regard to economic factors on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base. Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate.</p></reply>

The Government has further decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent subsidiary of the Bord G&aacute;is Group.  The skills within the Bord G&aacute;is Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation and ensure its successful establishment and operation.</p><p>  In the initial phase, Irish Water will work largely through service level agreements with local authorities.  These arrangements will not end until 2017 at the earliest.  This will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against the loss of local expertise.  It will also mean that the majority of staff will remain in the direct employment of local authorities for a considerable period.  There will be detailed engagement with Staff and Trade Unions in the rollout of the proposed changes.  Structures have been put in place to facilitate this engagement.  There will be also be some new functions associated with changes to the organisational delivery and funding model.  Bord G&aacute;is will be responsible for obtaining the necessary expertise to fill these roles.</p></reply>

In the present economic circumstances, it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers.  They have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases.  In March 2010, my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p><p>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct, which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt, my Department issued updated guidance in July 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case.  This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent.  Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices.  The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.  I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to help resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers.</p><p>  In relation to the Shared Ownership Scheme specifically, the rent charged on the local authority&rsquo;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates.  Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  That review is now under way and is expected to conclude later in the year.  Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review.</p></reply>

In terms of the delivery of social housing, the Government&#8217;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&#8217;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</p></reply>

By international standards, the revenue base of local authorities in Ireland is relatively narrow, and local authorities here are disproportionately dependent on central Government funding. The introduction of the non-principal private residence and household charges represent important steps in changing how local government is financed, and are the first dedicated new sources of funding for local authorities in some years. The revenues from the Household Charge support the provision of the vital services provided by local authorities.</p><p>  Internationally, local services are administered by local authorities and financed by local service charges. In Ireland, local authorities are responsible for, among other services, fire and emergency services, maintenance and cleaning of streets, street lighting, planning and development services, public parks, libraries, open spaces and leisure facilities.  The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the Household Charge is paid into the Local Government Fund. Money is disbursed back to local authorities in general-purpose grants. It is considered that this approach is preferable to allowing local authorities directly retain all moneys collected from the Household Charge in their areas, as it makes it possible to equalise distribution, ensuring that those local authorities with lower populations than others do not suffer unduly as a result.</p><p>  A more effective, sustainable broadening of the revenue base for local government will be achieved by the introduction of the local property tax. In addition, as noted in the Action Plan for Effective Local Government, <i>Putting People First</i>, if local elected members have relatively little responsibility for raising revenue, their rigorousness in prioritising its allocation, overseeing its efficient use and stewardship, and oversight in relation to the performance and management of local authority operations generally, is likely to be diminished.</p><p>  An independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable local property tax to replace the Household Charge. The Group submitted its report to me and proposals will be brought to Government as soon as possible.  It would not be appropriate to comment on the content of the Expert Group&#8217;s report at this point, pending Government&#8217;s consideration of the report and the associated issues. It will then be a matter for the Government to decide on the exact details of implementation, including considerations related to the impact of the local property tax on the general funding of local authorities, taking into account the modalities involved.</p></reply>

The comprehensive report contains twenty four inter-related recommendations which are well researched and underpinned by a broad consultation process. The report provides a framework to make progress towards quickly providing solutions for homeowners and that is now my focus. The Pyrite Panel included a detailed Implementation Plan in its report identifying the bodies with primary responsibility for implementation of the various recommendations. I will be working with those bodies identified in the Implementation Plan to achieve progress as quickly as possible.   </p><p>  A number of the recommendations in the report pointed to the need for constructive engagement by stakeholders to provide solutions for affected homeowners. Following receipt of the report in June I requested the key stakeholders to urgently consider the relevant recommendations in the report and respond to me with their proposals for an industry led solution by the end of September. I have now received responses from all stakeholders and, while they do not include any definitive proposals that would provide a voluntary solution for homeowners, they do provide varying levels of detail as to how the pyrite problem may be resolved and some have offered to actively participate and engage in any structure that might now be established to progress the issue. </p><p>  I have made it abundantly clear that, in the absence of credible proposals from the stakeholders, I would impose a solution along the lines recommended in the pyrite report in relation to the establishment of a resolution board funded by a mandatory levy on industry. I have now asked my Department to finalise arrangements and terms of reference for the establishment of the Resolution Board as quickly as possible and to engage with the relevant stakeholders in finalising these details. This will give a final opportunity for all those directly or indirectly involved to play a key role in the remediation programme and to contribute to the cost of its resolution. However, if this is not the case I will ask Government to sanction the necessary steps to impose the type of levy as recommended in the pyrite report and in that way to provide finance for the resolution. </p><p>  Work is also progressing on the implementation of a number of other recommendations in the report. I have asked the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) to develop a testing and categorisation protocol to facilitate the categorisation of dwellings and a method statement for remediation work and I understand that this work is progressing. Recommendations in relation to the development of a mandatory certification system for buildings and a registration process for builders are currently being progressed under the Building Control Reform programme. </p><p>  The Pyrite Panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with stakeholder consultation, to establish facts in relation to the potential exposure to pyrite problems. The information was gathered from a number of sources and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity. Seventy four estates with 12,250 ground floor dwellings were identified to the Pyrite Panel. Of these dwellings, the Panel understands that approximately 850 dwellings currently have a claim with a guarantee provider and a further 1,100 dwellings have already been remediated or are in the process of being remediated, leaving the remaining 10,300 ground floor dwellings as the estimated future potential exposure to pyrite. However, it should be noted that in the case of 23 estates (included in the figure of 74 above), with 3,250 ground floor dwellings, there are no claims with structural warranty companies or no other evidence to support the view that they may have pyrite problems. Those figures represent the position as of March 2012 and, taking cognisance of the methodology used to conduct the study and the rate of presentation in Ireland to date, I am reasonably confident that the figures given represent the extent of potential future exposure to pyrite.  The typical cost of remediation for an average house, as quoted to the Panel by those who had undertaken a significant amount of this work, is approximately &euro;45,000.   </p><p>  The Pyrite Panel recommended the categorisation of dwellings by testing to determine appropriate approaches to remediation. It further recommended that only dwellings categorised as red, where there is significant damage due to pyritic heave, should be remediated immediately, dwellings with no significant pyrite damage to be monitored and only remediated if they exhibit pyrite damage. The Panel considered that it would be unreasonable to remediate dwellings which were not exhibiting pyritic damage. I believe this is a sensible and practical approach to prioritise the remediation of pyrite damaged dwellings.</p><p>  The costs of remediating pyrite damaged dwellings must fall to those stakeholders who are deemed to be responsible for the pyrite problem and who are so identified in the pyrite report. I will do what is necessary to ensure that effective solutions are provided for affected homeowners as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme. The current Programme, which runs to the end of 2013, provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &#8364;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure. This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation. The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.</p><p>  The development of the programme followed a comprehensive review of investment requirements initiated in 2009 involving an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services by each water services authority and taking account of reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality and an assessment by Forf&aacute;s of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans.  In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs. There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment.</p><p>  In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the <i>Programme for Government</i> provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure. The Department is currently finalising work on the implementation strategy for the establishment of Irish Water. This strategy will take account of the need to ensure that this critical public service is delivered efficiently during the transition and that there is no loss of momentum in the delivery of key projects.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-23a.1111.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102300058#WRU04300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 463, 495 and 517 together.</p><p>  The Private Security Authority, an independent agency under the remit of my Department, is the regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry in the State.  The Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) sets out the activities in the private security industry which are, or will be, subject to licensing.  One of the security services prescribed in the primary legislation is that of 'installers of security equipment' which includes services such as intruder alarms, access control, and CCTV.  </p><p>  The Authority has adopted a phased approach to the licensing of the industry and the licensing of installers of intruder alarms systems commenced in August 2006.   More recently, in May 2012, new Regulations were introduced to extend the Authority's licensing remit to include contractors installing CCTV and access control systems.  Since 1st October 2012, all such contractors require a licence from the PSA and this completes the Authority's licensing of contractors in the electronic security sector. I am informed by the Authority that the extension of licensing to these sectors had been in preparation for a considerable time and involved two public consultation stages which were notified to industry stakeholders including bodies representing electrical contractors.</p><p>  Contractors such as those in the access control and CCTV sectors are required to pay a licence fee to the Authority.  I am informed by the Authority that the current fee, which is for a two year licence, was set by the Authority in 2005 and has not been increased since that time.  Furthermore, the Authority has informed me that existing licence holders in the alarm installation sector can, subject to meeting the required standard, add the cctv/access control element to their existing licence at no extra cost.</p><p>  The provision of a regulatory environment understandably has cost implications for the industry but the public and the industry itself both benefit from regulation and it is in line with Government policy that industry should fund such regulation.  The Authority has made every effort to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum and has also introduced an instalment payment option to assist contractors with paying for their licence.  The PSA's licence fee structure is monitored by the Authority on a regular basis and I am advised that the Board of the Authority is, in fact, currently reviewing the licence fee structure.  </p><p>  In order to obtain a licence contractors are required to meet standards specified by the Authority.  The standard required for the access control sector is SR 40:2005 - an Irish Standard Recommendation for electronic security services.  For CCTV, both the SR 40 standard and PSA 2006:12 are required, the latter being the Authority's requirements for CCTV installation. Compliance with the standards is certified by auditing bodies. These auditing bodies are commercial entities and it up to contractors to choose the auditing body that best meets their requirements.</p><p>  Since licensing commenced on the 1 October, the Authority has issued 285 access control licences and 297 CCTV licences.  A further 60 applications for licences in these sectors are currently being processed.  The Authority expects to continue to receive applications over the coming weeks as it commences compliance work in the two new sectors.  The Authority&rsquo;s aim is to ensure that all those who require a licence meet the statutory requirements of the Private Security Services Acts.  The introduction of regulation to a previously unregulated industry will always present challenges for both the regulator and the industry.  Since its establishment the Authority has brought about a fundamental change in the industry through a standards based licensing system. </p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, this co-operation was clearly demonstrated by the involvement of these agencies in Operation Pangea V.  This Interpol led Operation involved an international week of law enforcement action, which was fully supported by electronic payment processor companies, in targeting the online sale of counterfeit and illegal medicines. </p><p>  Of course the Government will continue to fully support our law enforcement agencies in their efforts in this area. The illicit trade in prescription drugs has already given rise to a review of our legislative provisions governing the trade in prescription drugs.  I have been liaising closely on this matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Health, who have the primary legislative responsibility in this area. This review will result in a tightening of the controls on the supply and use of these drugs, as deemed necessary, bearing in mind the need to maintain their legitimate use as appropriate.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Health authorities that the Irish Medicines Board is satisfied that the banks, credit card companies and financial institutions continue to co-operate with its investigations as is already provided for under the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1995 - 2006.   In the circumstances I have no current proposals of the nature outlined by the Deputy. </p></reply>

The High Court Working Group Report on Periodic Payments recommended in October 2011 that legislation be enacted to empower the courts, as an alternative to lump sum awards, to make consensual and non-consensual periodic payments to compensate injured victims in cases of catastrophic injury where long term permanent care and treatment will be required.  The Working Group also recommended that periodic payment orders should only be made where the court is satisfied that continuity of payment under the periodic payments order is reasonably secure.</p><p>  The successful operation of a statutory scheme for periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure.  In this regard the Working Group recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate.  Alternatively it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed.  The NTMA has concluded an actuarial review on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security of payment principle.  The NTMA report is being considered in consultation with the Minister for Finance with a view to the development of legislative proposals.</p></reply>

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Kildare Garda Division on 30 September 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 319 Garda&iacute;, 24 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians.  The personnel strength of each Garda Station referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 2012 and on 31 December 2010 was as set out in the table hereunder.</p><p>With regard to the allocation of Garda vehicles, this is a matter in the first instance for the Garda Commissioner. In turn, at Garda Divisional level, the allocation of Garda vehicles is a matter for the Chief Superintendent who may make and revise arrangements for the deployment of vehicles throughout the Division in response to policing demands.  This flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is crucial to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.  As a consequence, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not practicable to provide details of permanent allocations of Garda vehicles.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as at 17th October 2012,  there were 34 Garda Cars allocated to the Kildare Garda Division, compared with 39 allocated in 2010.</p><p><table><tr><th>Station</th><th><div>Strength<br />30/09/12</div></th><th><div>Strength<br />31/12/10</div></th><th>Opening Hours - 2010 and 2012</th></tr><tr><td>Monasterevin</td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td>10am -1pm  Mon -Sun</td></tr><tr><td>Robertstown</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td>10am -1pm  Mon -Sun</td></tr><tr><td>Kilcullen</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td>10am -1pm  Mon -Sun</td></tr><tr><td>Ballitore</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td>7pm - 9pm Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat Closed Sunday</td></tr><tr><td>Athy</td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>29</div></td><td>9am-10pm Mon-Sun</td></tr><tr><td>Rathangan</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td>10am -1pm  Mon -Sun</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare Town</td><td><div>27</div></td><td><div>33</div></td><td>24hr</td></tr><tr><td>Castledermot</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td>10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm Mon - Sun</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymore Eustace</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td>2pm-4pm Mon - Sat Closed Sunday</td></tr></table></p><p>*All opening hours are subject to manpower availability</p></reply>

In 2010, 22 cases were successful, 89 were unsuccessful and 28 were settled. The comparable figures for 2011 were 14, 25 and 37 while the figures to end June 2012 were 6, 6 and 15 respectively.  For the sake of completeness, the Deputy might wish to note that some 1,048 judicial reviews involving the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are pending in the High Court.  More than 600 of those cases are backed up behind one case which was the subject of a referral for a preliminary ruling by the High Court to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  In the case concerned, the High Court delivered its judgment in the State's favour in February 2011.  While this was followed last month by an opinion by Advocate General Bot which is supportive of the State's position in the case, a final ruling by the Court of Justice is awaited.</p></reply>

These undertakings complement those structural reforms in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition relating to the legal professions and legal costs, namely, to establish an independent regulator for the legal professions and implement the recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group, and to implement the outstanding Competition Authority recommendations to reduce legal costs.</p><p>  Effect is being given to these structural reform commitments in the form of the Legal Services Bill 2011 which was published, in keeping with the relevant time-line under the Troika Programme, for the end of Quarter 3 of 2011. As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill, which remains a priority under the Government Legislation Programme, completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in February and is awaiting Committee Stage.</p><p>  I have made comprehensive statements on the Bill and its continuing development both at the Annual Conference of the Law Society on the 14th of April and at the conference hosted by my Department on <i>Regulatory Reform for a 21st Century Legal Profession</i>  which took place on 6th July. The full text of these statements is available on the Department website, www.justice.ie, for ease of reference. I continue to receive submissions in relation to the Bill from various stakeholders and these are being considered as part of the ongoing deliberative process in preparation for Committee Stage.</p><p>  In light of this continuing work, I am confident that the Bill, when enacted, will better balance the interests of consumers of legal services and those of legal practitioners who provide them while modernising the legal costs regime in a way conducive to greater scrutiny and competitiveness. Substantial, positive progress has been made towards achieving the desired and important balance between the independence of the legal professions and the Government&#8217;s stated policy objective of independent regulation. I have made known the intended scope of the amendments to the Bill that will place the new regulatory and disciplinary architecture for the two legal professions beyond any undue interference by Minister or Government. This effectively lays to rest those concerns about impinging on the independence of the legal professions that had been initially voiced in relation to the Bill and its motivation. </p><p>  As the Bill approaches Committee Stage it has reached a point where it is set to provide for an independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority, an independent complaints framework and an independent Legal Practitioners&#8217; Disciplinary Tribunal. These are being buttressed by the functions and powers of a modernised Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, with the support of transparent Legal Costs Principles and procedures. The Bill will also open the legal services sector to the future and its new business models and technologies in a way that will benefit the legal professions as much as it will enhance the position of their clients.  </p><p>  Work on the details of the proposed amendments to the Bill is, therefore, ongoing at my Department including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and the EU/IMF/ECB Troika. As I have previously stated, the relevant amendments will be made available in advance of Committee Stage along with the relevant Regulatory Impact Analysis. It remains my objective, notwithstanding the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments - notably the Personal Insolvency Bill which continues to occupy Members of both Houses - that Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill should commence as soon as possible, preferably before the end of this year.</p></reply>

It will also be appointed independently and, as I have previously mentioned, I will be introducing amendments at Committee Stage to strengthen these independence aspects. At the same time, the Regulatory Authority will be subject to an array of modern governance, accountability and reporting provisions. These will make its outputs, and those of its attendant bodies, open to public and parliamentary scrutiny and assessment. All of these measures are intended to meet, in as transparent a way as possible, the stated objectives of the Programme for Government to  &ldquo;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&rdquo; and to meet the relevant structural reform objectives of the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Programme. </p><p>  The new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and its attendant bodies will, therefore, have the structures, functions and powers consistent with an effective, independent and accountable regulatory body and will operate under the standards of transparency, good governance and audit applicable under international best practice to public bodies. This will ensure that the new regulatory regime and its outcomes are accountable not just at the time of establishment but on an ongoing basis into the future. While it is not for me to predetermine the business and performance management decisions of such an independent regulatory body, I would like to set out some of the key provisions of relevance to measuring the success of the new regulatory regime that are to be found in the Legal Services Regulation Bill.</p><p>  The new Legal Services Regulatory Authority to be established under the Bill will be required to prepare three-yearly strategic plans which will set out the Authority's key objectives and related strategies, including its use of resources, which will, inter alia, be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The Authority will report annually to the Minister for Justice and Equality and to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the performance of its functions during each relevant year. The Authority will present audited financial reports to the Minister and to the Comptroller and Auditor General and its accounts will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Chief Executive of the Authority can be required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and/or before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. In addition, the Authority will be required to report annually on the admission policies of the legal professions and on other specified matters including education and training. It will promote public awareness and disseminate information to the public in respect of legal services, including the cost of such services. The new Authority will undertake research and will assist the Government in coordinating and developing policy in respect of the provision of legal services by legal practitioners.  </p><p>  In relation to the new independent complaints structure - which will apply under the Bill to both barristers and solicitors for the first time - it is intended that the Authority will publish, at regular intervals, information on complaints received and this is an area I intend to address further at Committee Stage. Such information is expected to include the general nature of the complaints, the number of them referred to the Complaints Committee and the outcome of those investigated. The Authority will also publish information on the findings of the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal and of the High Court where the Tribunal's findings are appealed. This information will include the determination of the Tribunal or the Court, the nature of the misconduct, the sanction imposed and the name of the legal practitioner concerned. </p><p>  The Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator (which is to be the modernised equivalent of the existing Office of the Taxing-Master) will be required to maintain a register of legal costs determinations which will include the outcome and reasons for the relevant decisions. Similarly, the Adjudicator is being empowered to produce Legal Costs Guidelines for the information of those involved in assessing costs, legal practitioners and the general public. For the first time in legislation, Legal Costs Principles are set out in the Bill against which the reasonableness of legal costs can be assessed. The Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator will produce three-yearly strategic plans to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas augmented by annual business plans and annual reports that will also be laid before the Houses. </p><p>  The alternative business models for the provision of legal services which are provided for under the Legal Services Regulation Bill and other possible innovations such as the unification of the solicitor and barrister professions are supported by respective public consultation processes which will produce reports and recommendations as set out in the Bill. These outputs will, in keeping with the other transparency provisions of the Bill, be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 30 days of receipt by the Minister. The roll-out of such new legal business models will be regulated by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority and fall within its strategic planning and annual reporting obligations including those relating to the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p><p>  While not exhaustive, the above outline of the accountability and reporting requirements governing the new regulatory regime for legal costs and services under the Legal Services Regulation Bill belies a substantial framework with new and more appropriate levels of scrutiny at the administrative, executive and parliamentary levels. In my view, the Bill's transparency and accountability provisions put the main areas of legal service provision and regulation in plain sight - in many instances for the first time - and provide a regulatory regime that is more responsive to the profound changes taking place in the legal services sector around the world. This augurs a move towards more principles-based or outcomes-focussed regulation that will, by its nature, be more amenable to measurement and examination while maintaining high standards in legal services. I have no doubt that this new regulatory approach can better meet the needs of the legal professions, consumers of legal services and the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority in facing the challenges of the years ahead while providing much needed support to the process of national recovery.</p></reply>

Both systems are under the control of the Property Registration Authority.  Where title or ownership is registered in the Land Registry, the legal ownership is entered on folios which form the registers maintained in the Land Registry. Where title is registered in the Land Registry it is referred to as "registered property" and is open to public inspection.</p><p>  The Registry of Deeds provides a system of recording the existence of deeds and conveyances affecting unregistered property (i.e. property which has never been registered in the Land Registry). The effect of registration of a Deed in the Registry of Deeds is generally to govern priorities between documents dealing with the same piece of land.</p><p>  I am advised by the Property Registration Authority that the information sought by the Deputy is not available. The Land Registry registers the ownership of legal estates and interests. The register of title maintained by the Authority does not distinguish between residential and commercial properties. Under Section 92(1) of the Registration of Title Act 1964, no notice of a trust may be entered on the Register. Therefore, property held under a trust is not readily identifiable as such from the folios of the Register.</p><p>  The address of any company registered on the folios of the Land Register is the address of the company in the State for the purpose of the service of notices under the provisions of Section 106 of the Registration of Title Act 1964. Therefore, an inspection of the registers of ownership will not reveal whether a company was incorporated within or outside of the State.</p></reply>

The mother applied for asylum on 4th March, 2008. A separate asylum application was lodged on behalf of her eldest child on 13th May, 2008. Their respective asylum claims were refused following the consideration of the cases by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>  Arising from the refusal of their respective asylum applications, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the mother and her child were notified, by separate letters dated 15th November, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why deportation orders should not be made against them. In addition, they was notified of their respective entitlements to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  </p><p>  The persons concerned submitted separate applications for Subsidiary Protection.

All representations submitted will be considered before final decisions are made. Once decisions have been made, these decisions, and the consequences of the decisions, will be conveyed in writing to the persons concerned.</p><p>  An asylum application has also been lodged in respect of a second child. This application was lodged on 10th July, 2012. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not my practice to comment on individual asylum applications where a final decision has not been made.  The Deputy's Question would suggest that there is a further child in this family, however, my Department has no record of such a child having been documented to date.  Given that none of the persons referred to by the Deputy have a right of residency in the State, the issue of naturalisation does not arise at this time. </p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

However, assistance is available from a variety of sources to help those affected by cyberbullying. I mention, in particular, the Safer Internet Ireland project which is coordinated by the Office for Internet Safety in my Department. The National Centre for Technology in Education, an agency for the Department of Education and Skills, participates in the project. It operates two sites: <i>www.webwise.ie</i> provides advice and information to parents and teachers, while <i>www.watchyourspace.ie</i> provides advice to young people on how to manage their online activities. </p><p>  The ISPCC and the National Parents Council (Primary) also participate. Both organisations offer assistance through their confidential telephone helplines on how to deal with cyberbullying. The Office for Internet Safety itself supplies very useful guides, including &quot;A Parents Guide to Social Networking Sites&quot; and &quot;A Guide to Cyberbullying&quot;.  I take this opportunity to remind those who are being or have been subjected to bullying, including cyberbullying, that, at least in some cases, the criminal law may offer redress. Bullying in any form may, after all, amount to an assault in just the same way as a physical attack on a person. I would therefore say to victims and their parents that where the evidence exists, the Gardai should be notified. </p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate also that in an economic climate of dwindling resources, financial and human, I could not deem the future compilation of the requested information as an essential service such as would justify the allocation of resources to such a project.  The Deputy should note, however, that the great majority of persons he refers to would be asylum seekers.  As a result, each individual asylum applicant would have had their individual asylum claims assessed having regard for the claims made as measured against reliable, up to date information relating to the relevant country of origin.  Each applicant who was accepted as being an unaccompanied minor would have had their claims assessed, at both first instance and appeal, in a manner as befitted the age and the degree of maturity of the individual applicant.  Additionally, each minor applicant, accompanied or unaccompanied, would have had access to legal representation throughout the asylum process and would have been assisted by their parent, guardian or social worker as appropriate. In circumstances where the individual asylum claim was refused, the individual applicant would have been advised as to their entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection and to submit written representations to the Minister setting out reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against them.  Any Subsidiary Protection claim lodged would have been investigated having regard for the claims made as measured against reliable, up to date information relating to the relevant country of origin. In circumstances where the Subsidiary Protection application was refused, the case would then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).</p><p>  The Deputy should also note that the consideration of a case under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) is a very detailed one given that in all instances, regardless of whether an applicant is minor or adult, accompanied or unaccompanied, any representations submitted must be considered under the variety of headings set out in Section 3 (6) of the same Act.  These headings include; the age of the person, their family and domestic circumstances, the length of time they have been in the State, their connection(s) to the State, their employment record and employment prospects, their character and conduct, the common good and any humanitarian issues raised in support of the case to remain in the State.  A <i>refoulement</i>  consideration must also be carried out i.e. an assessment as to the safety of returning that person to their country of origin having regard for the political and human rights conditions prevailing in that country at that point in time.  Consideration must also be given to the person&#8217;s rights to a private and a family life, as provided for under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and to the rights of any Irish citizen child or children directly associated with the case.  Once all of these matters have been considered, a decision must be made to make a Deportation Order or to grant permission to remain in the State. Where a Deportation Order is made, the enforcement of that Order becomes an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p><p>  Against this background, the Deputy will appreciate that every case is dealt with on an individual basis and in a comprehensive manner.  The Deputy should also appreciate that the collection and compilation of the details he refers to cannot be justified at this time and, as such, I do not propose to request my officials to do so.</p></reply>

The Tribunal is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick, former President of the District Court.  The Tribunal was established arising from the Weston Park Talks in 2001 and in light of Judge Peter Cory&rsquo;s subsequent report on the murder of the RUC officers in a desire to get at the truth of these suggestions of collusion both in the public interest and, importantly, in the interest of the families who were bereaved by this atrocity.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 12 October the Clerk of the D&aacute;il received a letter from the Tribunal Chairman requesting an extension of the deadline for the conclusion of the Tribunal&rsquo;s work and setting out the reasons for his request.  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il laid that letter before both Houses.  While it is clearly a matter of concern that a further delay would arise in the Tribunal&rsquo;s progress towards conclusion at such a late stage in the Tribunal&rsquo;s hearings, at this stage the matters arising are properly ones for the Tribunal Chairman to address.  It would not be possible for me to comment on the matter without impinging on the ongoing work of the Tribunal.

Such appointments are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established pursuant to the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  Under section 16 of the Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the Advisory Board submits to me, as Minister for Justice and Equality the names of the persons recommended for appointment.  I then bring the names to Government and the Government decides the nomination.  Section 17 of the same Act provides that these procedures shall not apply where the Government propose to advise the President to appoint a serving judge.</p><p>  A review of the current appointment procedure is ongoing and the matter will be considered further on completion. The review is wide-ranging and includes consideration of the following issues:<blockquote>- the need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence;<br /><br />- eligibility for appointment;<br /><br />- composition of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board;<br /><br />- the appointments process;<br /><br />- accountability in respect of its functioning; and<br /><br />- promoting equality and diversity.</blockquote>Any proposal to revise the current system of judicial appointments would involve amendment of the legislation and would, of course, be a matter for consideration by Government in due course.</p></reply>

This can arise often in cases of a family tragedy, where due sensitivity  is not exercised.  Other examples might be the taking of revealing photographs, and here, the use of long lens photography is particularly problematic where a person is neither doing anything newsworthy or seeking publicity.</p><p>  I support the right of the media to investigate and express views on matters of public interest.  However, this cannot be at the expense of the rights of citizens to go about their business and to retain, as they choose, their anonymity.  The Irish media, in general, have been respectful of privacy. In this regard, perhaps we might note that they are mindful of the principles contained in the Code of Conduct of the Press Council as well as the protection offered by the Constitution as enunciated in a number of court decisions over the years.  However, unfortunately, the temptation to outrage can be  lurking, particularly in the calculation of a commercial benefit.</p><p>  The Privacy Bill 2006 was restored to the Order Paper of the Seanad in June 2006 at my request.  In restoring the Bill to the Order Paper, my intention was to examine its provisions and to make any necessary changes and updating to the text.  The previous Government had left the Bill on the Order Paper to give adequate time, first, to assess the effectiveness of the Press Council in dealing voluntarily with issues addressed in the Bill, and, second, to assess the impact of the new Defamation Act.  I did not want to frustrate those processes in any way. For this reason I judged it sensible merely to restore the Bill in it&rsquo;s original form.  However, I am of the view that it is important to review the adequacy of the 2006 Bill&rsquo;s provisions in light of developing case law in this area since its publication.  There is a broad spectrum of issues which need to be addressed in this debate, ranging from the role of emerging technologies, the role of social media, the role of the State, the abilities of corporations to protect their legitimate interests and the rights of private citizens to go about their affairs without unlawful violation of their privacy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-23a.1264.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102300058#WRX02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 522 and 523 together.</p><p>  The Irish Refugee Council (IRC) Report summarises many of the criticisms which have been made of the Direct Provision system since its inception over 12 years ago, concentrating specifically on issues relating to children. In support of its criticisms, it cites individual cases in order to draw general conclusions about the system.  Where these anonymised cases can be identified, the exact circumstances do not sustain the general point being made.</p><p>  This reply cannot deal with each and every point raised in the report, so instead I will summarise my position by reference to the recommendations contained therein.  Some of the recommendations - such as allowing asylum seekers work after 12 months, reinstating child benefit, allowing residents to choose and prepare meals themselves - are at odds with long standing Government policy in dealing with the issue of asylum, a key pillar of which is the Direct Provision system.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.</p><p>  In relation to children living in a safe environment, the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, charged with running the Direct Provision system, takes the issue of child welfare, and the protection of residents generally, very seriously.  All staff in centres must be Garda vetted and comply with RIA's Children Protection policy.  One recommendation in the IRC report refers to the need for accommodation centres to be in good condition and that heating, hot water and cleanliness should be guaranteed.  This recommendation is, in fact, a condition to be met by all contracted to provide accommodation.  RIA has in place contractual obligations in this regard, backed up by an inspection system which has been described in answers to previous D&aacute;il Questions.</p><p>  The report recommends that RIA should consult with families in relation to their religious and cultural needs before being dispersed to an accommodation centre.  RIA does not, and will not, designate centres as being specifically for one ethnic or cultural group.  The key objective for RIA is the provision of accommodation and coordination of services to asylum seekers who would otherwise be homeless.  The system must operate within the inevitable constraint that RIA can only accommodate persons in centres where suitable vacancies exist.  RIA will always consult management in accommodation centres who have knowledge of local services and who will advise newly arrived persons of cultural and religious facilities in the area.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of space generally, including the sharing of bedrooms and toilet facilities, there are a number of things to be said.  Firstly, in sourcing accommodation RIA must ensure that the basic legal conditions, in terms of capacity and toilet and bathroom facilities, are met.  Secondly, in relation to room sharing, where it comes to RIA's attention that accommodation is not suitable for a family where, for example, its size has increased, alternative accommodation in another centre is offered.  In some cases, this offer is not accepted and families prefer to stay in a centre.  Thirdly, in relation to families having to share bathrooms, a majority of families living in the system have sole access to their own bathroom and toilet facilities.  Whilst the nature of Direct Provision is such that en suite facilities are not guaranteed, RIA will continue to seek over time to increase the percentage of families having access to non-shared bathroom/toilet facilities.</p><p>  In relation to the recommendation regarding education, in addition to all asylum seeker children being able to avail of mainstream primary and secondary education, they may also avail of the Department of Social Protection's Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.  Further supports are provided to families through the Community Welfare service in the form of Exceptional Needs Payments (ENP's) to address once-off needs, including funding child-related activities.  Children in pre-school year also avail of free placements in preschools under the Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme.  Preschools are available on-site at some of the larger centres but the choice of pre-school under the scheme is a matter for the individual parents to decide.</p><p>  In relation to the recommendation regarding homework space, all family centres with school going children are asked to set aside a quiet space where children can do their homework under parental supervision.</p><p>  In terms of play spaces for children, the Direct Provision system is roughly analogous to other types of accommodation where children would reside, be it houses with gardens or apartment buildings.  Some centres have on-site playgrounds and some do not.  Children in centres can access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.  Centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGOs to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Many centres will, for example, facilitate parties and will also facilitate NGOs who organise outings etc.</p><p>  Direct provision has been criticised since its inception, and no system is incapable of continuous improvement.  RIA welcomes scrutiny in this regard.  But it important also to acknowledge that no asylum seeker who has sought international protection from this State has ever been left homeless; that residents get nourishment on a par with, and in some cases superior to, that available to the general population; that they receive a health service on the same basis as Irish citizens; and that children are provided with primary and secondary education in the local community on the same basis as the children of Irish citizens.</p><p>  An issue to be acknowledged in the IRC Report is the length of time spent in the direct provision system.  On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings.  All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.  This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process.  The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make.  Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.</p><p>  I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 which I intend to republish in the near future provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State.  This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements.  This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.</p></reply>

My Department has conducted an analysis of the impact of this proposal on Ireland.  The results are set out in the paragraphs under. I would emphasise, however, that these figures are not intended to be predictive of what individual farmers will get. Rather the modelling conducted is intended as an analysis tool to compare the overall impact of different proposals on Irish farmers.  </p><p>  A national flat-rate model would result in very large transfers between Irish farmers. Some 76,412 farmers (representing 57.4% of all applicants in 2009) would see their total payments rise from just over &euro;352 million in 2009, to more than &euro;654 million in 2019, representing an average increase per farmer of almost 86%. The remaining 56,683 farmers would see their total payments fall from nearly &euro;908 million in 2009 to &euro;606 million in 2019, representing an average reduction per farmer of just over 33%. </p><p>  A regional model, whereby the country is divided into two regions (NUTS 2), would result in the payments of 74,897 farmers increasing from an overall total of just under &euro;363m in 2009 to more than &euro;657m in 2019, representing an increase of just over 81% on average per farmer.  Conversely, the 58,198 farmers who lose out would see their total payments fall from &euro;897.5m in 2009 to just under &euro;603m in 2019, representing a reduction of 33% on average per farmer.</p><p>  There is no real improvement in the situation under a NUTS 3 analysis, applying the flat-rate model to eight planning regions. Again, those who gain from the ensuing redistribution of payments do so to a significant degree. In this scenario, 74,445 farmers would see their total payments increase from just under &euro;382 million in 2009 to &euro;667.5 million in 2019, representing an average increase per farmer of 75%. The remaining 58,650 would lose out by an average of 33% per farmer, with their overall payments falling from just over &euro;878 million in 2009 to &euro;593 million in 2019.</p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals provide a degree of flexibility to Member States to define regions using agronomic and economic criteria. The implications of using the nine-region model based on stocking density are not dissimilar to the regional area-based alternatives examined earlier. Again, significant losses and gains are experienced even where similar areas in terms of productivity are grouped together, and significant transfers are made from the more active farmers in each region to less active and more marginal farmers. </p><p>  We have conducted extensive modelling of a variety of other scenarios in an effort to limit  redistribution.  The approach that seems most appropriate for Ireland is the external convergence model proposed by the Commission for convergence of payments between Member States.  This is an approximation approach whereby all payments would move gradually towards, but not fully to, the average. We have submitted a paper jointly with Italy, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg and Denmark advocating application of the same methodology to the distribution between farmers on their total (green + basic) payment. Under this approach, 65,000 farmers would gain an average of 29.1% while 55,916 would lose an average of 8.8% and 8,943 farmers would be unaffected.</p></reply>

Under the Act it is an offence not to prevent the spread of these noxious weeds. The owner, occupier, user or managers of lands on which these weeds are present are subject to the provisions of the Act, including a fine of up to &euro;1,000 on conviction.</p><p>  My Department seeks to enforce the provisions of the Act throughout the Country by issuing notices to destroy in all instances where it becomes aware of the presence of noxious weeds.  To date in 2012, a total of 45 such notices have been issued. These notices are issued on receipt of complaints made by the public. Follow-up action may be undertaken by my officials with the landowner/occupier to ensure the notifications are acted upon and that the particular weeds have been dealt with as stipulated in the notice to destroy. </p><p>  Additionally, under the EU single farm payment scheme, farmers are obliged to keep their lands free from noxious weeds under the cross-compliance measures of the scheme. Failure to do so may result in a reduction of their payment entitlements. In the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 penalties under the single payment were applied to 27, 31 and 46 farmers, respectively, for failure to take appropriate measures to prevent the proliferation of noxious weeds.</p><p>  My Department continues to engage with all local authorities including South County Dublin Council and bodies such as the National Roads Authority to ensure a consistent programme of treatment and disposal of noxious weeds on public lands and roadsides on an ongoing basis.  In that context my Department wrote to the Managers of each County and Local Authority earlier this year restating their statutory obligations under the Act and reminding them of the importance of implementing measures for the treatment and safe disposal of ragwort. </p><p>  Additionally, over the course of the last number of years the Department has undertaken a number of public information campaigns to raise awareness of the impact of such weeds and the importance of controlling their growth from the perspective of reducing their spread through the promotion of best practices. These information campaigns have been targeted at both the farming sector and non-traditional land users such as land for development, etc.</p></reply>

The payment of the aid provided for under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is designed to compensate farmers for farming in these agriculturally disadvantaged areas. Therefore, it is not an option that the minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare (or one ewe per hectare) and the retention period be waived.</p><p>  However, I would remind the Deputy that, being particularly mindful on the very serious problems caused for farmers by the adverse weather, I successfully sought the agreement of the EU Commission to making advance payments under the 2012 Single Payment Scheme, with payments having started on 16 October, fully six weeks earlier than provided for under the governing EU Regulations.

Indeed, I have already indicated my support for the EU Commission proposal to apply progressive reductions to payments in excess of &euro;150,000 and to apply a ceiling of &euro;300,000, although I recognise that this will be problematic for some Member States and that it will have little practical impact on Irish farmers.  </p><p>  However, I would point out that, while I am open to considering a limit in principle, there is no provision in the Commission proposal to permit a payment cap of &euro;100,000.   Moreover such a limit would not release &euro;33 million for redistribution, since capping the payment at &euro;100,000 would still require the disbursement of payments of &euro;100,000 to the farmers currently receiving in excess of that amount.  In fact the amount available would be of the order of &euro;8 million, based on current CAP funding levels.</p><p>  It should also be borne in mind that decisions have yet to be taken on the multiannual financial framework for the EU budget for the period after 2013.  Thus, at this point, we do not know the overall amount of funding that will be available for the Common Agricultural Policy or the allocation that will be made to Ireland.  In those circumstances, it is not possible to provide definitive estimates of the impact of applying caps to the Single Farm Payment. </p></reply>

The ECCE programme requires that staff members acting as pre-school year leaders hold a childcare qualification equivalent to FETAC Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).   A higher capitation rate is available to sessional playschool services participating in this programme in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme. Staff working with children under the ECCE programme as pre-school assistants, and staff in the childcare sector generally, are not required to hold a specific qualification.  </p><p>  To determine if a City and Guilds qualification is equivalent to a FETAC Level 5 qualification and is thereby an acceptable qualification for the role of pre-school leader under the ECCE programme, my Department must be able to identify the qualification on the  published City and Guilds Qualification List.  From the information provided by the Deputy it is not possible to identify this award and if the exact name of the qualification and the City and Guilds qualification reference number is submitted the matter will be examined by my Officials and the Deputy will be advised further on this matter.  </p></reply>

The Adoption Act, 2010, does not make provision for any further extension of declarations. </p><p>  In relation to applications to the Authority for extensions to declarations issued under the provisions of Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, the Board has decided to extend the declarations for one further year, i.e. from 1 November 2012 to 31 October 2013.  In the event of a declaration expiring an applicant would need to apply for a new declaration and undertake a fresh assessment under sections 37-40 of the Act.

The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. There were 6,258 children in the care of the state in July 2012, the vast majority of whom were in foster care (5,739) and general residential care (339).</p><p>  A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability. The care needs of these young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or services commissioned by the HSE within Ireland. </p><p>  For this small number of young people, the HSE is on occasion, in exceptional cases, required to make arrangements for their placement in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and highly-specialised therapeutic services and psychiatric treatment not available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child. These placements are made in line with the <i>HSE National Protocol for Special Arrangements</i>  and are made under the order and supervision of the High Court.</p><p>  The HSE has advised me that as of 22 October 2012, there were seven young people detained in out of State secure placements. Four young people are placed in St. Andrews, Northampton; two young people are placed in Kibble in Scotland; one young person is placed in Boystown Nebraska. </p><p>  Where children are placed abroad they remain in the care of the State, they have an allocated social worker who visits them in their placement, they have a care plan and this is reviewed within the statutory framework. All units in which children are placed are subject to the regulatory and inspection framework of that jurisdiction and HSE Children and Families Services makes itself aware of any reports prior to placing a child abroad. HSE Children and Families Services supports visits from family members to children placed abroad by paying for travel and accommodation costs. The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services and my officials.</p><p>  The HSE has advised that it is currently engaged in a major process of change and improvement for Children and Family Social Services.

In these circumstances, future adoptions from Ethiopia would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State."  </p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April of this year was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasability and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement. The Authority is awaiting legal advice and will contact me once it has received this advice and completed its consideration of the matter. Once I have received the Authority's assessment I can then fully consider the appropriate next steps in this regard.</p></reply>

With effect from 1st November 2013, the price will be reduced to 50% of the original price.</p><p>-In the case of medicines which go off patent after 1st November 2012, the ex factory price will drop to 70% of the original price as soon as a generic equivalent comes on the Irish market. After 12 months, the price will be reduced to 50% of the original price. </p><p>-With effect from 1st January 2013, the ex factory price of medicines introduced to Ireland <i>after </i>September 1st 2006, will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries.</p><p>  The deal will deliver a number of important benefits, including  </p><p>  -significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, </p><p>  -a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, </p><p>  -timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, </p><p>  -Reducing the cost base of the health system into the future,</p><p>  This deal, combined with an interim agreement reached with IPHA in the Summer, means that &#8364;16 million in drug savings will be made this year. It is estimated that the deal will generate savings of up to &#8364;116m in 2013, &#8364;136m in 2014 and &#8364;150m on 2015.  A breakdown of savings by scheme is not currently available.  The cost of new drugs over the next three years is estimated to be &#8364;210 million. </p><p>  This landmark deal with IPHA comes as legislation aimed at reducing the cost of generic drugs makes its way through the Oireachtas. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution, is a priority for this Government. It is expected that this Bill will be enacted before the end of the year and will deliver further savings in the costs of medicines for the health service and private patient. </p><p>  Details of the IPHA member companies products which will be subject to price reductions on the 1st November are available on the HSE's website at the following link: .</p></reply>

The Task Force, therefore, provides a platform to secure a sustainable means of improving value for money from the very significant expenditure of the State on prescribed medicines. </p><p>  The Task Force will be made up of a number of key leaders from the healthcare system. Its terms of reference will require it to oversee and to direct analysis of the very extensive information that is held on prescribing patterns through the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The work of the Task Force will be wide ranging and include providing advice and guidance and support to prescribers and dispensers to help them improve prescribing practices and assessing the suitability of maintaining supply of certain items with limited efficacy where more appropriate items are available.</p></reply>

There are always more construction projects than can be funded from the Exchequer's capital health care allocation.  The Health Service Executive is required to prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs of completion over the period.</p><p>   Rowlagh/North Clondalkin was never included in a Capital Plan and was not, indeed, included on the HSE's proposed 2012 Capital Plan submitted to the Department.  Approval has recently issued for the 2012 Plan and details will be posted on the HSE&rsquo;s website as soon as is practicable.   In asserting that the HSE had planned to provide for PCC in Rowlagh/North Clondalkin, in its capital programme, you may be referring to lists reported in the media.  It is important to state that these lists related to work that was ongoing; that they were work in progress.  The prioritisation exercise is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.  </p><p>  The delivery method for potential PCC in Rowlagh/North Clondalkin, changed in the lists reported in the media and published by the Department as part of the Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure Stimulus Package.  This change was on the advice of the Head of Estates in the HSE as PPP was considered to be the method by which progress in this development could potentially commence quickest.  </p><p>  The method and time scale for the delivery of PCCs is dependent on a number of factors and the list will continue to be reviewed and revised as necessary.  It is envisaged that approximately 20 of the 35 potential locations published as part of the Government's Infrastructure Stimulus Package will be progressed by way of PPP.  The current position is that the HSE is engaging with the NDFA as required to progress the Primary Care Centre Public Private Partnership Programme. The HSE is currently analysing the available sites in each location and engaging with the GPs in each location to determine their interest in participating in the primary care centre development.  It is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the 20  potential locations.</p></reply>

Smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland, killing over 5,200 people a year.  All tobacco products, whether legally produced, illicit or counterfeit are injurious to health and are therefore a threat to public health.  The Department of Health&rsquo;s policy in relation to smoking is to promote and subsequently move toward a tobacco free society.  The Tobacco Policy Review Group was established to identify what further policy proposals might be introduced aimed at reducing the prevalence and initiation of smoking in Ireland.  The Tobacco Policy Review Group is due to report shortly and this report will build on our existing policies and legislation.</p></reply>

It is recognised that in an environment of increasing prohibition of tobacco advertising and sponsorship worldwide, the cigarette pack has become a key marketing tool for the tobacco industry to promote their products.  I welcome the recent victory of the Australian Government in defence of its plain packaging legislation.  I am supportive of any international developments in relation to plain or standardised packaging.</p><p>  Plain packaging is one of the issues being considered in the context of the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive by the European Commission in consultation with Member States.  As I indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 245 of 12th July 2012, I have indicated in discussions with the European Commission, my wish that the proposal for a revision of the Directive be published as soon as possible in order for Ireland to significantly progress it during the Presidency in January 2013.  The introduction of plain packaging is also being considered by the Tobacco Policy Review Group which is expected to report within a matter of months.</p></reply>

The upper limit for consultants who held a contract prior to 2008 is 30%.  The HSE has put in place arrangements to measure consultants' private practice and to pursue issues of compliance where necessary.  The Contract provides for a series of steps to be taken where a consultant exceeds the level of private practice permitted in his or her contract.</p><p>  Under Consultant Contract 2008 written notification must issue within a month to any Consultant who exceeds the permitted level of private practice.  If the problem persists after six months has elapsed, further written notification issues and the Consultant is required to meet with the Clinical Director, Hospital Manager or Chief Executive Officer and a timetable established for resolution of the issue within the following three months.   If the matter has not been resolved, the Contract provides that the employer may require the Consultant to remit the private practice fees in respect of the excess activity to a Research and Study Fund. The requirement that Consultants pay back excess fees is to ensure that monies arising from private practice in excess of the permitted limit revert to the public health system via the research and study fund.  </p><p>  The proposals which emerged as a result of the recent engagement at the Labour Relations Commission between health service employers and the two consultant representative bodies encompassed provisions regarding private practice.  These include a commitment by consultants to measures that ensure that public patients waiting for elective care of any type are seen within clinically appropriate timeframes and that the entirety of the Consultant&rsquo;s private activity, including in-patient, day-patient and out-patient activity, is within contractual limits. The parties also agreed that the current methodology and process for private practice measurement would be accepted as a minimum base for the purpose of determining compliance with contractual commitments on private practice.  The proposals also provide for a much strengthened management role for Clinical Directors in respect of all consultants.</p><p>  I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in respect of consultants working at St Vincent's Hospital, and elsewhere, fulfilling their public service obligations. My Department recently wrote to the Deputy CEO of the HSE, emphasising the need for the management of individual hospitals (HSE or voluntary)  to pursue full compliance with the terms of consultant contracts, including the provisions on private practice. I understand this requirement has been communicated by the HSE to all relevant management, including the CEO's of voluntary hospitals.  </p></reply>

Irish case law and national and international guidelines suggest that in making decisions for those who lack capacity, health and social care professionals should determine what is in the patient&rsquo;s best interest, which is decided by reference to their values and preferences where known.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive established the National Consent Advisory Group in June 2011.  This group is multi-agency and multidisciplinary in membership. The aim of this group is to consider the issue of consent to examination and treatment in health and social care and to develop a national consent policy and was chaired by Dr. Deirdre Madden, senior lecturer in Law in UCC.  A draft of the policy document was made available as part of a public consultation in May of this year, to which over 200 submissions were received.   The final draft has been prepared and should be available in the near future.  In addition, the Government legislation programme indicates that a Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current session which may address this issue.</p></reply>

It is important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.

National data on epilepsy is available from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) Health Module.  This was undertaken most recently in Quarter 3, 2010.  The QNHS Health Module is a self-reported survey based on a sample of 15,673 persons over the age of 17.  Respondents are asked if they have ever been diagnosed with epilepsy.  The results, when grossed up to the national population, provide an estimate of approximately 16,000 persons over the age of 17 in Ireland having been diagnosed with epilepsy.  This is broadly in line with international studies on the epidemiology of epilepsy.  This survey-based figure, nevertheless, needs to be interpreted with caution both because it is based on self-reporting rather than definitive diagnosis and because it is based on small numbers (i.e. less than 1% of the sample).  The small numbers preclude reliable breakdown of figures below the national level. </p></reply>

The Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 was enacted in February 2012 and commenced on 12 March 2012. It eliminates restrictions on fully qualified and trained GPs wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the General Medical Services (GMS) contract.  By 30 September 2012, 78 GPs had been granted a GMS contract by the Health Service Executive under the provisions of the Act and in excess of 40 applications are currently being processed.  Legislation was not required in relation to the other provision of the Memorandum.</p><p>  In relation to the number of GPs qualifying, the HSE and the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) have reached agreement on an alternative route to specialist registration for doctors who have extensive experience in General Practice, but who lack some component of training to become eligible for specialist registration as a GP.  Details of this &quot;practice based assessment model&quot; were published on the ICGP website in September 2011.    It is anticipated that the application period for this route to membership will open in early 2013.</p><p>  In relation to restrictions on advertising, until 2009, the Medical Council's <i>&#8220;Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Professionals&#8221;</i>   placed advertising restrictions on new GPs.  They were only allowed to advertise their arrival in an area by way of newspaper notices.  Other methods of advertising, including notification of prices, were not allowed.  The Medical Council&#8217;s current guidelines, published in November 2009, have removed these restrictions. GPs are now free to advertise their services and their prices.</p><p>  In relation to the pharmacy profession, the 50% mark-up payable under the Drug Payment Scheme was reduced to 20% in 2009 by way of regulations made under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. These regulations are enforced by the HSE.  No further action is required under this heading.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-23a.1583.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102300058#WRCC00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 629 and 660 together.</p><p>  Directive 2010/63/EU will considerably strengthen the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing. The Directive will also minimise the number of animals used and require alternatives to be used wherever possible, while ensuring a level playing field for EU industry and enhancing the quality of research conducted in the EU. The &quot;Three Rs&quot; principle of replacing, reducing, and refining animal testing is firmly anchored in the new legislation and I strongly endorse this development.  The Irish Anti-Vivisection Society (IAVS) has raised concerns about the level of consultation and scrutiny on the new Directive and about the transposition of Article 55 (Safeguard Clauses). </p><p>  I cannot accept that consultation on and scrutiny of the Directive has been minimal. My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed Directive and again in October, 2011 in order to inform our transposition of the provisions of the Directive into Irish law. In both cases these public consultations were advertised in the National media and key stakeholder groups were also directly advised of the consultation process. Officials of my Department have met with a range of interested parties (including the IAVS on two occasions) on the Directive.</p><p>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the <i>Joint Committee on European Scrutiny</i> on the then proposed Directive and indicated that the transposition of the Directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe. Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new Directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with. It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  The Joint Committee, after consideration of the proposed Directive, agreed that no further scrutiny was required, given that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 Directive and in view of the scope allowed in the Directive for Member States to decide on practical transposition measures. </p><p>  Many of the Directives provisions are mandatory. The discretionary Safeguard Clauses set out at Article 55 cover exceptional circumstances in which Member States may, on scientifically justifiable grounds, provisionally authorise applications for derogations relating to a number of restrictions set out in the Directive, including the use of on non-human primates set out in Article 8 and authorisation of procedures involving severe pain set out in Article 15.  The European Commission, assisted by an Advisory Committee (composed of Member State representatives and chaired by the Commission) must, subsequently, authorise or disallow any such provisional authorisation. </p><p>  Such exceptional provisional measures could be required to deal with an unexpected outbreak of a life threatening or debilitating clinical condition in humans or to allow for experiments necessary for the preservation of species. The Safeguard Clauses would also allow for emergency measures in the event of a natural disaster that resulted in, for example, the contamination of land and livestock or the outbreak of an infectious pathogenic disease.</p><p>  It is clear from the Directive that the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing is at the core of this legislation and I strongly endorse this objective. Nevertheless, and even if difficult to foresee, it is my considered view that is both reasonable and correct to make provision for exceptional emergency situations that might arise, if only to ensure that the necessary legislative tools are available to deal with such an eventuality. The Directive provides Member States with the legislative tools needed to respond in an effective way to such situations. Not to incorporate such tools in our transposition of the Directive might prove to be most regrettable if fate were to take a hand. </p><p>  It will only be possible to introduce any such provisional measure by way of Ministerial Order after consultation with the Irish Medicines Board (the Competent Authority for the purposes of the Directive) and any such measure will be subject to EU Member State and Commission scrutiny and approval. </p><p>  I would, finally, like to draw the attention of Deputies to the comments of European Environment Commissioner Potocnik who has said that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world. The new Directive will be transposed into Irish law during November and will become operational from 1 January 2013.</p></reply>

However, it is accepted that in most instances a modern, well-equipped, accessible premises is central to the effective functioning of the Primary Care Team and evidence from Teams accommodated in new Primary Care Centres is very positive.  Co-location of all members of a Team is preferred as it has advantages for both service users and professionals working with Teams.</p></reply>

There are always more construction projects than can be funded from the Exchequer's capital health care allocation.    The Health Service Executive is required to prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs of completion over the period.</p><p>   Rowlagh/North Clondalkin, Coolock, Dungloe, and Ballymote were never included in a Capital Plan and were not, indeed, included on the HSE's proposed 2012 Capital Plan submitted to the Department.  Approval has recently issued for the 2012 Plan and details will be posted on the HSE&rsquo;s website as soon as is practicable.   With regard to Rathdrum, it has been included in the HSE's capital programme not as a HSE build but for potential lease. Rowlagh/North Clondalkin,  Dungloe, and Rathdrum were three of the locations advertised by the HSE when expressions of interest were sought from the private sector for the delivery of primary care facilities.  In asserting that the HSE had planned to provide for PCCs in Rowlagh/North Clondalkin, Coolock, Dungloe, Ballymote and Rathdrum in its capital programme, you may be referring to lists reported in the media.  It is important to state that these lists related to work that was ongoing; that they were work in progress.  The prioritisation exercise is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.  </p><p>  The delivery method for potential PCCs in Rowlagh/North Clondalkin, Coolock, Dungloe, Ballymote and Rathdrum changed in the lists reported in the media and published by the Department as part of the Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure Stimulus Package.   This change was on the advice of the Head of Estates in the HSE as PPP was considered to be the method by which progress in these developments could potentially commence quickest.  The method and time scale for the delivery of PCCs is dependent on a number of factors and the list will continue to be reviewed and revised as necessary.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive has published &quot;Standards and Recommended Practices for Post Mortem Examination Services&quot; and has circulated these to relevant hospital staff.  The overall aim of the standards and recommended practices for post-mortem examinations is to drive high quality post-mortem examination services, which are based on current legal requirements and in keeping with best professional practice.

It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body.  Since 2007, the ODAO has successfully supported the DAO in providing the appeals service envisaged under the Disability Act.  From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.</p><p>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position.  The former Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31/12/2011 and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post. As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&rsquo;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the DAO and is independent in the performance of this function. This is a temporary measure only and a longer term arrangement will be put in place as soon as possible.  </p><p>  The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act. As part of its service the ODAO operates a Lo-Call phone line which is manned during normal working hours.  The availability for public inspection of the Determination and Reasons for Decision Reports that are produced at any particular time by the DAO is a matter for the DAO and is outside of my remit.  I am advised by the DAO that all completed Determinations are available on the ODAO website.  I can confirm that an amount of &euro;12,500 plus VAT in legal costs has been incurred by the ODAO since 1 January 2012. </p></reply>

The Unit&rsquo;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining waiting lists, including GP referrals.  I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made to date by the SDU in relation to both emergency departments and waiting lists.</p><p>  A major priority has been to improve access to emergency care and I welcome the fact that for significant numbers of patients, the experience in our emergency departments has been markedly improved.

In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who continue to suffer the effects of having had this procedure.  These services include the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up. </p><p>  In relation to symphysiotomy generally, my Department has commissioned an independent research report in relation to the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.  The research included a consultation process involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have experienced symphysiotomy.  It is expected that this report will be presented to the Department in the near future.  It is intended that the research report will inform the Department&rsquo;s overall consideration of this matter, including the consideration of any actions that may be required and possible legal implications.  It would be premature for me to make any other comments at this stage on what actions might be taken, prior to giving full consideration to the recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

However, the prioritisation exercise is a dynamic process constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.  There are more than 200 locations under consideration for progression and the list of locations requires further work and objective analysis by my Department and the HSE, particularly with regard to the feasibility of implementation.

The NTA makes a payment to the two bus companies that operate the PSO services for those services.</p><p>  The legislation governing the licensing of commercial public bus passenger services, such as Expressway, is the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009. Responsibility for the licensing of Public Bus Passenger Services rests with  the National Transport Authority (NTA). The NTA published, in November 2010, new Guidelines for the licensing of public bus services which set out the basis for a reformed licensing system for commercial bus passenger services in the State. There is nothing to prevent Bus &Eacute;ireann from applying for an amendment to a licence in respect of such a service. As part of its Expressway turnaround plan, Bus &Eacute;ireann is making changes to a number of its commercial services to meet the customer demand for limited stop services with quicker journey times and airport connections so that such services are commercially viable.  Failure to react to this market demand and competitive pressures would result in a reduction and/or loss of Expressway services and jobs.</p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann may also propose route changes to services provided by the company under its PSO contract with the NTA. Any such proposals are subject to negotiation with the National Transport Authority, who may accept, reject or modify any requested change to a PSO service. </p></reply>

Since my Department advertised new procedures for appointment to boards on Friday 8th April 2011, all appointments from that date have followed these procedures.  However, given the importance of ensuring the right mix of skills and experience on every board, appointments are not necessarily confined to those who have made an expression of interest. In this context, I refer the Deputy to D&aacute;il Question No:1944 of Tuesday 18th September last which lists all board appointments made following the public advertisement process. The position has not changed since then.  Unless there are exceptional circumstances, prior to the appointment of a new Chairperson they will appear before the joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications.</p></reply>

No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test.  In exercising its supervisory role in monitoring the delivery of the NCT, the Authority appointed Price Waterhouse Coopers and the Automobile Association to monitor the ongoing compliance of Applus+ in regard to its performance and acceptable standards contained in the Project Agreement. Standards measured include premises, test equipment, staff, test arrangements, facilities management, financial management, information technology infrastructure and operations, customer service and provision of public information. In addition to this, there is regular ongoing contact between the RSA and my Department on matters pertaining to the NCT.</p><p>  While it is neither practical nor affordable to observe every one of the 1.4 million tests and re-tests conducted each year across Ireland&rsquo;s network of 47 test centres, I understand that the oversight arrangements of the RSA seek to verify independently the quality and integrity of NCT testing. The supervisory mechanisms employed by the RSA use a range of tools (inspections, data trend analysis, check-tests and consistency tests amongst them) to build a statistical and evidential foundation of data that provides confidence of adherence to standards and performance requirements.  These supervisory mechanisms are continually subject to review and improvement, involving not only the introduction of new types and volumes of inspections, but also analysis of new data sets and the introduction of new processes and technologies.</p><p>  The need for consistently high vehicle testing standards is recognised, irrespective of the test centre at which any vehicle is tested, the vehicle inspector who tests it or the circumstances in which it is tested.   Since 2005 the average test duration has remained at about 20 minutes and independent reviews have confirmed that the test result is correct in more than 99% of cases.  </p></reply>

The issue of accommodating existing @ireland.com email address holders in as helpful and fair a manner as possible is the responsibility of the Irish Times. </p><p>  As the Deputies will be aware, Tourism Ireland was established under the framework of the Belfast Agreement of Good Friday 1998. It is jointly funded by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, and operates under the auspices of the North/South Ministerial Council through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and my Department here. </p><p>  With regard to consultations with my Department, Tourism Ireland first informed my Department in July 2012 that the opportunity to acquire the domain name &quot;ireland.com&quot; had arisen. The question of when I approved the purchase does not arise as it was an operational decision with the purchase price coming from existing resources allocated to the agency for the exercise of its functions. No supplementary or specific allocation is being made to Tourism Ireland from my Department for the purchase. In terms of the value for money involved, I understand that Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s projections suggest that the costs of the acquisition will be fully recouped in just over three years.</p><p>  Reverting to the issue of the existing email subscribers, I understand that the Irish Times have contacted all @Ireland.com subscribers to advise them that the email service will be discontinued from November 7th 2012 in terms of sending or receiving messages. Users will however, be able to access their account until December 7th for the purpose of transferring any data currently saved on their account.  In order to help users to move easily to a new provider, I am informed that the Irish Times has a helpline in operation from 8 a.m to 8 p.m. and there is also a step-by-step guide available on the Ireland.com website to assist their customers with the transition.  I obviously share the  desire to ensure that nobody is inconvenienced by the purchase of the domain name. However, Tourism Ireland only bought the domain name, www.ireland.com, and not the customer database of email subscribers. Nevertheless, I understand that Tourism Ireland is in direct contact with the Irish Times to see if any further measures can be taken to minimise the inconvenience to existing e-mail account holders.</p></reply>

The aim of the branding is to provide greater recognition of taxis, promote greater professionalism of the industry and to reduce the potential for unlicensed vehicles to operate as taxis.  The National Transport Authority is now progressing with the implementation of the taxi &ldquo;branding&rdquo; as set out in that report.  </p><p>  The current licensing requirements require that taxi vehicles are fitted with a &ldquo;tamperproof&rdquo; licensing disc, which is affixed to both the front and rear windscreens by a contractor on behalf of the National Transport Authority. While it is acknowledged that the requirement for a decal on the side of the vehicle will render it more visible as a taxi, it is still the case that, even without the roof sign, the vehicle is always identifiable as a taxi to someone knowledgeable about taxi vehicles through those tamper-proof discs affixed to the vehicle.  While I note the concerns expressed about the new signage I do not think that they outweigh the benefits of more visible branding of taxis. </p></reply>

I made it clear when publishing the reports that I did not propose to accept or reject any of the recommendations in the reports until I have considered the issues in full. Whilst this process may require tough decisions my intention is to address the services gaps identified, some of which have been evident for a number of years, and to create a more efficient and effective service. </p><p>  In the main, these changes are not about saving money but rather they are about using existing staff and other resources more efficiently to strengthen the work of the Coast Guard and the Marine Survey Office, to improve maritime safety and the delivery of maritime services by my Department.  For the Deputy's information, there is no consideration being given by me to the location of a so-called 'redundancy' centre in Blanchardstown or the Dublin 15 area, which I understand has been the subject of some speculation. </p></reply>
