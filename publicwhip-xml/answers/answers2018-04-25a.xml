The Trading Online Voucher Scheme assists small businesses that are not yet trading online, to develop their ecommerce capability, pairing training with financial support of up to &euro;2,500.  This is a demand-led scheme, for which I have secured up to &euro;3 million to support a further 1,500 small businesses in 2018 to grow and diversify their markets through trading online.</p>  <p>  The scheme targets a broad range of businesses including retail, food, professional services, arts and crafts, and manufacturing. It encourages businesses to invest their own resources in developing their digital capability to target their customers effectively.  A business may apply for matched funding to a maximum value of &euro;2,500  .  The average drawdown payment by applicants under the scheme is &euro;1,800, with over 80% of expenditure relating to direct web development costs.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has been highly effective in achieving its objectives with 4,300 vouchers approved to date and over 10,000 businesses benefitting from training delivered by the Local Enterprise Offices since 2014.  Bu  sinesses, both urban and rural, who participate grow their sales on average by 21%, increase employment by 35% and 3 out of 5 begin exporting for the first time. </p>  <p>  My aim is to help even more businesses to trade online. My Department is currently scoping initiatives to build on the success of the scheme, including the development of a national website infrastructure for online application to the scheme to make it easier for more businesses to apply and for businesses to obtain information when developing their online trading presence businesses.  Furthermore over 500 small business owners across the country have participated in digital literacy training under the Getting Citizens Online programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-25a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042500068#WRA01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 33 together.</p><p>As Minister, I am responsible for the postal sector including the governance of An Post.  Operational matters relating to the company&rsquo;s retail business, including the post office network, are matters for the Board and management of An Post.  Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and am concerned to ensure the needs of those communities continue to be met.</p><p>An Post&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2017, published last week, records an operating profit for 2017 of &euro;8.4m reflecting the hard work that has been undertaken over the past year to restructure the company.  In response to the challenges facing the company, the Board has overseen the preparation of a comprehensive strategic plan, the objective of which is to secure the long term viability of both the post office and mails businesses and return the company to a sound financial footing.  The &euro;30m Government loan provided to An Post late last year ensures that the company can continue to roll out its strategy quickly, building on the momentum of actions already taken<font color="#1F497D"> </font>including the continuation of daily mail deliveries and the renewal of the post office network.</p><p>The strategic plan harnesses the company's existing strengths such as its nationwide reach, trusted brand and the relationship of postmasters with communities, both rural and urban.  At the same time, An Post has recognised that it must embrace the digital agenda and this is reflected in the plan, especially in the emphasis on growing the parcels business. Enhanced banking services are becoming available through the post office network with the smart bank account.  It is expected that further such opportunities will be available across the network, especially as high-speed broadband becomes widely available through the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  The Government has also committed to exploring the potential for extra Government business to be channelled through the network and my Department is engaging with other relevant Government Departments in this regard. </p><p>As part of the strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post, An Post Retail. Last week An Post announced its plans for a modernised Post Office Network.  The vision centres around the availability of new services around a modernised, revitalised network.  Such services will include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses.  The announcement by An Post is supported by an agreement reached with the Irish Postmasters Union executive following 3 months of intensive negotiations under the guidance of Mr Turlough O&rsquo;Donnell SC. While I am conscious that final acceptance of the agreement is still subject to a ballot of IPU members, the announcement represents a positive first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas.  The fact that there would be no compulsory closures of post offices is a highly significant outcome of the negotiations.  The deal will see An Post invest &euro;50m in growing and modernising the network and includes agreement on a protocol which I specifically sought to help manage the modernisation of the network in a transparent and community focussed manner.  IPU members will be balloted on the proposals later this month.  </p><p>I am also pleased to advise that further Government funding of &euro;80,000 has also been secured to roll out a pilot scheme for &ldquo;Digital Assist&rdquo; which will see 10 post offices equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions.  Ten pilot schemes will be located in rural post offices and will be in place later this year. </p><p>Given the scale of the challenges it is facing, the Company will have to pursue an ambitious agenda across its various business areas and there is likely to be significant change and new business models implemented in the coming years.  This should be viewed positively as it will result in a solid, sustainable business for the future. </p><p>In considering this issue, there are two elements to consider, the funding of An Post and the adequacy of income for individual postmasters.  For the smaller post offices, it is difficult to see how some postmasters will be in a position to adapt to the changes necessary to renew the network and, in some instances, the best option for them may be to exit the business. </p><p>While financial and structural challenges remain, achieving a common view of the steps we need to take to regenerate the network is of great significance as the company re-builds and takes action to secure the future of the company and the network.  The agreement is a significant milestone and shows that An Post, the IPU and Postmasters have the potential to work together to deliver a viable and sustainable future for the post office network to the benefit of all parties and most importantly our citizens.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-25a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042500068#WRA01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 58 and 64 together.</p>  <p>  The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.  </p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency in April 2017, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p>  <p>  Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July of last year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Although this first Plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy. </p>  <p>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020.  While good progress has been made to date, with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advising that 9.5% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  The SEAI's most recent assessment is that Ireland will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020, indicating that Ireland should be between 82% to 96% towards its target.</p>  <p>  In relation to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets, the Renewable Energy Directive provides a comprehensive framework for Member States to work towards achieving individual and EU renewable energy targets, including mechanisms for countries to work together such as statistical transfers, which allow Member States to meet their targets by purchasing credits from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets.</p>  <p>  In the absence of an established market mechanism, estimates of the cost of using instruments such as statistical transfers are necessarily tentative.  Work undertaken by the SEAI in 2016 indicated that the cost to Ireland of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets may be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.  Present indications &ndash; based on trades agreed by Luxembourg late last year - are that the costs per percentage point for statistical transfers could be below the lower end of the range suggested by SEAI.</p>  <p>  While the focus of my Department remains firmly on meeting our 2020 target and on implementation of renewable energy measures, including a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a new Support Scheme for Renewal Heat (SSRH), contingency planning has commenced to explore the potential extent, mechanisms and cost of addressing our target within the framework of the Directive.</p>  <p>  Any requirement for statistical transfers to meet compliance would be undertaken against a background of discussions by the Irish authorities with the EU Commission and relevant Member States.  As any purchases arising would be made over a period, the costs to the Exchequer of acquiring statistical transfers to meet any potential shortfall would likely be spread over several years and the cumulative costs would not be known until 2021, the deadline for completion of all purchases.</p></reply>

At its heart is a commitment to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and reduce the country&rsquo;s fossil fuel dependency.  This ambitious vision for Ireland&rsquo;s energy system envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from that sector by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050.  The White Paper identifies the importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050 but also recognises that some fossil fuels will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.</p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government.  The National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development 2014 establishes a long-term objective to pursue substantial decarbonisation of the energy, transport and built environment sectors, as well as pursuing carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land sector.  Transition to low carbon electricity generation will be key to successfully meeting this objective.</p><p>The National Mitigation Plan 2017 provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The Plan specifies the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  It also takes into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  This first Plan begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.</p><p>In 2016, imported fossil fuels accounted for 69% of our energy needs at a cost of &euro;3.4 billion.  This marks a reduction in our energy import dependency figure which was 88% in 2015 at a cost of &euro;4.6 billion.  Renewable electricity generation accounted for 27.2% of gross electricity consumption in 2016.  The use of renewables in electricity generation in 2016 reduced CO2 emissions by 3.1 Mt and avoided &euro;192 million in fossil fuel imports.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Published data from the SEAI indicates that 27.2% of electricity, 6.8% of heat and 5.0% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2016.  Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources.  </font>The SEAI projects that Ireland will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020, indicating that Ireland should be between 82% and 96% of its target.  <font color="#1D1B11">While Ireland has made considerable progress in the decarbonisation of our energy sector in recent years this progress will need to accelerate in pace in the coming years.</font></p><p>While the focus of my Department remains firmly on meeting our 2020 renewable target and on implementation of renewable energy measures, including the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and the Support Scheme for Renewal Heat, contingency planning has commenced to explore the potential extent, mechanisms and costs of addressing our targets within the framework of the 2009 Directive.</p></reply>

As Deputies will be aware, this has led to a range of additional supports being introduced for electric vehicles.</p><p>For instance, earlier this month, a new Electric Vehicle Public Awareness Campaign was launched by the SEAI.  This campaign includes a website <i>(www.DrivingElectric.ie)</i>providing information on buying and driving an EV including the models available and links to dealers to arrange a test drive.  There will also be an advertising campaign &ldquo;The Face of Driving Electric&rdquo; which will highlight how electric vehicles are compatible with virtually everyone&rsquo;s daily lives.  Public road shows and fleet trials will be rolled out later in the year providing more people the opportunity to trial electric vehicles.</p><p>A key focus of the work of the Taskforce is examining options for infrastructure, regulation and pricing including the examination of options to  facilitate the expansion of the public charging network.  While the vast majority of EV charging happens at home, which aligns with both technology and patterns of use of vehicles, the National Policy Framework for Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017-2030 which was published in May 2017, sets out the need for increases in the number of domestic and public charge points to support the growth of electric vehicles. </p><p>The majority of the existing network of <font color="#0D0D0D">publicly accessible </font>charge points was rolled out by the ESB, through its eCars programme. The<font color="#0D0D0D">Commission for Regulation of Utilities approved an application from ESB Networks to recover the costs of this project to a maximum of &euro;25 million from use of system charges.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Following a public consultation process, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published its independent regulatory decision in relation to the ownership of this infrastructure in October 2017.  A key outcome of the decision is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges.  This is in keeping with the proposals set out by the European Commission in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package which was published in 2016. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The decision also set out the need for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis.  In the absence of State-led support, this is unlikely to happen in the near term.  Funding has, therefore, been allocated in my Department's budget this year to support the provision of public charging.  </font></p><p>The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce is examining how best to support the development of the public charging network. This has included examining options in relation to a competitive tendering process, as suggested by the Deputy, grant schemes, and other potential support measures.  A stakeholder workshop held in November 2017 and meetings with relevant representative groups has helped inform this work.</p><p>The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focuses on electric vehicles, is nearing completion and I expect to bring forward proposals that will support the provision of effective and efficient publically <font color="#0D0D0D">accessible </font>electric vehicle charging.</p></reply>

These documents were informed by extensive stakeholder engagement and public consultation. The new SEAI report, Energy in the Residential Sector, is a timely reminder of the critical importance of energy efficiency to reduce energy use and enable the switch away from fossil fuels to renewable heating systems. </p><p>A number of actions which are outlined in the NMP and LTRS are already underway to promote deep renovation of buildings across all building types and tenure.  Those actions which relate specifically to homes are outlined below.</p><p>The Better Energy Programme is funded by my Department and operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  It has been in place since 2009 and provides energy efficiency upgrades to homes.  A short summary of the schemes under the programme is set out as follows.</p><p>- The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grant aid to homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures.  I recently expanded this scheme to support the transition away from fossil fuels, and achieve greater energy savings and emissions reductions, by providing a grant for heat pumps and increasing the funding for external insulation. </p><p>- The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  I recently announced the expansion of the scheme to include internal and external wall insulation in order to increase the number of people that can receive upgrades and increase the energy savings and emissions reductions the scheme can achieve by enabling fuel switching. </p><p>- The Better Energy Communities scheme allows groups of buildings to apply for funding to improve their energy efficiency.  This scheme has resulted in innovative approaches to renovation being developed, while also contributing to the overall reduction of energy usage and emissions from our building stock.</p><p>However, I am keenly aware of the need for a significant increase in effort in the post 2020 period and have introduced a number of initiatives to support this:</p><p>- The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme is investigating the how to create a scalable offering for the deep retrofit of Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER). </p><p>- The Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Scheme, funded by my Department, is a joint policy initiative with the Department of Health, and is operated by SEAI and the HSE.  It will measure the health and wellbeing impacts associated with improved energy efficiency.  Increasing awareness of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency is critical to encourage people to invest in and make their contribution to action on climate change.</p><p>The National Development Plan 2018 -2027 recognises that improving the energy efficiency of the built environment is a central plank of Ireland&rsquo;s action on climate change. Energy efficiency will also realise benefits for air quality, health, social inclusion, business competitiveness and better public services, all of which will make a real and positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives. Exchequer investment of &euro;4 billion, along with taxation and regulatory measures, are provided for under the NDP, to ensure a step change in the energy performance in the residential sector, with upgrades to homes increasing from 30,000 to 45,000 per annum from 2021. In addition, the completion of a comprehensive &euro;750 million retrofit programme would place the public sector built environment on a sound trajectory for 2050 and lead the way in developing Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable energy supply chain.</p><p>Further details of all the SEAI funding available for energy efficiency are available on their website: <i>www.seai.ie/grants/. </i></p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.  This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  This Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has committed to completing the rollout by the end of this year.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i></i>.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website<i>www.dccae.gov.ie.</i></p><p>There are just over 101,000 premises in Donegal.  Nearly 34,000 (33%) fall within the AMBER area and will be covered under the State led Intervention. Some 56,500 (56%) of premises are in a BLUE area and fall to be covered by commercial providers, while 11,000 (11%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment.  Individuals can check which category their premises falls into by going to my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>and entering their eircode into the Map.  </p><p>Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. Since beginning their rollout in Q4 2016, eir has passed a total of 121,000 premises, including some 15,000 in County Donegal.  Approximately, a further 11,000 premises remain to be passed in Donegal by the end of this year.  By the end of eir's deployment approximately 67% of Donegal's premises will have access to a high speed broadband service.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now in its final stages.  My Department will engage with the successful bidder on the most efficient roll-out of the network.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations.  The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding ComReg's independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.</p>  <p>  Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce.  Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme.  Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland. </p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:</p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p>  <p>  - Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots.  This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.  This exercise is ongoing, and has been included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme.  It is planned to have dedicated GIS resources in place to support this. </p>  <p>  - Under Action 40 of the 2016 Report, a review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots.  This work is continuing in 2018 under a focus group to inform future policy development and initiatives, in providing guidance with respect to specific categories of locations where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority, taking account of customer expectations. </p>  <p>  - ComReg is also delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.  Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p>  <p>  In terms of tackling broadband deficiencies, the Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that today almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.

In February and March 2017, two motions calling for an updated independent study into the north-south interconnector were passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I met with the Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee and North East Pylon Pressure Campaign, together with Oireachtas members from Cavan, Monaghan and Meath in February 2017.  I subsequently met with Oireachtas members in May 2017 and most recently again in January of this year.  In addition, my officials have held separate meetings with the Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee and North East Pylon Pressure Campaign in March and April last year.</p>  <p>  All of these engagements &ndash; together with the motions - were important in my decision to commission two independent studies into the project.  The studies are designed to address the main points of the motions as well as key concerns expressed by those parties opposed to the development of an overhead line.  Some impacts such as environmental and health concerns will not be assessed since the statutory planning process is the appropriate method by which such impacts are assessed and evaluated. </p>  <p>  The Consultants undertaking the two studies have finalised their reports and once considered in my department and submitted to me it is my intention that these will be brought to Government and made publicly available.

I am very happy to report that significant progress has been made in the relatively short time that has elapsed since I published the Framework in the offices of Sligo County Council in January of this year.</p>  <p>  The NAF identifies 12 priority actions and related supporting objectives that are to be progressed in order to support and advance the implementation of climate adaptation policy at national, regional and local level in Ireland. These 12 priority actions are being advanced in line with the timelines given in the table of actions on pages 89 and 90 of the NAF. </p>  <p>  Under the NAF, Government Departments with responsibility for priority sectors are required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The NAF identifies twelve key sectors under the remit of seven Government Ministers where sectoral adaptation plans are to be prepared. On 27 March 2018 the Government requested, in line with its obligations under the Climate Act, those Ministers to begin the preparation of their sectoral plans and to submit final plans to Government no later than 30 September 2019.</p>  <p>  On foot of that Government decision, I have written to the relevant Ministers outlining the deadline for the submission of plans to Government, including a summary of the requirements on Ministers when preparing those plans and the oversight arrangements that will be in place to support implementation of NAF and the development of sectoral plans. In this regard the National Adaptation Steering Committee is currently being reviewed and restructured so as to ensure that a coordinated, comprehensive and coherent approach continues to operate in implementing actions under the NAF. This Steering Committee will now report into the High Level Steering Group established under the National Mitigation Plan (NMP) which I chair, and which has now been renamed the National Climate Action High Level Steering Group so as to address both climate mitigation and adaptation.</p>  <p>  This oversight structure will be further supported by statutory oversight mechanisms in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, including those referred to on page 88 of the NAF.</p>  <p>  Local understanding is also crucial to getting adaptation right. In this regard, and in order to further  advance key actions identified under both the NAF and the National Mitigation Plan (NMP), I announced back in January funding of &euro;10 million to be provided over five years to set up four Regional Local Authority Climate Action Offices. My Department is currently engaging with the City and County Management Association and the Local Government Management Agency to progress the establishment of this regional structure as efficiently as possible and ensuring that proper oversight and governance arrangements are put in place.</p>  <p>  I have written to the Chief Executives of each of the four lead Local Authorities concerned, outlining the obligations and governance arrangements for the Local Authority sector in relation to climate action, including with regard to the preparation of Local Authority adaptation strategies.</p>  <p>  I am also aware of the need to ensure that our relevant sectors, including Local Government, are supported in their efforts to develop their respective adaptation plans and strategies under the framework. In this regard, I intend to publish Sectoral Planning Guidelines for Climate Change Adaptation in the coming weeks, with a view to following up later this year with the publication of Local Adaptation Strategy Guidelines. I am also looking at how best to develop a Climate Information Platform (Climate Ireland) for Ireland which can act as a long-term operational support for climate action in Ireland. Such a platform can also play a key role in facilitating our National Dialogue on Climate Action. This will be critical in terms of continuing to raise awareness of the key issues pertaining to climate adaptation and resilience. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to ensuring we continue to implement all relevant actions under the NAF and I am working across the whole of Government to embed climate resilience into everything we do - whether through our new National Planning Framework or through our National Development Plan - and in doing so continue the process of making appropriate preparations so as to ensure we are climate resilient well into the future.</p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises. </p><p>There are over 2.3 million premises in the State. Approximately 540,000 fall within the AMBER area. Over 1.6 million premises are in a BLUE area and approximately 180,000 are LIGHT BLUE.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has committed to completing the rollout by the end of this year.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at . A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie. </p><p>Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. eir has passed a total of 121,000 premises as of December 2017.  Figures for Q1 2018 are expected to be published in May.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages. My Department will engage with the successful bidder on the most efficient rollout of the network.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure. There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The most recent data, for the year 2016, was published in April 2018 and is available on the EPA's website at: .</p><p>According to this data, the breakdown of emissions by sector in 2016 is as follows: <table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Mt CO2eq.</th><th>% of total 2015 emissions</th></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>19.851</td><td>32.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Industries</td><td>12.557</td><td>20.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Transport</td><td>12.294</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Residential</td><td>6.047</td><td>9.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Combustion</td><td>4.555</td><td>7.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial Processes</td><td>2.150</td><td>3.5%</td></tr><tr><td>F-Gases</td><td>1.267</td><td>2.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial Services</td><td>0.994</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>0.958</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Public Services</td><td>0.873</td><td>1.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Total ETS</td><td>17.748</td><td>29%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Non-ETS</td><td>43.798</td><td>71%</td></tr><tr><td>Total for all sectors</td><td>61.546</td><td>100%</td></tr></table></p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July 2017, specifically addresses action in four key sectors of the economy: Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use. These sectors account for the vast majority of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions and action in these sectors will be paramount to building the foundations for Ireland&rsquo;s low carbon transformation considering the cross-cutting nature of the climate challenge.</p><p>A number of different sources of emissions, comprising manufacturing combustion, industrial processes, f-gases, and the waste sector, are not specifically addressed in this National Mitigation Plan. Some of these sources comprise relatively small volumes of greenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, contribute relatively little to Ireland&rsquo;s total emissions.  Emissions from a number of these sources are also already controlled by regulation at national and EU level.  </p><p>Emissions from manufacturing combustion and industrial processes arise from a variety of sources, including the combustion of fuels in industry and construction as well as process emissions from cement manufacture. These sources are, in the main, regulated in Ireland under the EU Emissions Trading System.</p><p>Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are regulated in the EU under EU Regulation 517/2014. This Regulation includes provisions for a phase down of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) use (all HFCs placed on the EU market are now controlled through an EU quota system); a number of equipment use bans; and service and maintenance bans for high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants.  The relevant sources of such emissions in Ireland include production, use and disposal of equipment containing these fluids (e.g. refrigerators, mobile air conditioning systems, metered dose inhalers and electrical switch-gear). </p><p>In relation to emissions from the waste sector, Government waste policy is predicated on the waste hierarchy as set out in the Waste Framework Directive and seeks to minimise the generation of waste. A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the volume of waste generated in the State in line with Government policy. The Waste Management Act 1996 contains a number of key legal obligations, including requirements for waste management planning, waste collection and movement, the authorisation of waste facilities, measures to reduce the production of waste and/or promote its recovery. According to the most recent projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the EPA in April 2017, emissions from the waste sector are projected to decrease by 36% by 2020 on 2015 levels. This is primarily attributable to methane emissions from landfill reducing significantly, and is underpinned by increased recovery (including recycling and energy recovery) of waste materials and adherence to Food Waste Regulations which reduces the organic content of landfilled waste and thus its greenhouse gas production potential.</p><p>Sources of emissions in energy industries not already regulated by the EU Emissions Trading System are subject to a national carbon tax, currently set at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2 emitted. The carbon tax was introduced in 2010 and applies to kerosene, marked gas oil, liquid petroleum gas, fuel oil, natural gas and solid fuels.  The Government is committed to carbon pricing as a core element of the suite of policy measures to address and reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time. Carbon pricing has the potential to drive reductions in consumption of fossil fuels and encourage energy efficiency improvements by households and businesses. The Minister for Finance has commissioned further analysis on the carbon tax to inform the policy direction of the tax, with an examination of its mitigation and distributional impacts forming part of an assessment of possible future pathways for incremental increases.</p></reply>

This is a whole-of-Government Plan, reflecting in particular the central roles of the Ministers responsible for the sectors covered by the Plan (Electricity Generation, the Built Environment, Transport and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use), and drawing on the perspectives of a range of other Departments. The Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.</p>  <p>  I subsequently published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework in January 2018.The Framework sets out the national strategy to reduce the vulnerability of the country to the negative effects of climate change and to avail of positive impacts. Under the Framework, seven Government Departments and Agencies, with responsibility for the twelve priority sectors identified in the Framework, will be required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of the Climate Act and Framework policies. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the both National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework is overseen by a High Level Climate Action Steering Group which I chair and which reports, in turn, to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action. </p>  <p>  Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade with a strong focus on strategic investments in the areas of transport, renewable energy, grid development and interconnection, the built environment, and flood risk management, to address the significant climate change challenges that Ireland faces. Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.</p></reply>

To date, onshore wind has been the largest driver of growth in renewable energy electricity, primarily down to its cost effectiveness when compared to other renewable technologies.  My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030. </p><p>The design of the new scheme included an extensive independent economic appraisal which compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, at various scales to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines. The analysis indicates that a number of renewable technologies have converging and in some cases overlapping cost ranges, and I note with interest the continued falling costs of renewable technologies over the past year, such as offshore wind and solar PV.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">My Department received 1,250 submissions to the final consultation on the RESS which closed in November and analysis of these is now complete. I am keen that this new Scheme encourages the diversification of renewable energy technologies in Ireland, while mindful of the need to minimise the costs on the consumers through the Public Service Obligation.</font>At this stage no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies or scales will be supported under the new RESS. </p><p>A final design proposal will shortly be brought to Government for approval, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. Subsequent to a Government decision, a formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence. The new scheme is expected to open in 2019. </p></reply>

This relationship is formalised through a UK-Ireland Contact Group which meets biannually.  The most recent meeting held in Dublin on April 18 was attended by officials from my Department, the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Office for Nuclear Regulation, and National Decommissioning Authority, as well as officials from the Isle of Man administration.</p>  <p>  Through this process officials from my Department and the EPA have the opportunity to raise issues of concern directly with  the UK at both a policy and technical level.  The UK's new nuclear build programme, including Hinkley Point C, is a standing agenda item at these meetings. This engagement informed the publication of the 2013 EPA report on Proposed nuclear power plants in the UK &ndash; potential radiological implications for Ireland, which found that the routine operation of the proposed nuclear power plants, including Hinkley Point C, will have no measurable radiological impact on Ireland or the Irish marine environment.  Senior officials from my Department and the EPA also visited the Hinkley Point C site in October 2017 to learn more about the project.</p>  <p>  The UK exit from the Euratom Treaty, as part of Brexit, has also been discussed at recent meetings of the Group, including at the latest meeting in Dublin on 18 April. The on-going Brexit negotiations, including matters relating to the UK's decision to leave the Euratom Treaty, are being conducted bilaterally between the European Union, represented by the European Commission, and the UK. Ireland contributes to the process through its representation at the European Council Article 50 Working Party which meets regularly to discuss Brexit related issues, including Euratom.  </p>  <p>  In March of this year, I received a letter from the UK Minister for Energy and Industry in relation to the UK's exit from Euratom which outlined planned future UK arrangements on civil nuclear power. This letter provided significant assurances in relation to nuclear safety standards. I have welcomed this information from my UK counterpart which is indicative of the constructive relationship Ireland enjoys with the UK in this area.</p>  <p>  There are currently no safety or security concerns for Ireland arising from the UK withdrawal from the Euratom Treaty. In the first instance, the UK remains a member of Euratom, and the UK nuclear industry remains subject to oversight by the EU institutions, until such time as their withdrawal from the EU is finalised.  </p>  <p>  Last year the UK transposed Euratom's revised Nuclear Safety Directive which requires EU countries to give the highest priority to nuclear safety at all stages of the lifecycle of a nuclear power plant.  It aims to improve the existing regulatory framework for the safety of nuclear installations, following lessons learned from the Fukishima accident in Japan.  In addition, the UK is a signatory of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Convention on Nuclear Safety and applies the strict standards on safety and security set down in the Convention. This will continue to be the case after the UK withdraw from the Euratom Treaty.</p></reply>

The areas of online safety and cyber defence also fall under the remit of other Government Departments, including the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Since its establishment in 2011, the focus of the NCSC has been on developing capacity and engaging with national and international stakeholders around sharing information, securing systems and responding to incidents. The NCSC also works to collate and analyse data from cyber-attacks and to coordinate with those targeted to introduce mitigation measures, and it continues to work with utility operators and with similar bodies in other jurisdictions to ensure that risks to infrastructure in Ireland are managed appropriately, including the active management of ongoing issues.</p>  <p>  The NCSC is also home to the national Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE) and is responsible for acting as a conduit for information to constituents (including operators of Critical National Infrastructure, Government Departments and Agencies), providing expert advice and analysis on cyber security issues and for coordinating significant incidents. Like similar bodies in other jurisdictions, the NCSC acts as a central contact point in the event of a government or nation-wide cyber security incident affecting the State. The CSIRT received International Accreditation in 2017.</p>  <p>  From 9 May 2018, European Union Directive 2016/1148, concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems will place a number of significant responsibilities on the NCSC in respect of Cyber Security, and will require my Department to establish a list of key critical infrastructure operators, known as Operators of Essential Services (OES) in the energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water supply and digital infrastructure sectors. These OES will be subject to a set of binding security obligations and reporting requirements in relation to cyber security incidents affecting them. </p>  <p>  In addition, the State will be required to apply a new regulatory regime to Digital Service Providers (DSPs), who include cloud computing providers, search engines providers and providers of online market places. As a consequence of this, and in a similar manner to that for data protection, the State will have responsibility for applying the provisions of this Directive in respect of security of services provided by some multinational companies across the European Union, as a consequence of their European headquarters being located in Ireland.</p></reply>

This involves transitioning to lower or zero carbon renewable energy technologies. The scheduled removal of government supports from peat-fired generation is line with the White Paper and the Plan. </p>  <p>  PSO support for Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Edenderry peat plant expired in December 2015. PSO support for the two ESB power stations ends in 2019. The Edenderry plant now generates electricity using around 30% renewable biomass. Bord na M&oacute;na is to cease harvesting energy peat by 2030.</p>  <p>  I would also note that greenhouse gas emissions from power generation, including the peat plants, are regulated by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Recently agreed reforms to the ETS for the period covering 2021 to 2030 are expected to increase the cost of carbon emissions and incentivise cleaner power generation.  </p>  <p>  The Government has adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy.  The primary support mechanism in the electricity sector is the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes, which support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies.</p>  <p>  My Department is developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030. </p>  <p>  I have secured Government approval for the introduction of a Support Scheme for Renewable Heat which is designed to financially support the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating and other non-domestic heat users in the non-ETS system. The scheme is planned to commence operation later this year subject to State Aid approval.</p>  <p>  Additional supports and funding are available via the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), to assist domestic energy consumers improve their energy efficiency.  I have secured approximately &euro;107m in capital funding for energy efficiency schemes in 2018, a 34% increase on the 2017 allocation.</p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of this year as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017. </p><p>There are just over 82,000 premises in County Wexford.  Some 21,500 (26%) fall within the AMBER area and will be covered under the State led Intervention. Approximately 51,000 (62%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are, or will be covered by commercial providers, while more than 9000 (12%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment. Individuals can check which category their premises falls into by going to my Department&rsquo;s website www.broadband.gov.ie and entering their eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has committed to completing the rollout by the end of this year.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at . A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie. Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. eir has passed a total of 121,000 premises as of December 2017.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

I am committed to full engagement with this Strategy and indeed expressed my commitment to Commissioner Karmenu Vella in a letter to him last February.</p><p>In my letter to Commissioner Vella, in the context of the EU plastic strategy, I asked the Commissioner to focus in particular on the more difficult non-recyclable plastics such as soft wrapping, film and single use items like coffee cups and plastic cutlery.  The Commission has indicated that an announcement will be made next month around its intentions in this area. </p></reply>

The minimum qualifying period for pension and gratuity is 12 years pensionable service in the case of commissioned officers and 21 years&rsquo; service for enlisted ranks.  For pre-April 2004 enlisted ranks, maximum retirement benefits (pension and gratuity) accrue after 31 years&rsquo; pensionable service.  In the case of pre-April 2004 commissioned officers, maximum pension accrues after 23 &ndash; 30 years&rsquo; pensionable service depending on retiring rank, service in rank, overall service etc., while maximum gratuity accrues within four years of the mandatory retirement age for the rank.  </p>  <p>  &lsquo;Post-April 2004&rsquo; PDF personnel have quite different superannuation arrangements that are more in line with conventional public service schemes generally but, importantly, retain early-paid pensions and fast pension accrual.  These PDF personnel have a &lsquo;minimum pension age&rsquo; of 50. Maximum retirement benefits, based on pensionable remuneration at retirement date, are attained after 30 years&rsquo; pensionable service.  This is the equivalent of the 40-year standard accrual period required for computing maximum retirement benefits in most other public service areas, where retirement benefits are not ordinarily payable until age 65.   </p>  <p>  New entrants who join the public service from 1 January 2013 onwards &ndash; including PDF members &ndash; are covered by the Single Public Service Pension Scheme, the terms and rules of which are fundamentally different to all pre-existing public service pension scheme arrangements.  Retirement benefits are based on a career average-earnings model, rather than final salary as applies pre-2013.  Members of the PDF in the Single Scheme retain the minimum pension age of 50 as well as fast accrual pension terms, to reflect operational needs.  Retirement benefits are based on the person&rsquo;s pensionable remuneration (reckonable earnings) throughout their total career in the public service, and not on years&rsquo; service as such.  The Single Scheme does not cap the length of time over which members can accrue pension benefits (unlike the 40-year service cap for standard accrual, or its equivalent 30-year service cap for fast accrual typically present in pre-2013 public service pension schemes). </p></reply>

This has been done both through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN responses.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for an independent and impartial investigation into the serious and credible allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  These include reports of widespread killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages which have led to the mass exodus of refugees the Deputy has referred to.</p>  <p>  In that regard, we have strongly supported the extension of the mandates of the UN Fact Finding Mission and UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, and have asked the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with them and allow them access to the country.  Their work in investigating and recording victim testimony, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability. </p>  <p>  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has referred to some of the reported actions committed by the Myanmar Security Forces as a &ldquo;text book example of ethnic cleansing&rdquo; while Special Rapporteur Lee has expressed concerns that these actions&ldquo;bear the hallmarks of genocide&rdquo;.  Ireland shares these concerns which absolutely reinforce the urgent need for the Government of Myanmar to provide access to the UN Fact Finding Mission so that these human rights violations can be fully investigated.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also actively engaged in the formation of the EU&rsquo;s position including in the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s Council Conclusions on Myanmar, which were adopted on 26 February last.  These conclusions condemn the human rights violations in Myanmar, support the mandates of the Fact Finding Mission and Special Rapporteur and call for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for these acts.  I would like to express my support of these conclusions and hope that they will send a clear message to those in military control in Myanmar.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there are plans currently underway to designate 25 August as Rohingya Remembrance Day in Ireland.

My EU colleagues and I have raised these concerns on a number of occasions at the Foreign Affairs Council, as did the Taoiseach at the European Council in October.  I reiterate my call on the Libyan Government, and all parties, including those with de facto control of territory, to take steps to eliminate ill-treatment of migrants, and to facilitate access to detention centres by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations. </p>  <p>  At the European Council in October 2017, the Taoiseach announced a doubling of Ireland&rsquo;s support to the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF), to help address the root causes of migration.  Half of Ireland's total EUTF commitment of &euro;6 million is earmarked for the Horn of Africa, where the largest number of internally displaced persons and refugees in Africa are located.  By supporting refugees and host communities, addressing socio-economic development, and building resilience, this funding addresses the long-term drivers of migration.  The other half of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EUTF is not earmarked to any one geographical area. </p>  <p>  Overall, the EUTF has allocated &euro;162 million to Libya. Over half of this Libya funding goes to projects to enhance protection for migrants, refugees and host communities, and to support socio-economic development at local level.  A &euro;46 million programme aims at enhancing Libya&rsquo;s capacity to effectively manage its borders, and this programme includes support for Libya&rsquo;s Coastguard.  The EU provides training, including in international humanitarian law, human rights and gender issues, to the Libyan Coastguard.  A further &euro;20 million is allocated to projects focused on voluntary return and reintegration, alternatives to detention, and provision of life-saving equipment, capacity building and training.</p>  <p>  As I have said before, Libya needs a functioning coastguard, both to protect its coasts, and indeed in order to rescue people in danger at sea.  I call on the Libyan authorities to ensure that the Coastguard adheres to international law at all times, including of course when lives are in danger at sea. </p>  <p>  I share the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the UNHCR&rsquo;s assessment that Libya is not a safe third country. It is for this reason that the EU has increased its cooperation with these UN agencies and the African Union, to accelerate voluntary returns by migrants in Libya to their countries of origin, and to establish safe and legal pathways for resettlement of those in need of international protection.  Since EU-AU-UN cooperation began in November 2017, the number of migrants in official Libyan detention centres has fallen from an estimated 20,000 people in October 2017 to 4,000 people as of March.  The IOM, with the support of the EU and its Member States, is continuing to assist migrants inside Libyan detention centres, while increasing efforts to reach stranded migrants outside of detention. </p>  <p>  The EU is also actively supporting alternatives to the detention of migrants in Libya.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was recently allowed to open a transit and departure facility in Tripoli to facilitate the transfer of vulnerable refugees to third countries.  The IOM is working to promote safe spaces to host vulnerable migrants, including children, in Libya.</p>  <p>  Ireland provided core funding to the UNHCR last year of &euro;7.5 million, which supports its work in Libya.  Ireland also provided &euro;9.5 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 2017.  The ICRC&rsquo;s work in Libya includes visiting detention centres to monitor the treatment of migrants, and to help them contact relatives.  In 2015, Ireland earmarked &euro;1 million in humanitarian funding specifically to support ICRC&rsquo;s work in Libya.</p>  <p>  Work such as this is a first step in improving the condition of migrants in Libya, although there is still a lot to be done to ensure that migrants do not suffer the terrible conditions which have been reported. </p></reply>

Through the Irish Aid programme, we currently provide some &euro;10 million annually in development and humanitarian assistance.  This involves support to the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees and civil society organisations working to promote human rights.</p><p>In December 2017, Ireland provided additional funding of &euro;500,000 to UNRWA to support their Gaza Emergency Appeal in response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis.  Other agencies operating in Gaza also received funding including the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). </p><p>OCHA received &euro;500,000 in 2017 for their activities in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt); &euro;300,000 of which was for the oPt Humanitarian Fund.  This is used to support the emergency response operations of NGOs and UN agencies.  In 2017, almost 80% of the oPt Humanitarian Fund addressed urgent needs in Gaza. </p><p>To date in 2018, Ireland has approved funding totalling &euro;4.25 million for UNRWA&rsquo;s Programme Budget, which supports the provision of services and assistance to some 5 million registered Palestine refugees including in Gaza.  This is an increase of &euro;250,000 on their 2017 allocation. </p><p>In March, Ireland disbursed &euro;2.9 million in core funding to OCHA and &euro;9.5 million in core funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which works throughout the oPt, including in Gaza.  The ICRC is providing material and technical support to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society and to hospitals in Gaza in their emergency response.  As part of its work, the ICRC is also working with relevant authorities and security forces to try to minimise the impact of violence on civilians and preserve a humanitarian space where health care workers can operate safely. </p><p>Ireland is also a key supporter of the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), providing &euro;22 million in 2017.  A grant of $15 million was provided from the CERF to UNRWA last month<b></b>to enable the organisation to provide urgent food assistance for more than 600,000 Palestine refugees in Gaza and the West Bank.</p><p>I am deeply concerned by the events in Gaza over recent weeks.  The T&aacute;naiste, on behalf of the Government, has repeatedly called for the utmost restraint, and urged the Israeli authorities, in particular, to ensure that any force is used only as a last resort.  The number of people injured by live ammunition is very troubling, and Ireland has supported calls by the EU and by the UN Secretary General for an independent and transparent investigation.  The appalling number of serious injuries and the loss of life exacerbate an already fragile humanitarian situation, and increase the vulnerabilities of many families, the majority of whom are dependent on humanitarian aid to meet basic needs.  Ireland is closely monitoring the situation in Gaza and will continue to provide support to existing UN and NGO partners working in Gaza.</p></reply>

This is a particular type of life assurance taken out for the term of the mortgage and designed to pay it off on the death of the borrower or joint borrower.</p>  <p>  It is an underwriting consideration for an insurance firm to decide whether to take on the risk or not. Should the insurance firm take on the risk, it may result in a large loading/premium for the customer.  Alternatively, the insurance firm could decide not to take on the risk at all.  This would be a commercial/underwriting decision by the insurance firm.  </p>  <p>  In most cases, a lender is legally required under Section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to make sure that a mortgage applicant has mortgage protection insurance before granting a mortgage loan.  However, section 126 also sets out some exemptions to the requirement on a lender to ensure mortgage protection insurance is in place and one of these is in relation to "loans to persons who belong to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to an insurer, or which would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally&rdquo;.</p></reply>

Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service is working with parents and the school to assist with the sourcing of alternative school places for the current enrolment, including 2 students at Leaving Certificate level who would be due to sit exams in 2019.  Now that students at the school are progressing to Leaving Certificate it is particularly important that these students would have access to the full curriculum and associated supports in order to maximize their opportunities to progress to further and higher education and employment.</p>  <p>  Current overall policy on Traveller education is being progressed within the framework of National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.  The Strategy has a particular emphasis on improving Traveller engagement with education and my Department is working with relevant Government Departments and agencies and Traveller representative Groups to progress Strategy actions aimed at improving education outcomes for all Travellers, including the current student cohort of St Thomas&rsquo;s School.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that Garda Drug Unit personnel are assigned on a Divisional basis and that the total number of Divisional Drug Unit personnel as of 28 February 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 231.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences, crime or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction. </p><p>In 2015 the Commissioner, established a new national Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GDOCB), which brought together the Organised Crime Unit and the Garda National Drug Unit so as to create a robust entity to effectively tackle drugs and organised crime, as it currently exists in this country.</p><p>The GDOCB leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level. This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs. I am informed that this approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.</p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures.</p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources he needs to allow him to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation including the Divisional Drugs Units.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have attached the number of Garda&iacute; allocated to the Drugs Unit for the years 2010 &ndash; 2017 and 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, and for the GDOCB since its establishment in 2015.</p><p><b>Drugs Unit Personnel 2010-2018*</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Nos.</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>378</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>361</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>310</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>270</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>253</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>258</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>256</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>236</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>231</td></tr></table>* As of 28 February 2018</p><p><b>Garda assigned to the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau  2010-2018*  </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Nos.</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>111</td></tr></table>* As of 28 February 2018</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-25a.216.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042500071#WRD05100"><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to issues raised, of which I am fully aware, in the minutes of the Authority&rsquo;s meeting on 16 November last concerning the timeline for activation of legal partnerships (i.e. partnerships between barristers, or between barristers and solicitors) under the Legal Services Regulation Act.  In the elements of the minutes referred to by the Deputy, it is recorded that the Authority expressed a view as to the external determination of timeframes on it as an independent authority and as to a manageable commencement schedule for its functions under the Act and the capacity and resource dependencies that arise. These minutes are, of course, a matter of public record. </p>  <p>  The introduction of Legal Partnerships is one of several areas of structural reform where both I as Minister, and the Authority as independent regulator, have respective implementing roles under the 2015 Act. As reflected in the minutes under reference, this can give rise to competing priorities against set statutory timelines which have to be managed in mutual consultation by my Department and by the Authority in achieving the overall key objective of implementation of the 2015 Act.  This introduction of Legal Partnerships is part of the ongoing working collaboration between my Department and the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. It is, therefore, among those matters being addressed in the Authority's first Strategic Plan for the period 2018-2020 that I will, as I have also conveyed in my Written Reply to Question No. 557, be laying before the Houses in the coming days.</p>  <p>  As I have pointed out in my Written Reply to Question No. 557 of 17 April 2018, the challenge remains that of ensuring that the roll-out of the Authority's regulatory functions in a legally robust manner can be aligned, to the satisfaction of the Authority, with its anticipated available capacity and resources as an independent regulator. In relation to resources, as the Deputy will also know from previous replies, the sum of &euro;1m was advanced by me to the Authority, under the legislation, in 2016, a further sum of the same amount was advanced in December 2017 and a further such sum, budgeted for 2018, falls to be advanced in early course. These advances pave the way to the activation in due course of the levy mechanisms in the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  The Regulatory Authority is, I understand, also engaged in detailed preparations and consultations with stakeholders for the introduction and operation of the levy on regulated legal practitioners under Part 7 of the 2015 Act. It may also make regulations in relation to the operation of the levy under section 98 of the Act. The Authority is also engaged in detailed preparatory work to set up and maintain the Roll of Practising Barristers under Part 9 of the 2015 Act which is a pre-requisite for the operation of the levy. Again, these matters are, I understand, being addressed by the Authority in its Strategic Plan for the period 2018-2020.</p>  <p>  As I have pointed out to the Authority, my overriding concern, as Minister with policy and legislative responsibility and accountability in this area, is to make early progress in commencing the key provisions of the 2015 Act that remain to be commenced. My primary overall purpose is the full implementation of the law as it was enacted by the Oireachtas in the 2015 Act, including in relation to any timelines that may apply, while fully recognising the independence conferred on the Authority in the performance of its functions under the Act and the fact that this implementation, which is a major undertaking, must be done in a careful, robust and risk-managed way.  My Department continues to work, on an ongoing basis, with the Authority&rsquo;s Chief Executive and staff, and in a manner appropriate to the independence of the Authority.  </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R.) North Division and the D.M.R. North Central Division on 28 February 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 666 and 613 respectively. There are also 43 Garda Reserves and 39 Garda civilian staff attached the D.M.R. North Division and 35 Garda Reserves and 42 Garda civilian staff attached to the D.M.R. North Central Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 140 and 170 have been assigned to the D.M.R. North Division and the D.M.R. North Central Division respectively. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the D.M.R. North Division and the D.M.R. North Central Division. </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the spreadsheets at the following links the Garda allocation in each Garda station in the DMR North and the DMR North Central areas by rank for each year from 2010 to 2017 and up to 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available. </p></reply>

The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.  As outlined, even where a decision may be made, the certificate cannot be issued until the applicant attends a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose of swearing the oath of allegiance before a judge.  In the circumstances it is not possible to give any meaningful average processing time per application</p><p>Processing timescales can often be impacted due to further documentation being required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with the office.  In some instances delays can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered.  In other instances the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application, for example, where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.</p><p>INIS devotes a considerable amount of its overall resources to the processing of these cases. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants interested in the progress of their application, details of which are available on the INIS website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie.</i></p></reply>

They include:</p>  <p>- Further new or refurbished courthouses in regional cities and county towns where facilities remain substandard (including Galway City, Wicklow Town, Portlaoise, Tralee and Roscommon) and further provincial locations such as An Clochan Liath (Dungloe) to serve as the Gaeltacht court for the region, and Tuam;</p>  <p>  - Regional Family Law Centres;</p>  <p>  - A nationwide condition survey of all court buildings in the estate will be undertaken to determine their condition and identify works required in relation to any issues identified and meet ongoing maintenance requirements.</p>  <p>  The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period remains to be fully determined. It will be dependent on the outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs which will determine prioritisation of projects from a timing and budgetary perspective. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that, as part of its provincial capital building programme, one of the objectives is to extend and refurbish the courthouse in Wicklow town to provide a significantly larger 4 courtroom venue together with a range of facilities for staff, the judiciary, persons in custody, jurors, legal professionals, other state agencies and members of the public.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has indicated that while detailed planning or design work has not yet commenced, it has purchased a number of adjacent properties, some of which will be demolished in order to create a larger site capable of accommodating a courthouse building on the scale envisaged. The Courts Service plans to undertake some of this demolition work in 2018 and has sought assistance from the OPW in this regard. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-25a.240.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042500072#WRE01800"><p>The employment of all non-EEA nationals in the State is governed by the Employment Permits Acts 2003 &ndash; 2014. Under this legislation in order to work in the State all non-EEA nationals require a valid employment permit or relevant immigration permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality which allows them to reside and work in the State without the requirement for an employment permit. </p>  <p>  Ireland operates a managed employment permits system which maximises the benefits of economic migration while minimising the risk of disrupting the domestic labour market. In order to ensure that the system is responsive to the changes in economic circumstances and labour market conditions, the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL) for employment permit purposes are reviewed on a twice yearly basis. </p>  <p>  Following a review of the Highly Skilled and Ineligible lists of Employment earlier this year certain chef grades were removed from the ineligible occupation list. This means that if an employer is unsuccessful in filling a vacancy either domestically or from across the European Economic Area (EEA) it can be filled by a suitably qualified non- EEA national. </p>  <p>  The review was evidence based on independent labour market analysis carried out by the relevant state agency.  The removal of certain chef grades from the ineligible lists will ensure that there is a mechanism to address the identified shortage of qualified chefs in the short-term.  A quota of 610 permits has been applied to ensure that in the longer term the demand for chefs is met from a steady supply in the Irish labour market and to that end work is underway to increase the supply of chefs through training initiatives such as the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship and a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship. </p>  <p>  It is also imperative that the employment permits system remains correctly oriented to meet the State&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, be they labour or skills shortages. Consequently, my Department is undertaking a review of our economic migration policy.  An Inter Departmental Group to steer the review has been established with a report expected by the end of June 2018.</p>  <p>  In order to safeguard the employment opportunities of Irish/EEA nationals, significant restrictions exist on the granting of employment permits  The Workplace Relations Commission are authorised to carry out inspections, examinations or investigations for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing compliance with employment legislation.  In respect of the alleged abuses of the Employment Permits Acts my officials will make contact with the above named person with a view to seeking more information in order to investigate the matters raised.</p>  <p>  Any queries relating to Immigration permissions and visas are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, and should be directed to that Department. If the above named person has any specific information relating to any criminal offence that person can contact the confidential Garda&iacute; free phone number on 1800 25 00 25.</p></reply>

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment.  In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Expert Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years. </p></reply>

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service.  GPs are also remunerated for services they provide on behalf of the HSE under other public health schemes, such as the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, etc.</p><p>The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 imposed a range of adjustments to health contractor payments.  These included different levels of reductions to various GP fees and allowances and the elimination of certain payments resulting in savings of approximately &euro;120 million per annum.</p><p>Despite reductions to the payment rates of health contractors made under FEMPI legislation, the total fees paid to GPs under the GMS scheme have increased during this period from just over &euro;472 million in 2009 to approximately &euro;518 million in 2016.  This increase in fees is largely due to significant developments and investment in GP services introduced in recent years, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional financial support provided by the HSE.</p><p>Following the publication of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill late last year, along with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I made it clear that Government is committed to engaging with health contractors on the revision of fees as provided for under this legislation.</p><p>In this context the Government is committed to engaging with the representatives of general practitioners on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the current GMS Contract.  The primary focus of this engagement will be on a package of measures and reforms which, if agreed, will result in an expansion in the scope of the service provided by GPs to holders of medical cards and GP visit cards.</p><p>I have engaged with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about the future resourcing of general practice.  My officials are working with counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE to ensure that the engagement process with GP representatives, which is due to start in coming weeks, is fully focused on the priorities of the Government&rsquo;s health reform agenda and measures which will contribute to addressing the strategic challenges facing the service.  If the talks process is successful and agreement can be reached on reforms that will benefit both patients and GPs, there is potential for State expenditure on GP services to increase in the coming years.</p><p>Details of the adjustments to GP payments under FEMPI are set out as follows.</p><p>SI 262 of 2009 applied an 8% reduction to the range of GP fees and allowances payable under the GMS Scheme, the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme and the (Health Amendment) Act 1996. </p><p>SI 638 of 2010 applied reductions to a range of GP fees and allowances payable under the GMS Scheme, the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 and the HeartWatch Programme, which equated to an approximate overall reduction of 9% to payments under these schemes. </p><p>- A 50% reduction was applied to the capitation fee in respect of patients aged 70 years or more who reside in a private nursing home (approved by the HSE) for continuous periods in excess of 5 weeks. </p><p>- The &ldquo;distance from the GP&rsquo;s surgery&rdquo; was removed as a factor in calculating capitation fees, which were standardised at the 0-3 miles rate within the various age and gender categories. </p><p>-The &ldquo;distance from the GP&rsquo;s surgery&rdquo; was removed as a factor in calculating out-of-hours fees and new rates applied. </p><p>- The &ldquo;distance from the GP&rsquo;s surgery&rdquo; was removed as a factor in calculating Special Type Consultation (STC) fees in respect of temporary residents, EEA visitors and consultations where a GP sees another GP&rsquo;s patient in an emergency and a 5% reduction was applied to STC fees. </p><p>- The Fund for the Development of General Practice (introduced in 1993) was abolished. </p><p>- A 5% reduction was applied to payments in respect of the practice secretary/nurse/manager subsidy. </p><p>- An 8% reduction was applied to other payments, including special items of service; leave cover; locum expenses under the fee per item contract; dispensing fees; rural practice allowance; and payments under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. </p><p>- An 8% reduction was applied to fees under the Maternity &amp;amp; Infant Care Scheme. </p><p>- A 15% reduction was applied to fees under HeartWatch scheme. </p><p>SI 556 of 2011 reduced the administration fees payable to GPs for childhood immunisations under the Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme by 7.5%, and the fees for administration for influenza and pneumococcal immunisations under the GMS scheme by 33%.</p><p>In 2013, an overall reduction of 7.5% was applied to a range of GP fees and allowance. SI 278 of 2013 reduced the fee payable to GPs for administering the influenza vaccination to the same rate as the fee payable to pharmacists for administering the same vaccination. SI 277 of 2013 introduced the following measures: </p><p>- Elimination of the special fee payable in respect of discretionary medical cards. </p><p>- A reduction of 3.1% in respect of the following fees: </p><p>- Capitation Fees </p><p>- Supplementary Out-of-Hours Fees </p><p>- Asylum Seekers / Non EU Nationals. </p><p>- A reduction of 1% in respect of the practice nurse/secretary/manager subsidy. </p><p>- A reduction of 7.5% in respect of the following payments under the GMS scheme: </p><p>- Out-of-Hours fees, </p><p>- Special Type Consultations (STCs), </p><p>- Special Items of Services (excluding immunisations),</p><p>- Rural Practice Allowance,</p><p>- Dispensing Fees,</p><p>- Second Medical Opinion,</p><p>- Leave cover.</p><p>- A reduction of 7.5% in respect of the following payments paid to GPs under the General Medical Services (GMS) 1972 Fee-per-Item Contract: </p><p>- Fee-per-Item Consultation Fees </p><p>- Homes for the Aged Consultations </p><p>- Rural Practice Allowance, </p><p>- Locum Expenses &amp;amp; Practice Expenses, </p><p>- Special Items of Service. </p><p>- A reduction of 7.5% in respect of the following payments:</p><p>- Health Amendment Act 1996 (Hepatitis C patients), </p><p>- Maternity &amp;amp; Infant Care Scheme, </p><p>- HeartWatch Programme.</p></reply>

There is no prescribed ratio of GPs to patients and the State does not regulate the number of General Practitioners that can set up in a town or community.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health (Provision of General Practitioner) Act 2012, a GP can enter into a state contract to provide GP services provided he/she is on the Medical Council's Specialist Register in  General Practice, irrespective of the number of GPs that are already established in an area.</p>  <p>  As at 1 of April 2018, there are 2,485 GPs contracted by the HSE to provide services under the GMS scheme.  A further 419 GPs who do not hold GMS contracts are contracted by the HSE to provide services under the Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, the Health(Amendment) Act 1996, Heartwatch, the Methadone Treatment Scheme and the National Cancer Screening Service.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that as at 1 March 2018 there were only 23 GMS panels that do not have a permanent GP in place &ndash; a vacancy rate of less than 1%.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review estimates a requirement of 4,970 GPs by 2031 which is an increase of 1,400 or 39% based on no changes to eligibility and current patterns of activity.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs.</p>  <p>  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  Separately, the State is seeking to train more GPs to provide GP services to the population.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and in 2018 we expect to fill 194 training places, an increase of over 60% over this nine year period.  The Government is committed to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years. </p></reply>

In order to support the commencement of the legislation, officials in my Department will work during 2018 with the HSE to develop a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p>  <p>  Part of this work includes identifying policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment. Once I have had the opportunity to consider these policy options I will bring a Memorandum to Government for a model of public funding for AHR treatment for the Government's consideration and decision.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that any funding model that may ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework set out in the AHR Bill and a model of care for infertility.</p>  <p>  While IVF treatment is not currently provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. In addition to these schemes, there is a limited specialist AHR service available through the HSE, which provides funding for fertility preservation for cancer patients whose treatment is likely to impact on their future fertility.</p></reply>

The afforestation scheme itself is voluntary and operates at a national level rather than targeting certain counties or regions. Therefore, in terms of maximising the potential of forestry to sequester carbon this very much depends on the willingness of landowners to participate in the scheme. </p>  <p>  Strategic afforestation operates at scheme level where the programme aims to encourage landowners to consider planting trees on their farms. Agro forestry for example allows for forestry and grazing on the same land at the same while the forestry for fibre planting category can be clearfelled after 15 years and not 35-40 which is the case for more traditional forestry. So far over 18,000 hectares of new forests have been established during the first three years of the programme. The midterm review of this plan, completed in February 2018, improved the rates available for all planting categories.</p>  <p>  Central to my Department&rsquo;s approach to increasing forest cover is the promotion of &ldquo;Farm Forestry&rdquo; where farmers are encouraged to include afforestation as part of their overall farming mix. Land which is underutilised and perhaps more difficult to work on could be planted with trees, while moving livestock onto the dryer and more productive fields. In this way a new income is created while maintaining overall herd size.</p>  <p>  In December 2016 Minister Doyle announced funding of over &euro;1.3m for developing the &ldquo;Irish Land Use Emission and Sequestration Support Tool&rdquo;. This project will develop  modelling capacity to examine future scenarios for agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration by forestry in Ireland. Other projects recently funded by my Department include research on biomass and renewable energy from Short Rotation Forestry which explores the potential of short rotation forestry (SRF) to contribute to biomass production and renewable energy targets in Ireland. </p></reply>

Under the current forestry programme new species have been added to the mix to create more diversity and to target climate change mitigation. Under the forestry for fibre scheme, eucalyptus and poplar have been introduced. These species have a much shorter rotation than traditional forestry where clearfell can take place after 15 years as opposed to between 35 and 40 for more traditional forestry. As a renewable energy source material wood can help to displace fossil fuels as a source of heating in local markets and can help meet demand created by the recently launched SSRH scheme.  </p>  <p>  As one of our fastest growing tree species, Sitka spruce has an important role to play in carbon sequestration. It grows well in Ireland because it is suited to our soils and climate. It has been grown successfully for over 80 years and it has proven itself to be one of the most productive coniferous species grown in Ireland and as such has become the industry&rsquo;s mainstay in terms of timber processing and end markets. My Department&rsquo;s recent publication &ldquo;Forest Statistics &ndash; Ireland 2017&rdquo; states that Sitka spruce is the most common species, occupying 52.4% of the forest area. There are twelve different planting categories within the Department&rsquo;s afforestation scheme and the most popular, known as GPC 3 is made up of Sitka spruce planted with a second species. In fact almost 80% of total planting in 2017 was GPC 3. </p>  <p>  A typical productive plantation of Sitka spruce will result in removals of 10 tonnes of CO2e per annum per hectare on average over a full rotation. In some individual years this figure may fluctuate. It is therefore important to look at changes in carbon across the whole forest estate, which was a sink of -3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2015.</p></reply>

This will be developed further under the new National Adaptation Framework now in place.</p>  <p>  The following are some of the high level adaptation option categories outlined in the document.</p>  <p>  A key adaptation option identified is the need to ensure that all policies, strategies, plans and measures for the agriculture and forest sector be informed of the need to adapt to the potential impacts of climate change.  In order to ensure effective adaptation planning across the Department an internal stakeholder group was established at the outset of the adaptation planning process.  Personnel from across the key areas of the Department were represented on this group and involved in, and engaged with, the adaptation planning process.  There is ongoing communication with this group on issues related to adaptation planning.  This group will be engaged in reviewing and the development of the statutory plan my Department is required to deliver under the new National Adaptation Framework (NAF).</p>  <p>  In terms of interagency co-operation this is something that my Department engages in on an ongoing basis.  In particular my Department has been to the forefront in engaging with Met Eireann and the Office of Emergency Planning, as evidenced during the recent storm events.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged with a number of initiatives involving knowledge transfer and communication, the Knowledge Transfer Programme supported under the Rural Development Programme being one such example.  On the international front officials are also actively involved in a range of fora.</p>  <p>  Additionally, strong support is made available for climate change research relevant to the Irish agri-food sector.  Most recently my Department has agreed to co-fund two projects related to climate and water, included in the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) recently opened research call.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing measures related to the protection of our forests from biotic and abiotic threats, including pests and diseases and fire. The environmental requirements for afforestation and land types for afforestation documents and the related industry focused training will ensure that forest planting occurs on the most suitable sites and helps to ensure the productivity and health of forests into the future. Initiatives to support the felling decision of land owners, management plans and certification in the private estate, which complement existing forest adaptation software and reports have been also developed. These measures will help to ensure that our forests continue to be managed sustainably and can adapt to the changing climate.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of ongoing locally led agri-environment and climate schemes, including the  Hen Harrier and Burren Programmes. Animal health and welfare issues continue to be a priority for my Department, we have a range of codes of practices and controls in place to support the sector in ensuring highest standards are maintained. The National Farmed Animal Health Strategy 2017-2022 launched in 2017 sets out a comprehensive set of actions for all stakeholders in the agri-food industry to work in partnership to achieve optimal animal health in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Regarding the status of the six recommendations for the monitoring, review and evaluation of the options included in the report, these recommendations form part of my Department&rsquo;s current work with respect to developing new plans under the NAF. The NAF was published in January of this year by the Minister Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is the framework by which sectors will develop sectoral adaptation plans - as required under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The NAF identifies twelve key sectors under the remit of seven Government Ministers where sectoral adaptation plans are to be prepared.  My Department is the lead Department for three of these key sectors: agriculture, forestry and seafood. </p>  <p>  The published Adaptation Planning document and the current work being carried out under the adaptation option headings are forming the basis upon which my Department will develop the new statutory sectoral adaptation plan under the NAF.</p></reply>

Many deputies had concerns about possible biases in such organisations, in particular animal welfare organisations. In response to this the legislation was drafted in such a way as to ensure there is adequate probity and oversight of the process by my Department. In particular prosecutions can only be taken through my Department.  </p>  <p>  Since commencement of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 the system authorising officers from outside my Department has worked well. All those who have been authorised have had their fitness and ability to operate examined. Authorisation has been done only where my Department has been given credible evidence about the relevant experience, training and bona fides of the proposed officers.</p>  <p>  In addition to the authorised officers from the ISPCA and DSPCA I have recently appointed two officers of Bord na gCon  to give assistance to my Department in the area of welfare.</p>  <p>  The Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 also gives powers to both Local Authorities, to the Coursing club and to Bord na gCon to appoint Welfare Officers.

I fully endorse this view.  </p>  <p>  My Department has a close working relationship with animal welfare charities on all aspects of animal welfare. Officials of my Department have met with the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum, which includes the Dogs Trust, the ISPCA and Bord na gCon, to consider issues surrounding the export of greyhounds. </p></reply>

The selection for each category is made by secret ballot with the three top voted greyhounds being selected for consideration.</p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has an intensive testing regime in place across race meetings, sales trials and at owners' kennels. For the first quarter of 2018, there have been two adverse analytical findings from 1,095 samples. From a total of 5,294 samples in 2017, there were 29 adverse findings. Every adverse finding is published on the Bord na gCon website. </p>  <p>  In 2017 Bord na gCon invested &euro;400,000 in a new analytical machine that can measure substances in parts per trillion, which allows for detection sometime after they may have been administered. Three individuals have been banned for doping or welfare offences. These individuals are disqualified from owning, training or managing a racing greyhound. </p>  <p>  In relation to the matter referred to in the Deputy's question, Bord na gCon has stated that in accordance with regulations, the subsequent investigation into the three adverse analytical findings is a matter for the Control Committee which is independent of Bord na gCon. This investigation was due for hearing by the Control Committee in December 2017 but is currently on hold due to a High Court injunction. Until the Control Committee has concluded its investigation, the prize money is withheld and no assumptions can be made beyond the status of an adverse analytical finding. In accordance with regulations, any greyhound that returns an adverse finding is immediately disqualified from further racing or trialling until a further sample returns free from prohibited substances.</p></reply>

I introduced a targeted &lsquo;Fodder Transport Support measure&rsquo; on 29 January 2018 to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers in parts of the West and North West severely affected by on-going fodder shortages. The main purpose of the measure was to support the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it was plentiful and those where it was scarce. </p>  <p>  The continuation of cold wet weather throughout March resulted in a serious delay to the onset of spring. Grass growth remained negligible, ground stayed wet and livestock had to remain housed in many cases. This resulted in the fodder problem extending countrywide with a consequent tightening of fodder availability nationally.</p>  <p>  In response, I extended the Fodder Transport Support measure to all counties and also introduced a Fodder Import Support Measure, to ensure that there was adequate fodder available to feed the national herd. </p>  <p>  However it is not possible to retrospectively include farmers as eligible for support during the period in advance of the introduction of these schemes.</p></reply>

It addresses the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions and improves integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector.

In addition, a presentation was given to Cavan County Council by the Chief Geologist of the Exploration and Mining Division of my Department on April 9th at which members of the Cavan Mining Objection Group were present. For clarity, I will ask my officials to send a copy of all correspondence and of the presentation given to Cavan County Council directly to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In brief, in response to the points raised in the correspondence attached to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I can confirm:</p>  <p>  -  To date, where minerals have been found and companies have purchased land, this has been agreed with the landowner.  There have been no instances to date where a landowner has been forced to sell their land. In addition, to date, there have been no compulsory acquisitions of land for mining development.</p>  <p>  -  The text of my Department&rsquo;s letter to the Cavan Mining Objection Group, dated 28 September, identified the environmental safeguards that have been put in place to guard against the possibility of any potential significant environmental impacts arising. It is important to note that in the case of mining, the environmental assessments are carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>  <p>  -  It is noted that Ireland ranks highly in the Policy Perception Index (PPI) because of its robust and transparent regulatory system. The transparency of the expectations with regard to adherence to licence conditions and protection of the environment provide clarity to any exploration company considering investment in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  -  The Directors of BMEx Ltd. carried out two site visits in the locality. Other than that, the data analysis and compilation has been desk-based.</p>  <p>  -  It should be noted that no application for mining has been made.  I reiterate that prospecting and exploration activities are non-intrusive and temporary in nature and environmental impact is minimal.</p>  <p>  The up-to-date position regarding these Prospecting Licences is that BMEx Ltd. have carried out data compilation and geological mapping in the Prospecting Licence Areas, and, as a result of this work, they have downgraded the prospectivity of the project and have decided to prioritise exploration elsewhere. The licences have been recently surrendered by the company.  </p>  <p>  I trust this and all of the previous correspondence clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am, however, familiar with the Seniors Alert Scheme (SAS), which is run by Pobal under the auspices of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The objective of the scheme is to encourage community support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.</p>  <p>  I understand that funding is available under the scheme towards the purchase of equipment by a registered organisation i.e. personal alarm and pendant with one year's monitoring. The subsequent associated monitoring and service charges must be paid by the participant. The equipment is funded by Pobal and made available through community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations registered with Pobal under the SAS. This scheme is funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development. </p>  <p>  The telecommunications market in Ireland has been fully liberalised since 1999. Decisions by commercial operators to invest in particular technologies, including fixed line network technologies are taken purely on commercial grounds, having regard to the cost of service provision and the anticipated revenue returns from any such investment.  Neither my Department nor the Commission for Communications Regulation, the independent market regulator, have statutory authority to oblige any particular network provider to invest in the provision of upgraded services however if the Deputy is aware of any research or new work in the technical area of panic alarm systems, I would be extremely interested in receiving this information or to facilitate a meeting.</p></reply>

Senior officials from my Department and the EPA also visited the Hinkley Point C site in October 2017 to learn more about the project.</p>  <p>  Through this process officials from my Department and the EPA have the opportunity to raise issues of concern directly with the UK at both a policy and technical level, and on that basis, my Department has not submitted an observation as part of the public consultation for the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-25a.492.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042500076#WRJ04200"><p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 67 of 14 February 2018 and to Question No. 24 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.</p><p>The 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development sets out an ambitious long-term commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and in parallel, to pursue an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. </p><p>Meeting Ireland's EU targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and 2030 will be extremely challenging. The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the EPA in April 2017, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020 against a target that emissions should be 20% below their 2005 levels. The projected shortfall to our targets reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.</p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, the EU has committed, on behalf of its Member States, to a reduction of at least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, to be achieved by reductions in the Emission Trading System (ETS) sector of 43% and in the non-ETS sector of 30%. <font color="#0D0D0D">The </font>recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets in the non-ETS sector for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction on 2005 levels of emissions by 2030.</p><p>To meet these targets, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July last year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.</p><p>Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. </p><p>The key investment priorities in the National Development Plan that my Department will take forward include: </p><p>-  energy efficiency upgrades of 45,000 homes per annum from 2021 and providing support for a major roll-out of heat pump technologies;</p><p>-  delivering energy upgrades to BER 'B' level to all public buildings and a minimum of one third of commercial buildings;</p><p>-  implementing the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme to deliver an additional 3,000-4,500 MW of renewable energy, </p><p>-  rollout of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat and National Smart Metering Programme; and</p><p>-  transitioning Moneypoint away from coal by the middle of the next decade.</p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations. The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator. </p>  <p>  With respect to the quality of mobile telephony service in other countries, comparisons between Member States and within regions can be problematic for many reasons, including the fact that the technical characteristics of mobile phone networks that determine coverage and capacity will vary between operators and locations. Other factors would include the characteristics of individual markets, including topography, population density, frequencies used etc. </p>  <p>  Various initiatives are underway to improve the quality and coverage of mobile services and broadband throughout Ireland. Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, who attend as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in their role as the independent Regulator. </p>  <p>  Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, which will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland. </p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:</p>  <p>  -  My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p>  <p>  -  Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing, and has been included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. It is planned to have dedicated GIS resources in place to support this. </p>  <p>  -  Under Action 40 of the 2016 Report, a review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots. This work is continuing in 2018 under a focus group to inform future policy development and initiatives, in providing guidance with respect to specific categories of locations where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority, taking account of customer expectations.  </p>  <p>  -  ComReg is also delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of telecommunications services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

I assured him that Ireland fully embraces the ambition of the new strategy and indeed will strive to go beyond it.   </p>  <p>  In response to the list of measures announced, I asked the Commissioner to focus, in particular, on the more difficult non-recyclable plastics, such as soft wrapping, film and single use items like coffee cups and plastic cutlery.  The Commission has indicated that an announcement will be made next month around its intentions in this area.  I believe that this will support EU Member States taking actions in this area and may result in new legislative proposals to take action at a European market level. </p>  <p>  Since I first mooted the introduction of a levy on single use non-recyclable coffee cups, some retailers are now moving to replace their non-recyclable cups with compostable cups. In order to support the elimination of single-use plastic cups by industry, I do not intend to introduce a levy on compostable cups. However, I am looking at a range of other potential levies on single use plastic items, unless there is constructive engagement by industry with my Department to tackle these environmentally damaging plastic items. </p>  <p>  Domestically, I am also looking at the Plastics Strategy's recommendations for national administrations to see what can be delivered in a short time frame.  Already many of the measures recommended in the Strategy are well embedded into Irish resource management. These measures include the existing Extended Producer Responsibility schemes run by REPAK and the Irish Farm Films and Plastics Group, the landfill levy, the plastic bag levy, as well as robust enforcement around illegal dumping and landfilling.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, consumers need to be supported in their efforts to do the right thing around plastic recycling. The national recycling list and recycling ambassadors&rsquo; programme try to ensure these valuable materials are used as a resource for our communities and economy rather than being wasted.</p>  <p>  In relation to plastic wrapping and containers, REPAK members pay fees based on the amount of packaging they place on the market and this incentivises them to reduce packaging.  REPAK&rsquo;s &lsquo;Prevent and Save&rsquo; initiative, funded by my department via the National Waste Prevention Programme, employs specialist packaging technologists to optimise packaging used and to minimise any resulting packaging waste. </p>  <p>  In relation to marine plastic, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, will be bringing in a Bill to prohibit the manufacturing, selling, importing or exporting of cosmetics, personal care products, detergents and scouring agents containing plastic microbeads that are liable to be washed into wastewater systems with the potential to reach our rivers, lakes and seas.  </p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and in those areas where commercial operators acting alone will not provide this essential service.  These latter areas form the Intervention Area that will be included in the State Intervention under the NBP. </p><p>Individuals can check which category their premises falls into by going to my Department&rsquo;s website www.broadband.gov.ie and searching the Map via eircode/address.</p><p>-  The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p><p>-  The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>-  The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of this year as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April. </p><p>Currently, approximately 1.8m premises of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can or will get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>Information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at http://www.dccae.gov.ie/communications/en-ie/Broadband/Pages/County-and-Townland-Maps.aspx. </p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has committed to completing the rollout by the end of this year.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at . A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie. Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. eir has passed a total of 121,000 premises as of December 2017.  Figures for Q1 2018 are expected to be published in May.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

For instance, collectors of waste must conduct their activities in accordance with the relevant legislation and the conditions of their waste collection permits which, <i>inter alia</i>, require that waste is managed in line with the waste hierarchy.</p><p>Waste management planning, including infrastructure provision, is the responsibility of local authorities under Part II of the Waste Management Act, 1996. The three Waste Management Planning Lead Authorities monitor on an on-going basis the generation and management nationally of municipal solid waste and other waste streams. Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in specific cases, by a local authority of their statutory functions under the Act.</p><p>The Government's policy of increasing the landfill levy to its current level of &euro;75 per tonne has provided a real financial incentive for waste operators to divert as much material as possible from being disposed of at landfill. The success of the above and many other policy and legislative measures, including the National Waste Prevention Programme and the phasing-out of flat rate fees for household waste collection, which encourage waste prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and other recovery, has meant that more waste can be put to environmentally sustainable and productive use as opposed to being buried in the ground. </p><p>Up until November 2017, different household waste collectors accepted different items for recycling, which lead to some confusion on which items go in which bin. Now, however, following co-operation between my Department, the regulatory authorities, the waste industry, Repak and environmental NGOs, we have a single, standard national list of items and materials that can be placed in the recycling bin.  Removing confusion will play an important role in improving the quality of the waste presented for recycling. This will help to ensure that these items are actually recycled, as opposed to being contaminated accidentally by householders and sent to landfill. Supporting householders to 'do the right thing' in terms of recycling is important. Householders are also being supported through a number of awareness and education initiatives such as the Recycling Ambassadors Programme<i></i>and <i>recyclinglistireland.ie. </i></p><p>Statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency show that we have come a long way in a relatively short period of time in terms of improving our recycling and recovery rates and reducing our reliance on landfill. In this regard, National Waste Statistics are available to download at www.epa.ie/nationalwastestatistics/ including the State's progress in meeting targets under EU waste legislation including the Waste Framework Directive; the Landfill Directive; and the Producer Responsibility Directives (Packaging, End-of-Life Vehicles, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, Batteries and Accumulators). </p><p>Of particular note is the reduction in the disposal (landfill) rate of managed Municipal Solid Waste, which fell from 41% in 2012 to 21% in 2014. Furthermore, 79% of managed municipal waste was recovered in 2014 (compared to 59% in 2012). Recovery includes treatment processes such as recycling or use as a fuel (e.g. incineration which converts waste to energy or co-incineration, including the use of solid recovered fuel as part of the cement manufacturing process).</p></reply>

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with co-ordinating and managing the monitoring programme.</p><p>Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality.  For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011. The zones in place in Ireland in 2017 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation; Zone B: the Cork conurbation; Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000; and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland.</p><p>Ireland currently has a nationwide network of 33 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones. This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at . The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone. </p><p>The Agency's most recent annual Air Quality Report was published in November 2017 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2016.  Values for all network sites were below the EU annual limit value, but exceeded the stricter World Health Organisation guideline values for a number of pollutants at individual sites.  The report indicates that pollutant concentrations compare favourably with other EU Member States.  It cautions, however, that it is particularly important to address PM2.5, which has been highlighted by the European Environment Agency as being responsible for the majority of air pollution-related premature mortalities in Ireland, and that NO2 concentrations in urban areas are close to the EU annual limit value, with increases in traffic numbers or certain weather conditions potentially leading to exceedances. The report can be found at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>Notwithstanding the favourable comparison with EU annual limit values, the report notes that maintaining our standard of air quality is a growing challenge.  With this in mind, I am committed to bringing forward Ireland's first ever National Clean Air Strategy.  The Strategy, which I intend to publish in the coming weeks, will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote integrated measures across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives.</p><p>A key part of the Strategy will be the expansion of our monitoring and data gathering capacity, to better inform policy choices. Following a review by the EPA of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to develop a new Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) which aims to enhance and build on current arrangements. The new national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme is being developed under Section 65 of the EPA Act, 1992 as amended. One of the key objectives of the programme is to enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public.  The statutory basis for the programme underlines the importance placed on air quality monitoring in Ireland.  The AAMP will double the number of ambient air quality monitoring stations in Ireland by 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. Further details on the timeframes for the expansion of the network will be released as they become available. I fully support this important initiative, and have committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme.</p></reply>

Public road shows and fleet trials will be rolled out later in the year providing more people the opportunity to trial electric vehicles. </p><p>The increasing use of electric vehicles, along with increases in electricity production from renewable sources, will contribute to a significant reduction in carbon emissions.  In addition, it will assist in reducing emissions of air pollutants associated with diesel and petrol vehicles, such as fine particulate matter, which have a detrimental impact on both human health and environmental ecosystems.</p><p>At the end of March this year, there were over 4,500 electric vehicles on Ireland's roads. I expect the wide range of support measures and incentives that are in place to increase the rate at which electric vehicles are being taken up. </p></reply>

The strategy will take a joined-up, cross-government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years and focus on supporting families, good health and positive early learning.</p><p>The development of the Strategy is being informed by national and international evidence on what makes most difference in helping to ensure that the early experiences of young children are positive.  Consultation on the important issues that the strategy should address has been undertaken with young children as well as with representatives of key organisations and interest groups in the area.  A further consultation event will take place in the coming months. The drafting of the Strategy is well advanced and discussions are taking place with colleagues across Government to progress its development.</p><p>The work of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is key to financially supporting families with young children.  Discussions between officials in DEASP and DCYA in respect of the Early Years Strategy have commenced and are ongoing.  An Inter-Departmental Group including a representative from DEASP has been convened and has begun its work.</p><p>Decisions about commitments in the Strategy will be taken by Government in the coming months and in light of the budgetary context. </p><p>Development of the Strategy is a priority for me and for my Department, and I will move to publish the Strategy later this year. </p><p>Given the importance of these first five years for childhood development and for development over the life course, this Strategy offers considerable potential to transform the lives of young children and their families over the next decade.</p></reply>

Primarily, Pobal - in their capacity as administrators of the ECCE programme - provide a comprehensive annual overview of the Early Years Sector and report their findings through the Early Years Sector Profile report. This report provides an accurate overview of childcare places regionally and nationally in three categories; namely, the number of children enrolled on ECCE, the number of children on a waiting list for ECCE (if any) and the number of vacant places by Service Provider. In addition, both Pobal and the DCYA Operations team collect and review statistical data regarding the take up of ECCE places, on a weekly basis, while the Department of Education and Skills also provides my Department with demographic information to assist in the identification of potential demand pressure points. </p>  <p>  My Department has considered the available information and is satisfied ECCE provision will be sufficient for the 2017-2018 programme year. ECCE providers have catered for over 121,968, children for this period, and while there can be pressures in some immediate localities; all eligible children have been catered for. We also work very closely with the local area CCCs, and to date no shortage of places has been reported. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth noting that my Department provided &euro;8.4 million of funding in 2017 through the Early Years Capital Programme. This programme assisted in alleviating pressures in respect of the availability of ECCE places, in certain areas, through the funding of expansion projects. </p></reply>

Once an individual Branch Manager accepts these proposals in writing, the new remuneration proposal will be put in place for that individual Branch Manager.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Meetings are held with the key stakeholder interest groups, the Royal Canal Amenity Group, Inland Waterways Association of Ireland (IWAI) and the Heritage Boat Association (HBA).</p>  <p>  In addition, Waterways Ireland works alongside the Friends of the Grand Canal and Royal Canal Clean-Up Group in Dublin and the newly established Grand Canal Dock Group, who like many of the communities throughout the waterways support the maintenance and operation of the canals.</p>  <p>  Operational staff, lockkeepers and waterway patrollers meet canal users on a daily basis and provide a wide range of services.  Inspectorate staff manage boat use on the canals in accordance with the 1988 Canal Bye-laws.  In this regard, Waterways Ireland continues to concentrate on boats which consistently remain in breach of the Bye-laws.  Where a boat owner fails to respond to requests to comply, after notification by letters, telephone calls and formal notice, a programme of boat removal continues.</p>  <p>  In Grand Canal Dock where boat owners have refused to move, and are seeking to permanently reside on their vessels in breach of the Bye-laws, Regulation of use of these prime location berths is being taken forward under the 1988 Canal Bye-laws to protect these public amenities.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland in 2018 will deliver a programme to extend boat effluent pump out facilities and fresh water locations for boat owners using the canal network. Waterways Ireland will also extend its programme of promoting and ensuring compliance with the use of holding tanks for effluent in boats on the Canal network.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Bill does not  make provision to increase the charges for boat users on the canals.  The amendments to the Canals Act, 1986 in the Heritage Bill are primarily enabling provisions to allow for the making of bye laws to regulate boating on the canals and to manage the use of the canals. Waterways Ireland will bring forward changes in new Bye Laws proposals once the Heritage Bill is enacted. </p></reply>
