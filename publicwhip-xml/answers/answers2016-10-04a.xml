While not all these issues relate to the Constitution, the Citizen's Assembly will be asked to make recommendations to the D&aacute;il on the Eighth Amendment, on fixed-term parliaments and on the manner in which referendums are held.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government also says that on foot of the recommendation of the Banking Inquiry, the Government will seek a review of the powers of Oireachtas Committees in conducting inquiries and, based on this review, will consider whether there should be a Constitutional referendum to strengthen Committees' powers.</p><p>As regards timing, no decision has been made on this as yet.  I should add that before any referendum would be scheduled, I would of course bring a proposal to Government and hold discussions with Opposition Leaders.</p></reply>

I can, however, assure you that the provision of a new site for the school is a priority for the Department and that the patron body will be informed of the location for the school as soon as it is possible to do so.</p></reply>

It is a matter for Caranua's Board and executive to manage its activities and to put in place systems and processes that are appropriate having regard to the organization's statutory remit.</p><p>I would like to point out that, up to the end of June 2016, Caranua had spent some &euro;50 million in supports to or on behalf of 3,545 applicants.  A significant level of funding has been provided to a large number of former residents which is to be welcomed.</p><p>I understand that Caranua takes all complaints seriously and that it has a Customer Service Charter and Feedback and Complaints Policy which may be accessed on the organisation's website (<i><i>www.caranua.ie</i></i><i>)</i>.  The website allows applicants to provide feedback, submit comments and make formal complaints in cases where there is dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided.  Furthermore, Caranua comes within the scope of the Ombudsman Acts 1980 to 2012 and its administrative actions are subject to review by the Ombudsman. It is worth noting also that Caranua is amenable to scrutiny by the Oireachtas, including its committees. </p><p>I understand that as part of the applications process there are extensive levels of communications between Caranua and applicants.  Each applicant is assigned an Application Advisor who is responsible for guiding an applicant through the applications process, helping them to identify the full range of needs they have and providing them with any supporting information that may be needed to complete the application.  While there have been delays in the past, I am not aware of there being significant delays in the application process at present.  If the Deputy is aware of a particular case where there has been an inordinate delay in the processing of an individual application I would encourage her to raise the matter directly with Caranua.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the number of classroom teaching posts allocated to each school is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  </p>  <p>  However, the staffing arrangements also include a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent classroom posts for the coming school year, on developing school grounds.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy has been approved for 1 additional classroom post on this developing school criteria for the 2016/17 school year.  This post is subject to the school achieving projected enrolments on 30 September 2016.  </p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are managed at local school level.  My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account, for example, available classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolments etc.  School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p></reply>

The Bill is a priority listing on the current legislative programme and I hope the Bill will move to second stage shortly and Committee Stage later in this term.</p><p>The second and subsequent stages of the Bill will provide an opportunity for detailed examination of the provisions of the Bill as it passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

Options in both of these areas are under review.  </p><p>A major objective set out in the Action Plan for Education is to increase by 30% entrants from groups which have traditionally low participation in higher education.  Any future funding model will need to deliver on this and other objectives for our higher education system. </p><p>My Department provides a suite of supports that are intended to assist students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and other under-represented groups, to overcome financial barriers to accessing and completing higher education. </p><p>In 2015/16 my Department spent &euro;414million on such financial supports. </p><p>More than 80,000 students were supported under the Student Grant Scheme last year, at a cost of approximately &euro;380 million.  A similar number of students will benefit this academic year. </p><p>Some 15,000 students were assisted in 2015/16 through the Student Assistance Fund, at a cost of &euro;6.34m. </p><p>In addition, 10,500 students were provided with additional supports through the Fund for Students with Disabilities, at a cost of &euro;10.4m. </p><p>My Department also provides scholarships and bursaries to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July, clearly outlines the funding challenges in the higher education sector and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, I have referred the report to the Education Committee as part of the process for formulating a plan for the future of the sector.  This will ensure that all views can be heard and considered. </p>  <p>  In welcoming the publication of the report I indicated my belief that additional funding for the sector must be accompanied by new performance based funding mechanisms and new targets for improved outcomes for the users and funders of the service. </p>  <p>  We will require reasonable consensus to enable us to move forward with a realistic and achievable strategy for funding the system into the future.  I shall work with the Education Committee as it analyses all of the options put forward by the Expert Group and hears the voice of all stakeholders and all sides of the debate. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is working with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on a revised System Performance Framework of strategic dialogue with higher education institutions which will establish clear goals for the system for the next 5 years across priority areas such as access, research and developing our pipeline of human capital.  My Department, in co-operation with the HEA, is also undertaking a review of current state funding mechanisms to ensure the right tools and incentives are in place to achieve these goals.</p></reply>

It is regrettable that ASTI seem determined to pursue a route of confrontation rather than dialogue.</p>  <p>  In respect of issues relating to the reform of the Junior Certificate, a key element of the new Framework are Classroom Based Assessments (CBAs).  These assessments will be undertaken by students across the junior cycle, one in 2nd year and one in 3rd year.  The second CBA will be followed by a written Assessment Task which will be externally marked by the State Examinations Commission.  The Assessment Task is worth 10% of the marks for the final examination.</p>  <p>  Earlier grounds for objection of the ASTI to the new Framework have been addressed.  Under the 2015 Framework agreed with the unions, teachers are now not involved in assessing their own students for State certification purposes.</p>  <p>  However, teachers of English who are members of ASTI have been directed by their union that, while they are to teach the new specification, they are not to undertake the Classroom Based Assessments (CBAs) with their students.  Therefore, students who are taught by a teacher who is a member of the ASTI will not receive a grade for their CBAs.  Since the second CBA is linked to the written Assessment Task these students cannot complete the Assessment Task.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently met with the ASTI on this matter, where the position regarding the written Assessment Task was made very clear.  In cases where the Assessment Task is not completed the State Examinations Commission cannot award any marks in respect of this mandatory component.  Therefore, candidates for Junior Cycle English in 2017 who do not complete the assessment task can only be marked and graded based on a maximum of 90% of the available marks.</p>  <p>  Given the very unfair position in which the ASTI directive now places teachers and students of English, my Department asked ASTI to provide an immediate derogation from their directive for current teachers of English, while talks on the Junior Cycle proceed, in order that current third year English students of ASTI members are no longer unfairly and unjustifiably disadvantaged.  The ASTI have yet to respond on this request.</p></reply>

SOLAS and the Apprenticeship Council are preparing a detailed 3 year plan to deliver on this commitment, which will include managing the pipeline of new apprenticeships and setting out the timing and nature of new calls for proposals.  This plan will be published shortly and will set out specific annual targets as well as bringing forward a range of specific actions to enable and support the development of new apprenticeships and traineeships.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development.</p>  <p>  The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, the first of the new programmes developed through the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s call for proposals, launched in September.  This will be followed by the Industrial Engineer Apprenticeship due to launch this month.  Further new apprenticeships are scheduled to launch later this year/early next year in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the route to an apprenticeship is through gaining employment with an approved employer.  A campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners including the Apprenticeship Council.  The campaign will raise awareness and promote the value of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to ensure that we have high quality teaching and a safe school environment for all students.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that the Teaching Council does not pay or withdraw payment from teachers.  Teacher salaries are paid by my Department or by Education and Training Boards (ETBs), as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The position is that Section 30 of the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 provides that a person who is employed as a teacher in a recognised school, but who is not on the register of teachers, shall not be remunerated in respect of his or her employment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, other than in exceptional circumstances where, even though the employing school or ETB has made every effort, a registered teacher cannot be found to take up the position.  Statutory Instrument 32/2014 governs such circumstances.</p>  <p>  Section 34 of the Teaching Council Acts makes provision for a situation where a registered teacher fails to apply for renewal of his/her registration in accordance with the Acts (section 33).  In that case the Teaching Council is required to inform the teacher and the teacher is retained on the register for a further month.  If his or her application is still not received he or she is then removed from the register.  The Deputy may wish to note also that, routinely, a number of attempts are made by the Council to contact a teacher, including by post, phone and text where the contact details are available to the Council, before the teacher is removed from the register.</p></reply>

These are the 33 hours of additional work per year (less than one hour per week) that were agreed under the Croke Park agreement, to facilitate staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, etc., without closing schools.  ASTI's decision to withdraw from these hours means that the union has repudiated the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to fully implementing the Lansdowne Road Agreement in accordance with the timelines agreed, subject to the continued cooperation of the unions.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement remains the framework for public service pay.  It is the only framework available for managing the needs of the public service while implementing the reforms that enable us to deliver better public services in the future.</p>  <p>  In opting to withdraw from the LRA, ASTI members are also opting to forego a series of benefits and protections.  These include avoiding an increment freeze, continuation of the alleviation of the FEMPI Act 2013 pay cut for higher earners, the addition of the &euro;1,592 Supervision and Substitution allowance to the pay scale and protection against compulsory redundancy.</p>  <p>  Further significant consequences of withdrawing from the Lansdowne Road Agreement are the withdrawal of the benefits introduced under the Ward Report and the non-application of the revised sequence for the filling of posts/hours, both of which measures enable new teachers to gain permanent employment and full hours more quickly than before.  In addition, newly qualified ASTI members will not receive the benefits of the recent agreement reached with TUI and INTO on new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  I previously offered that my Department would suspend the implementation of measures associated with ASTI&rsquo;s repudiation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement, if the union suspends their directive to withdraw from the Croke Park hours.  This would provide a more constructive context for talks to take place and would avoid disruption in schools.  It would also mean that thousands of ASTI teachers would receive the payment for supervision and substitution as well as other benefits and protections under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Unfortunately, ASTI have refused this offer thus far but it remains open.</p>  <p>  Despite this, my Department is making arrangements to continue the ongoing discussions with ASTI in relation to their issues of concern.  I believe that continuing dialogue between my Department and the ASTI would be in the best interests of schools, parents, students and teachers as is evidenced by the agreements reached with the INTO and TUI.  It is regrettable that ASTI seem determined to pursue a route of confrontation rather than dialogue.</p></reply>

These are the 33 hours of additional work per year (less than one hour per week) that were agreed under the Croke Park agreement, to facilitate staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, etc., without closing schools.  ASTI's decision to withdraw from these hours means that the union has repudiated the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to fully implementing the Lansdowne Road Agreement in accordance with the timelines agreed, subject to the continued cooperation of the unions.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement remains the framework for public service pay.  It is the only framework available for managing the needs of the public service while implementing the reforms that enable us to deliver better public services in the future.</p>  <p>  In opting to withdraw from the LRA, ASTI members are also opting to forego a series of benefits and protections.  These include avoiding an increment freeze, continuation of the alleviation of the FEMPI Act 2013 pay cut for higher earners, the addition of the &euro;1,592 Supervision and Substitution allowance to the pay scale and protection against compulsory redundancy.  Further significant consequences of withdrawing from the Lansdowne Road Agreement are the withdrawal of the benefits introduced under the Ward Report and the non-application of the revised sequence for the filling of posts/hours, both of which measures enable new teachers to gain permanent employment and full hours more quickly than before.  In addition, newly qualified ASTI members will not receive the benefits of the recent agreement reached with TUI and INTO on new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  I previously offered that my Department would suspend the implementation of measures associated with ASTI&rsquo;s repudiation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement, if the union suspends their directive to withdraw from the Croke Park hours.  This would provide a more constructive context for talks to take place and would avoid disruption in schools.  It would also mean that thousands of ASTI teachers would receive the payment for supervision and substitution as well as other benefits and protections under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Unfortunately, ASTI have refused this offer thus far - but it remains open to them.</p>  <p>  I believe that continuing dialogue between my Department and the ASTI would be in the best interests of schools, parents, students and teachers as is evidenced by the agreements reached with the INTO and TUI.  It is regrettable that ASTI seem determined to pursue a route of confrontation rather than dialogue.  Despite this, my Department is making arrangements to continue the ongoing discussions with ASTI in relation to their issues of concern.</p></reply>

In this regard, Prime Minister May&rsquo;s comments over the weekend are welcome.  We now have some clarity about the timeline for the process. </p>  <p>  Article 50 will provide the framework for withdrawal negotiations.  At a meeting of 27 EU Heads of State or Government in Brussels on 29 June, we agreed a number of principles, including that no negotiations should take place until the UK Government has formally triggered Article 50: this remains the case. </p>  <p>  We expect that, further to Prime Minister May&rsquo;s announcement, work will now step up at EU level to prepare for the triggering of Article 50 by next March at the latest.  Ireland will remain centrally involved in these efforts in order to best defend and promote our interests.</p>  <p>  Separate negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU will also need to take place: here, we still await clarification from the UK government as to what type of relationship it will seek.  As I have stated on previous occasions, from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we would like the UK to have as close a relationship with the EU as possible, once it is no longer a Member State. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the period ahead remain unchanged.  In all negotiations, the Government will seek to ensure that the best possible outcomes can be achieved for our citizens, for our economy, for Northern Ireland and for the Common Travel Area.</p>  <p>  Work will continue to intensify across Government in the weeks and months ahead to achieve those objectives.  It is important to remember that our preparations have been ongoing for over twelve months and that we have already progressed much important work, particularly in relation to contingency planning.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to note that, until it formally withdraws from the European Union, the UK remains a full Member State, with all the existing rights and obligations that membership confers.  </p></reply>

The Committee will oversee the overall Government response, including both the economic impact and the negotiations at EU level and with the administrations in London and Belfast.  This will be supported in its work by a Senior Officials Group on BREXIT which will build on the work which was undertaken by the Inter Departmental Group on EU/UK Affairs.</p><p>A Second Secretary General has been appointed to lead a new integrated division within my Department with responsibility for EU, Northern Ireland, British-Irish and International affairs.</p><p>The appointment is part of a series of actions I announced following the referendum.  This includes the strengthening of the EU policy role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as well as the strengthening of other key Departments, agencies and overseas missions.</p><p>This will be complemented by existing structures.  They include: the Cabinet Committee on EU Affairs and the EU Senior Officials Group which supports it; and a consultative group of external stakeholders, including ICTU, IBEC and other business representative groups and relevant NGOs. </p><p>In anticipation of Article 50 being triggered in early 2017, all Departments have been examining all possible models for the future UK relationship with the EU, from continued membership of the single market to a full exit of the customs union.</p><p>As well as intensifying analysis of the risks associated with Brexit, Government Departments are also working to identify opportunities that may arise.  </p><p>This includes inward investment opportunities and relocation of EU bodies currently located in the UK.  Sector-by-sector work in this area continues, with for example potential scientific/R&amp;amp;D opportunities being closely pursued by Science Foundation Ireland. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are in close contact with their clients on the challenges and opportunities presented by the referendum result.  They have also extended their schedule of Trade Missions.</p><p>The IDA will continue to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for investment and talent and will seek to maximise opportunities that might arise.  This is based on our unique competitive strengths and our position as an English-speaking country in Europe and in the eurozone.</p><p>Government will also continue to implement our clear strategy for driving growth in the financial services sector.</p></reply>

Persons who are currently in another EU Member State, including those in the camps in Calais, and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so. We also need to bear in mind that a defining characteristic of the people in Calais, including unaccompanied minors, has been their very strong desire to go to the UK as their ultimate destination and that this is unlikely to change.  In that respect I do not see that a unilateral initiative from Ireland would be appropriate in this case, not least given the fact that this is a delicate situation involving the borders between two other Member States. </p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  With regard to unaccompanied minors Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year.  Tusla - the Child and Family Agency with responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State - will travel to Greece to assess the needs of those minors and plan for their care and accommodation upon arrival.</p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's concerns in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group and I expect this issue to remain high on the agenda at EU level. </p></reply>

Deployment of a reserve member is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Reserve Members) Regulations 2006 which states that a Reserve member shall be placed on duty under the supervision of a member of another rank. </p>  <p>  The Garda Reserve performs policing duties as determined by the Garda Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;.  The role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas.  Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;.  In recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to double the Reserve along with other commitments to further accelerate recruitment to reach a target of 15,000 Garda&iacute; and to further increase the number of civilians.  In the context of the planned expansion of the Reserve it is important that consideration is given to optimising its use and I expect that the audit of the skills and experience of reserve members being undertaken at present by the Garda Reserve Management Office established by the Commissioner will inform consideration of the future role of the Reserve including whether additional powers should be conferred on reserve members. </p></reply>

I would reiterate for the Deputy that these are entirely operational matters for the Garda Authorities, to be carried out in accordance with their functions as set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts, and neither I nor my Department would be involved in such arrangements.</p>  <p>  As I have set out previously to the House, it is the advice of the Garda Authorities that assistance from police services from other jurisdictions is a recognised and necessary tactic for managing circumstances where persons from outside the jurisdiction who are unknown to local police may seek to foment or engage in violent protest actions here.  Any such arrangements are a matter for operational decisions made between the police services involved and must, of course, operate in accordance with the law.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise the point I made previously that there can be no question of any person being permitted to engage in criminal activities here in any circumstances.  Any evidence of criminality would be pursued fully the Garda Authorities.  There is no question of a police officer from outside the jurisdiction exercising police powers here - by that is meant that an officer from a police service other than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot exercise the powers available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of fulfilling the functions for which they have responsibility under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts.</p></reply>

Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.</p>  <p>  In September 2015, I published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, as approved by Government.  The Bill provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. </p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.</p>  <p>  The Bill has completed all stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and is scheduled for consideration at Second Stage before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 5 October 2016.</p></reply>

As well as the above document, a series of guideline notes, outlining how the new immigration regime operates, are also available on the INIS website, including information on maximum time limits for students who wish to study at Language Non Degree Level and Degree Level.

This Part, comprising sections 7 to 36, deals with the establishment of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its membership, appointment, functions, staffing and other matters including disqualification or removal from membership.  The Authority comprises eleven members of whom a majority, including the Chairperson, are to be lay persons.  While members of the new Regulatory Authority are duly appointed by the Government under these procedures, under section 9 (2)(a) of the 2015 Act, a resolution approving such appointment has first to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The relevant procedures set out in Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 are being adhered to as regards the nomination by the nominating bodies designated in the Act and the approval and appointment of members of the new Regulatory Authority.  For example, resolutions of both Houses approving members of the Authority were passed in July with resolutions concerning one remaining nominee being considered for approval by the Houses this week.</p>  <p>  By way of ensuring the new Authority&rsquo;s independence of appointment and the desired balance in its representation of the interests of lawyers and those of consumers of legal services, all of the potential members of the new Authority are put forward, subject to stated criteria, by those prescribed nominating bodies set out in section 9 of the 2015 Act.  Each of these bodies puts forward their nominees as identified by them under their own selection procedures.  They do this as appropriate to their functions and objectives as may be set out, in each case, under legislation or under common law.  It will, therefore, be for those bodies, in the first instance, to resolve any alleged breach of process that may arise under their applicable internal governance procedures. </p>  <p>  Section 12 of the Legal Services Act 2015 sets out a number of circumstances in which the Government may remove a member of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority from office by reference to ill health, stated misbehaviour, conflict of interest or being otherwise unfit to hold the office or unable to discharge its functions.  This section also sets out the procedures for such a removal including notification of the member and of the nominating body concerned and the provision of a statement of the reasons for the proposal to remove the member.  It also allows the member or nominating body concerned a period to make representations as to why the member should not be removed from office.  When, having taken account of these matters, the Government decide to remove a member, they shall notify the member and the nominating body concerned subject to possible appeal to the High Court which may, as it thinks proper, either affirm or overturn the decision concerned.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that all claims for travel and subsistence by judges are validated by the Courts Service and paid in accordance with rates sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and are in compliance with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regulations.  The validation system ensures that the highest possible standards of accuracy and compliance with regulations are applied in the processing and payment of claims for judicial expenses.  Travel and subsistence expenses claims are vouched, where required by regulations, and are subject to audit. </p>  <p>  Information on travel and subsistence expenses incurred by judges is published on the Courts Service website on a six monthly basis.  The figures relates to travel and subsistence, judicial attire and incidental expenses claimed by judges of all jurisdictions during the six month period and claims can also be made in respect of expenses incurred in previous periods.  The travel and subsistence costs for judges arise mainly from the constitutional requirement that Courts sit across the country in each Circuit Court Circuit and District Court District and the total amount is determined by the number of court sittings and the number of judges assigned, both of which have increased in recent years.  The High Court also sits outside Dublin as required.</p></reply>

Persons who are currently in another EU Member State, including those in the camps in Calais, and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so.  We also need to bear in mind that a defining characteristic of the people in Calais, including unaccompanied minors, has been their very strong desire to go to the UK as their ultimate destination and that this is unlikely to change.  In that respect I do not see that a unilateral initiative from Ireland would be appropriate in this case, not least given the fact that this is a delicate situation involving the borders between two other Member States. </p><p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian  crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  With regard to unaccompanied minors Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year.  Tusla - the Child and Family Agency with responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State - will travel to Greece to assess the needs of those minors and plan for their care and accommodation upon arrival.</p><p>I share the Deputy's concerns in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group and I expect this issue to remain high on the agenda at EU level. <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

You will appreciate that the liquidation of an insurance company is a legally complex and time consuming process.  In general terms, under the Statute of Limitations, claimants are given two years following an accident to make an initial claim. </p><p>It should be noted that the decision to appoint a Provisional Liquidator to Enterprise on 25 July 2016 does not terminate or cancel contracts of insurance.  However, claims under such contracts  will not be paid until the assets and liabilities of the company have been ascertained which means it could take several years for some cases to be settled.</p><p>As of 3rd October 2016, the website of Enterprise Insurance states that a hearing has been set for 26 October at which the Provisional Liquidator will report to the Supreme Court of Gibraltar.  The Provisional Liquidator will recommend that a liquidator be appointed and then it will be a matter for the Court to decide whether it agrees with such an appointment.</p><p>Persons who have a query or a claim should contact their broker or Enterprise on telephone number 00 350 200 50150 or<i>info@eigplc.com. </i></p><p>In relation to your query regarding whether persons may resort to the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, the High Court has issued a decision in the Law Society of Ireland v The Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland case to the effect that the MIBI's liability under the 2009 Agreement extended to situations of insurer insolvency (subject to each individual claim being deemed eligible) and that decision was endorsed by the Court of Appeal.  The case is currently the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court however and is, therefore, sub judice.  That appeal is due to be heard on 24 October 2016. </p><p>The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) provides for payments to meet the liabilities of insolvent insurers in certain cases where it is unlikely that claims can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  Management and administration of the ICF is under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  Under the Insurance Act 1964, in a liquidation all ICF payments are subject to a limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  In addition, claims by bodies corporate or unincorporated bodies are not covered by the ICF, except where there is a liability to or by an individual.  </p></reply>

This was a high level discussion with presentations from a number of guest speakers such as Mr Mario Monti and Mr Andres Borg. </p>  <p>  At this meeting I outlined that Ireland's consistent position on the economic governance reforms is that the focus should be on full and effective implementation of the reforms already enacted which are still bedding down rather than trying to develop and put in place new structures and institutions.  As I see it, the economic governance framework of the Economic and Monetary Union has been subject to major changes in recent years.  The effects of these changes still has to be fully worked through and understood.  Given the importance of the financial sector, it is fundamental that the remaining components of the Banking Union is completed. </p>  <p>  The value of the Euro was not discussed at the Informal Ecofin meeting on 9-10 September; nor was it discussed at the Eurogroup meeting on 9 September. </p></reply>

For example, Sections 76, 78, 207 and 208 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) provide an exemption (Charitable Tax Exemption) to registered charities or trusts in respect of Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT), Dividend Withholding Tax and Stamp Duties in certain circumstances.  To qualify for the exemption a charity or trust must satisfy Revenue that it has a proper legal structure in place, is constituted and operated exclusively for charitable purposes and has a Governing Instrument setting out the objectives of the organisation in a manner that clearly demonstrates its charitable purpose.  There are currently in excess of 8,000 individual charities or trusts availing of the Charitable Tax Exemption.  The full list can be accessed at link: . </p><p>Section 235 of the TCA provides an exemption to bodies established for the promotion of athletic or amateur games or sports, for example GAA clubs, soccer clubs, rugby clubs, in respect of Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Stamp Duty. </p><p>Section 848A of the TCA provides for a scheme of tax relief for donations to eligible charities and other 'approved bodies' such as educational and human rights bodies.  The Charitable Donations Scheme is designed to incentivise individuals and corporate entities to donate funds in a 'tax efficient manner' that can result in the charities/approved bodies benefitting on a gross basis rather than a net basis.  There are currently 2,408 charities or approved bodies holding authorisation to avail of the Charitable Donations Scheme.  The full list can be accessed at link:<b></b><i>.</i></p><p>There are also a number of Value-Added Tax Refund Orders that provide for VAT refunds to voluntary organisations in certain circumstances.  Examples in this regard are refunds of VAT incurred on, vehicles used to transport severely and permanently disabled persons, sea and inland waterways rescue craft, ancillary equipment and special boat buildings used in connection with rescue and assistance at sea or inland waterways, qualifying medical equipment purchased through voluntary donations and humanitarian goods which are exported for use in humanitarian, charitable and teaching activities abroad.  </p></reply>

Special housing needs in this context could include the elderly, people with disabilities or victims of domestic violence. </p>  <p>  Where a property owned by an Approved Housing Body is not exempt from LPT, Section 17 (6) of the Act provides that the lowest Valuation Band (&euro;0 to &euro;100,000) applies.

The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.   </p>  <p>  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case by case basis.   </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland, which represents the insurance industry in Ireland, has informed me that motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the age of the driver, the type of car, the claims record, driving experience, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market and consumers are free to choose.  Insurance companies price in accordance with their own past claims experience, for example, where the age of a car is a factor, different insurance companies would use different age thresholds. </p>  <p>  Policy in relation to the National Car Test (NCT) lies with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Specifically with regard to the NCT, it was introduced to comply with an EU Roadworthiness Testing Directive aimed at improving road safety and environmental protection.  It goes beyond the current Directive's requirements in many areas and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is of the view that the Irish system is one of the best roadworthiness testing regimes in the EU. </p>  <p>  While the NCT is one component of having safer vehicles on our roads, every vehicle owner has a personal and legal responsibility to ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy and well maintained.  The NCT is an inspection or general 'health check' of what is visible and accessible on the day of the test and includes a check of the roadworthiness of such safety features, amongst others, as lighting, brakes and tyres. </p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on a review of policy in the insurance sector which is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments and Agencies.  The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.   </p>  <p>  As part of that Review, the Cost of Insurance Working Group is examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  This work includes an examination as to why there is no direct link between the NCT and the availability of insurance. </p>  <p>  Finally, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  In the event that a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland, 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1, Telephone +353 1 6761820, quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.</p></reply>

As a result, there is no robust basis on which to cost such a measure. </p>  <p>  I would however point out that a flat rate tax of 30% as described in Deputy Collins' question would result in an increase in taxation for some earners due to the availability of tax credits and the standard rate band.  For example, single employees paying Class A Employee PRSI currently have an effective tax rate of less than 30% where their income does not exceed &euro;55,000. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Deputies may recall that I examined proposals last year relating to incentives for returning emigrants, and decided not to proceed with such measures in view of their potential to distort the labour market and to place existing Irish-resident workers at a disadvantage.  It is also likely that any such measure targeted specifically at returning Irish emigrants would be in breach of the freedom of movement principles of the European Treaties.</p>  <p>  For these reasons, I was not then, and am not now, minded to provide for a relief along the lines suggested.  </p>  <p>  In the Programme for Partnership Government there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the Universal Social Charge (USC), as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefits for high earners.  Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners, including workers recently returned or arrived in the State.  I believe that these changes will act to make Ireland a more attractive proposition, from an income tax perspective, for all income earners, including those Irish emigrants that may wish to return home.</p></reply>

The current rate applied to such late payments is 8% per annum (0.0219% per day).  This rate also applies to Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Capital Acquisition Tax, Local Property Tax and Stamp Duty.  The interest rate applied to all other taxes, for example PAYE/PRSI and VAT is 10% per annum (0.0274% per day).    </p>  <p>   These statutory charges, which Revenue is obliged to apply, are designed to compensate the Exchequer for the late payment of monies due and to maintain a level playing field for the vast majority of taxpayers and businesses that meet their tax obligations in full and on time.  The application of interest charges to the late payment of tax is well established as a core strategy for ensuring timely compliance by all sectors, including the self-employed, and I have no plans to review it at this time.  The onus is on all taxpayers and businesses, assisted by their agents or tax practitioners, to organise their financial affairs to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due thereby avoiding interest charges. </p>  <p>  While Revenue is obliged to collect all tax and interest liabilities as they fall due, it recognises that despite the best efforts of normally complaint taxpayers, including the self-employed and small businesses, difficulties can arise that result in failure to meet tax payment obligations.  In such scenarios Revenue s overall approach is to work with the taxpayers to overcome these difficulties, including in appropriate cases agreeing to phased payment arrangements.  This strategy has worked well over many years and Revenues' ongoing commitment in this regard is clearly evidenced by the almost 8,500 phased arrangements covering &euro;96m of debt that it currently has in place with taxpayers experiencing cash flow difficulties. </p></reply>

These governance requirements set out the role and responsibilities of two key positions within the credit union - those of chair of the board and the manager of the credit union.  Section 64 of the Credit Union Act 1997 identifies the treasurer as the 'managing director' of the credit union and his/her responsibilities included executive responsibilities such as submitting financial statements to the board.  In order to ensure that the role and responsibilities of board and management do not overlap and that board members have governance rather than executive responsibilities, the Commission recommended that the 1997 Act be amended to remove the role of treasurer and assign executive responsibilities to the management of the credit union.  This recommendation was reflected in section 21 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012.  Having regard to the foregoing, I have no plans at this time to introduce such an amendment for credit unions. </p>  <p>  More generally, in terms of board composition and competence and capability, under the Credit Union Act, 1997 the board of directors of a credit union must be of sufficient number and expertise to adequately oversee the operations of the credit union while the nomination committee must review the composition of the board for the purpose of identifying any deficiencies.  In addition, under the Fitness and Probity Regime for credit unions, a credit union must not permit a person to perform a Controlled Function (which includes all members of the board) unless it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person is, amongst other things, competent and capable to perform their role. </p></reply>

Section 35 also states that a credit union shall manage and control lending to ensure the making of loans does not involve undue risk to members' savings taking into account the nature, scale, complexity and risk profile of the credit union.  The Central Bank has indicated that all applications for credit should be appropriately assessed to ensure that the applicant's financial position, including commitments to other financial institutions is fully disclosed.  Advancing credit to individuals who do not have the capacity to repay does not assist those individuals but can potentially exacerbate their difficulties.</p>  <p>  In November 2015 the Personal Microcredit Scheme was launched as a pilot scheme in 30 credit unions on a voluntary basis and is now being made available to all credit unions.  The initiative was first developed by bodies with an interest in social finance and these later joined an implementation group which included the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the Department of Social Protection and credit union representative bodies.  The main purpose of the Personal Microcredit Scheme is to provide small loan amounts, of between &euro;500 and &euro;2,000, to financially excluded people whose only other financial recourse would be to moneylenders. </p>  <p>  Separately, on 29 June 2016 the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) presented me with a Review of Implementation of the Recommendations in the Commission on Credit Unions Report.  This Review makes many recommendations, one of which is a full review of lending and concentration limits, including the basis of the calculation of those limits together with the associated liquidity requirements.  I have stated previously that I intend to implement all recommendations in CUAC's Report and to that purpose the main credit union representative bodies has each been invited to nominate an individual to participate in an Implementation Group to be established for one year, which will oversee, monitor and report regularly to me on implementation  of those recommendations. </p>  <p>  In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions subject to a lending restriction that are satisfied they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, could apply for a review of their lending restriction.  The closing date for receipt of applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative was 30 September 2015.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that as of July 2016, 26% of credit unions operate under lending restrictions, compared with 52% of credit unions at the start of the review process.  While 13 credit unions have a monthly maximum lending restriction imposed, almost all credit unions with a lending restriction in place have a maximum individual loan size restriction.  In the majority of cases, the maximum individual loan size is in excess of &euro;10,000.  The average new credit union loan in 2015 was &euro;3,400.   </p></reply>

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector.  The tourism sector is a key sector in the Irish Economy and the introduction of the 9% VAT rate was aimed at reducing costs during a very challenging time for the sector.  The objective was to boost tourism and create additional jobs.  While the VAT rate was due to revert to 13.5% in 2014, I retained the 9% rate on tourism activity in Budget 2014 because the initiative had proved to be a major success.  Between the second quarter of 2011 and first quarter of 2016, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of people working in the Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Services Sector nationally increased by 31,000, taking total employment from 114,900 to 145,900.  This increase of 27% compares to an increase of 7.2% in overall employment over the same period indicating that the measure may have been successful in terms of job creation and has made a significant impact on the competitiveness of the tourism product. </p>  <p>  The Government, in the Programme for Partnership Government, has committed to increasing revenue from overseas visitors, growing employment in the tourism sector and increasing the number of visits to Ireland, through the retention of the 9% VAT rate on tourism related services, among other measures, providing that prices remain competitive.  With reports of rising prices within the tourism sector, particularly in Dublin, it is incumbent on the industry to ensure that this relief continues to be passed through fully to the consumer.  My Department will continue to monitor developments in this regard.</p></reply>

Income averaging is an alternative method of arriving at the taxable profit figure for farmers using an average of 5 years.  The objective is to help to counteract the high volatility in income that is associated with the sector.</p>  <p>  The Agri-Tax review recommended retaining and enhancing the income averaging scheme, by extending the period of averaging from 3 to 5 years, in order to give more scope for income smoothing within a commodity price cycle.

To this end, all Government Departments as well as the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Programme for Government Office at the Department of the Taoiseach are being consulted and their views will be taken into consideration in preparation of the Strategy Statement, its strategic goals and underlying action plans for the coming years.  In developing our new Strategy Statement my Department is cognisant of the commitment of Government to equality evidenced by the many Programme for Government commitments that reflect this equality agenda and our new strategy will reference our Public Sector Duty.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance is committed to develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  Each year, the Department of Finance, independently and in conjunction with other Departments, conducts a number of analyses to examine the distributional impact of possible Budget options and of the final Budget package.  These provide an evidence base on equality issues which can be integrated alongside other budgetary considerations.  As a means of assessing this the Department carries out distributional analyses of budgetary options using the Economic and Social Research Institute's (ESRI) Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes (SWITCH) model. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, as part of the reformed Budget Process in 2016, papers were brought to the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) much earlier than was the case in previous years.  Included in the 2016 TSG Income Tax &amp;amp; USC paper are details of the distribution of the burden of these taxes, international comparisons, and analysis of potential impacts on different groups of a range of possible reforms.  The TSG papers were circulated to the Oireachtas Committees in July, well in advance of the Budget and facilitating the Committees in considering distributional issues.  They were subsequently published on the Department of Finance website. Overall, the analysis and transparency of the decision making process, as well as awareness and assessment of the impact of these decisions on different members of the population, has undergone constant improvement over recent years and continues to do so.</p></reply>

The system uses a range of data sources in carrying out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015, 13 new schools were announced to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018.</p>  <p>  The November 2015 announcement also detailed the new building projects and major extensions, including special schools, that will be progressed in areas where significant demographic need has been established.  In addition, the 6 Year Programme (2016-21) prioritises projects that in addition to meeting increases in enrolments, have a major deficit of mainstream accommodation capacity for current enrolments, require major refurbishment and replacement of poor accommodation.  School projects that were announced under my Department's 5 Year Plan (2012-16) will also be advanced in the Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  While all projects included in the Programme are based on the educational and demographic needs of the particular school and area, the decision of when exactly each individual school building project can proceed to tender and construction is based on a number of factors including the stage reached by the project in architectural planning, the level of overall funding available and the other contractual commitments and profiled expenditures extant under the Programme at that time.</p>  <p>   The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for smaller scale projects for schools, where an immediate accommodation requirement has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher.  In that regard, it is open to schools to apply for funding for additional classroom accommodation, where required.</p></reply>

The Plan was developed in close collaboration with industry.  The plan sets out a collaborative, system-wide response, across Departments, agencies and the education and enterprise sectors aimed at building the domestic supply of graduates from the education system and ensuring Ireland maintains a strong ICT talent pool and promoting Ireland internationally as a centre for high-level ICT skills.  Implementation of the Plan is underway, with oversight of a high level steering group comprising DES, DJEI and representatives from industry and the education sector. </p><p>A number of significant developments have taken place since the ICT Action Plan was published in 2014.  In 2015, my Department published the Digital Strategy for Schools and commenced work on the development of the Regional Skills Fora.

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as they operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment.</p>  <p>  SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage women to take up apprenticeships in these areas. Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers. 25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development.  The first of these new apprenticeships, the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, was launched last month with further new apprenticeships to be launched later this year and early next year.</p>  <p>  Many of these new apprenticeships are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Accompanying the renewal and expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign.  SOLAS will examine how this campaign can assist with promoting apprenticeship to women and to their potential employers.</p></reply>

Parents can view the range of courses which the Centre has available through the website <i>www.middletownautism.com.</i></p><p>The centre is a second tier service to complement existing provision for children with autism and it provides continuing professional development for schools and teachers and training courses for parents. It also has a research division.</p><p>At the request of this Department and as approved by the North South Ministerial Council, the Middletown Centre for Autism (MCA) commenced provision, on a limited pilot basis in the south, of an intensive educational assessment and learning support service to children on an outreach basis (MCA Pilot).</p><p>Where children with an ASD experience significant difficulties, the first course of action is engagement with first level services provided by the Department of Education and Skills (National Educational Psychological Service, Special Education Support Service, National Behavioural Support Service, National Council for Special Education) and Health Services Executive (HSE)/ HSE funded services.</p><p>The nominations and referral process is initiated at school level following a multi-disciplinary school based review involving NEPS, the local SENO and other relevant professionals.</p><p>Nominations to the MCA Referral Committee are considered for children where such a review concludes that despite comprehensive interventions and engagement with first-tier services, the child continues to present with significant and enduring behavioural and emotional difficulties.  The Centre has provided this service to 24 children and young people to date.</p><p>If a parent feels that a child is currently experiencing continuing difficulties they should request through their school a multi-disciplinary school based review involving NEPS, the local SENO and other relevant professionals.</p><p>In addition to the learning support and assessment service the centre also provides a training and a research and information service and in 2016-17 will provide 6325 training places for educational professionals and 6500 training places for parents (and siblings) in Ireland.  The research service will provide supportive resources for educational professionals and parents.</p><p>A joint evaluation of Middletown was undertaken in April 2016 and published on 30 August 2016.  The report highlights that the service provided by the Centre in the Republic of Ireland has resulted in significant benefits for pupils, families and schools. Key strengths of the Centre&rsquo;s involvement relate to the trans-disciplinary nature of the service, and the extent and duration of the Centre&rsquo;s involvement with pupils&rsquo; homes and schools simultaneously.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.  Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Any further enhancements to the Principal Release Time Scheme, will have to be considered in the context of the budgetary process.</p></reply>

These posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner.  The impact of the moratorium was therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.  There are limited alleviation arrangements in place for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level.</p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that the quality of school leadership is a key determinant of school effectiveness and the achievement of good learning outcomes.  Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning.</p>  <p>  The Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals.  It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders.  This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles.</p>  <p>  The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders.  Priorities for the Centre include a new post graduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals who are facing new challenges in the role, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards and the development of a quality assurance framework for leadership provision.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department has published Looking at Our School 2016, a quality framework for schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that as part of Budget 2016, additional release days for teaching principals were provided for, as outlined in circular 12/2016 which is available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The public consultation process will seek a wide range of views on this element of the new specification.</p>  <p>  In addition, a new specification in Junior Cycle Business Studies commenced in 2016.  It supports critical thinking skills and a statement of learning which requires that a student &lsquo;makes informed financial decisions and develops good consumer skills&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  At third level, a number of institutions have introduced modules on behavioural economics in recent years and there are research and postgraduate programmes in development.  In addition, UCD appointed a chair in Behavioural Economics in 2016.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, Universities and Institutes of Technology are autonomous bodies under the Universities Act 1997 and the Institutes of Technology Acts and, as such, have responsibility for their own academic affairs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, in its remit as the lead Department for the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES), is taking the policy lead in bringing a more coherent, planned and informed approach to the application of Behavioural Economics in the Irish public service.  The Department of Education and Skills, as a member of IGEES, contributes to the roll out and development of the work of the IGEES.</p></reply>

We are lucky in Ireland to have exceptionally strong school principals in disadvantaged schools &ndash; even small improvements in supports for and retention and performance of school leaders in these schools can have a dramatic impact on outcomes;</p><p>Networks and clusters for DEIS teachers and schools &ndash; including greater supported self-evaluation.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 made provision for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools in the current school year.  These posts provided for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhanced the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, improved the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and provided additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p>  <p>  At primary level a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule has been implemented for the 2016/17 school year.  The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils.  Lower thresholds apply for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, the 2016 budget provided an improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation from September 2016 for the purpose of enhancing guidance provision.  It brings the basis of allocation from 18.25:1 to 17.25:1 in DEIS schools and from 19:1 to 18.7:1 in other schools for the 2016/17 school year. </p>  <p>  The commitments in the Programme for Government, including the pupil-teacher ratio, will be considered in the context of the budgetary process.</p></reply>

The first of these new apprenticeships, the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, was launched last month with further new apprenticeships to be launched later this year and early next year.</p></reply>

The Strategy remains in force and as a result of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, its statutory role and influence has been strengthened by new requirements for local authority and regional plans to align with the NSS.</p><p>I intend that the new National Planning Framework will be a high-level nationally focused document, developed to ensure the optimal development of the country as a whole, while maximising Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and on-going growth at national, regional and local level.  It should contribute further to sustainable national recovery through an inclusive and participative approach with all relevant national, regional and local interests.  Furthermore, the Framework will act as the strategic planning context for relevant Government policies and capital investment planning in relation to housing, water services, transport, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure, as well as the preparations by the three new Regional Assemblies of their new regional spatial and economic strategies, and for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>In December 2015, the Government approved and published a roadmap for the preparation of the New National Planning Framework: this is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>The NPF &lsquo;roadmap&rsquo; outlines arrangements for the preparation of the NPF, which includes the establishment of a dedicated work team in my Department whose work will be overseen by a high-level cross-Departmental steering group supported by appropriate public consultation and stakeholder engagement arrangements.  Effective consultation will ensure that the Framework is built from the ground up, while at the same time taking account of strategic realities at national level.</p><p>In June 2016, my Department undertook a series of key stakeholder consultation events as an initial step in identifying a range of issues for consideration ahead of preparing the draft National Planning Framework.  This has provided an important building block to the consultation process and it is anticipated that the Stakeholder Consultation Report will be made available in the coming weeks.  This release will correspond with a formal national consultation programme which is currently being prepared and which will be an opportunity for all citizens to input their views and help to shape the NPF.</p><p>In addition, I am consulting with my colleagues in other Departments to inform the NPF in recognition of its whole-of-Government approach and impact and of the challenges and opportunities that exist to better align place-making, investment priorities, employment and environmental strategies. </p><p>It is intended that an emerging draft National Planning Framework will be prepared by early 2017. The framework will be submitted to the Oireachtas for approval in due course.</p></reply>

However, HAP recipients may access other forms of social housing supports, by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.</p>  <p>  On 16 December 2014, a statutory direction was issued to all authorities involved in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) statutory pilot, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefiting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through a transfer option.</p>  <p>  Local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.  In practice, housing authorities offer HAP recipients the opportunity to apply to go on the transfer list at the point when their HAP application is approved.  It is ultimately the choice of the HAP recipient to choose if they wish to be placed on a local authority&rsquo;s transfer list.  As of mid-September 2016, over 160 households have transferred from the HAP scheme to other forms of social housing support.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is a key Government priority.  The accelerated rollout of the scheme on a national basis is an important early action for completion under Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  Local authorities, including the local authorities in the Dublin Region, and my Department are working closely together in order to ensure the successful implementation of the scheme.  Rebuilding Ireland commits to the roll-out of the HAP scheme in the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and Fingal County Council in Q1 of 2017, subject to the necessary regulations being in place.  </p></reply>

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website <i>( www.pyriteboard.ie)</i>.</p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p><p>Given the scheme does not apply to dwellings which have a Damage Condition Rating of 1, the Board do not maintain records on the number of properties that fall into this category.  Nevertheless, the Board is aware that 7 dwellings, which had a Damage Condition Rating of 1 when their building condition assessments were first completed, and which were refused under the scheme, have now progressed to a Damage Condition Rating of 2; these dwellings have now been included in the pyrite remediation scheme following the submission of new applications.</p><p>In general terms, the cost of pyrite remediation is largely dependent on the dwelling type, the number of units in a project, the floor area of the dwellings, the depth of hardcore in the units and the presence or otherwise of under-floor heating systems.  Against this background, remediation costs can vary significantly and may not always be directly comparable across projects.  While my Department monitors overall expenditure under the scheme, the costs associated with individual projects are determined by on-going competitive procurement processes, which fall within the remit of the Housing Agency.  However the average cost of remediation having regard to those dwellings already remediated is some &euro;59,000, inclusive of the allowances provided under the scheme for alternative accommodation, furniture removal and storage and Building Condition Assessments.</p></reply>

CFRAMS data are used to measure risk and inform future decisions about the use of lands.  A CFRAM study does not address or recommend measures to mitigate risk.</p><p>The OPW is also the National Agency with responsibility for flood protection in Ireland, and has recently approved a flood relief scheme for Midleton.  The scheme is complex and challenging as the design solution must address a range of Pluvial, Fluvial, Groundwater and Tidal flooding issues.</p><p>Cork County Council was appointed as project lead for the scheme when funding was approved on 27 May 2016.  The Council immediately initiated the preparation of tender documentation to procure professional and technical supports for the design and delivery of the project.  Consultancy Tenders were advertised on 8 July 2016 and tenders are <i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i><i>due by 10/10/16.</i>Cork County Council is acting to appoint consultants and initiate Stage I (Scheme Development) by early 2017.</p><p>In this context there is no evidence that Cork County Council has ignored the recommendation of the CFRAM study in respect of planning decisions.  In relation to the locations mentioned by the Deputy:</p><p>T&iacute;r Cluain:</p><p>Planning permission was granted for 237 houses in 2005 prior to the availability of flood maps for the town and prior to the publication of the Guidelines on The Planning System and Flood Risk Management (published in 2009).

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period.  This ensures compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government and reaffirmed in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, I intend to undertake a review of the scheme in January 2017 following the first 12 months of operation. Following that review I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage.</p></reply>

All new buildings, including social housing units must comply with the legally enforceable minimum performance standards set out in the Building Regulations 1997 - 2014.  In this context, the Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010, and the accompanying (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements applicable to new buildings, and to existing buildings where new works, a material alteration or a material change of use is proposed. </p><p>The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability:</p><p>(a) new buildings other than dwellings (including multi-unit developments) are accessible and usable;</p><p>(b) extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable;</p><p>(c) material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;</p><p>(d) certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable; and</p><p>(e) new dwellings are visitable. </p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate. </p><p>While the latest iteration of Part M of the Building Regulations initially coincided with the general downturn in economic and construction activity, its positive effects on access and use in the built environment will now be seen more widely as economic recovery takes hold and construction activity continues to gather momentum and moves onto a sustainable footing.  While I have no proposals to amend Part M at this point in time, the Building Regulations, including Part M requirements, are subject to on-going review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p></reply>

The Implementation Monitoring Group will scope and frame the work-plan for its extension by the end of this year. </p><p>In addition, National Guidelines for the Assessment and Allocation Process for Housing Provision for People with a Disability were developed and adopted for implementation by housing authorities with effect from November 2014.  Furthermore, housing authorities have established Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs), chaired by each authority, which include representatives from the Health Services Executive and disability representative organisations.  The objective of these is to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with disabilities at a local level including, among other things, addressing accessibility requirements in new social housing stock.  A strategic plan for each county/city are a has been drawn up by the HDSGs to develop specific local strategies to meet identified and emerging needs.  These local Strategic Plans are currently being collated by the Housing Agency into a draft National Strategic Plan under the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness  .</p><p>The concept of Universal Design centres on achieving a built environment that can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of their age, size or disability.  All new buildings, including social housing units, must comply with the legally enforceable minimum performance standards set out in the Building Regulations 1997 - 2014. In this context, the , and the accompanying (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements applicable to new buildings, and to existing buildings where new works, a material alteration or a material change of use is proposed. </p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.  </p></reply>

The Plan sets out a practical and implementable set of actions to achieve the Government&rsquo;s goals to significantly increase and expedite the delivery of social housing units, boost private housing construction, improve the rental market, and deliver on the commitment to see housing supply, in overall terms, increase to some 25,000 new homes every year by 2020.</p><p>The Plan comprises five pillars of concerted actions right across Government and I can assure the Deputy that implementation of the Plan is well underway, including through local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, a new Housing Delivery Office within my Department, and a new Housing Procurement Unit and a One-Stop-Shop for Approved Housing Bodies within the Housing Agency.

The Action Plan, published on 19 July 2016, aims to deliver 47,000 units of social housing over the period to 2021 through construction, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, supported by Exchequer investment of some &euro;5.35 billion.</p><p>The Plan provides for early solutions to address the unacceptable level of families in emergency accommodation, including the objective that by mid-2017, hotels will only be used for emergency accommodation in very limited circumstances.  The increases in Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment levels from 1 July 2017, in terms of supporting families to remain in rented accommodation, will play an important role in the achievement of this overall objective.  However, where families do find themselves in a homeless situation, their needs will be met through the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment, general social housing allocations, the wider housing supply to be delivered through an expanded Rapid-Build housing programme and a Housing Agency initiative to acquire 1,600 vacant housing units. </p><p>The Action Plan also outlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure that services are fully responsive to the particular needs that might arise for families with children that are residing in emergency accommodation, with a number of measures to be overseen by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  These measures include the appointment of a Dedicated Child Support Worker, assistance by Home School Community Liaison and School Completion staff, and access to cr&egrave;ches and preschool services.</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan is available at<i>.</i></p></reply>

At 20 years old, the original site was showing its age.  For example, although it enabled jobseekers to search for job opportunities based on job type and location, it wasn&rsquo;t possible for employers to search for suitable jobseekers on the site; they had to rely on candidates finding and applying for a job from among the many thousands hosted on the system. </p><p>Accordingly, the Department issued a tender last year for the development and implementation of a new service that would enable both employers and jobseekers to search for each other using competencies and skillsets as well as the traditional job-type classifications.  As part of the new service, candidate profiles will be automatically matched to job specifications posted by employers with both candidate and the employer notified via email and/or SMS when a suitable match is found.  Candidates can also use the site to apply for the jobs advertised.  The system will also integrate with the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Intreo service and will include other new features such as allowing jobseekers to post CVs and video profiles if they wish.</p><p>Following the procurement process, the contract was awarded to a firm that is now building and delivering the new service from a base in Cork.  The service is being implemented on phased basis which means, unfortunately, that there is some service disruption while work is ongoing.  There have also been some teething problems with the first phase implementation as a result of which  the system is not working to specification.  The Department is working with the supplier to address these issues  improve add new functionality over the coming weeks.</p><p>Employers or any person experiencing difficulties with the website can contact the Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre on 1890 800 024 for assistance.

T&uacute;s helps to break the cycle of unemployment and improves a participant&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.  Currently, there are no circumstances under which a person&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s can be extended. </p>  <p>  The T&uacute;s budget for 2016 allows for 8,000 participants.  Extending the period of participation beyond one year for current participants would reduce the number of placements available to other people who are long-term unemployed.  This would deprive them of an opportunity to participate on the scheme.  I consider the existing 12-month placement period on T&uacute;s is appropriate for meeting the objectives of the initiative, while also ensuring that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from it.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The project was delivered by the Walkinstown Association for People with an Intellectual Disability (WALK). </p>  <p>  After the ending of ESF funding, as provided for in EU regulations, my Department understands that the WALK PEER project obtained additional funding from other sources.  As this additional funding terminated in July 2016, and following representations from WALK regarding funding difficulties relating to the PEER project, I decided to provide some short term funding to this project to enable it to continue service provision until early next year.</p>  <p>  Arising from the learning derived from the DACT projects, it is evident that there is a need for a continuum of services that provides people with disabilities with the appropriate supports to obtain employment and stay in work.  Consequently, there is also a need to enhance collaboration between service providers to ensure supports are delivered in a co-ordinated and structured manner.  To this end, a working group chaired by the NDA and comprising of the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Social Protection, together with the HSE was established to develop an effective co-ordinated policy approach and interdepartmental protocols to assist individuals with disabilities, including those who require a high level of support, to obtain and retain employment.  This working group is due to report by the end of the year with an implementation plan in this regard.  The provision of services at a national level, will be determined with reference to this implementation plan.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.  A yearly average of 48-52 weeks contributions is required to qualify for a 100% rate pension of &euro;233.30, and banded payments apply for those with lower yearly averages.  For example, where someone entered insurable employment aged 16 and had 2,000 weekly contributions (38.5 years) paid and/or credited, they would have a yearly average of 40, and would receive a pension at 98% of the full rate (for those in the 40-47 band).  People who qualify for lower band rates may, if they satisfy the means-test, qualify for the State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the State pension (contributory).  Where their spouse is in receipt of a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult, which maybe paid at up to 90% of the rate of a full pension (by default, this payment is made directly to the Qualified Adult).</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years after that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  The position of women who were home-makers will be considered very carefully in developing these proposals.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.  A yearly average of 48-52 weeks contributions is required to qualify for a 100% rate pension of &euro;233.30, and banded payments apply for those with lower yearly averages.  For example, where someone entered insurable employment aged 16 and had 2,000 weekly contributions (38.5 years) paid and/or credited, they would have a yearly average of 40, and would receive a pension at 98% of the full rate (for those in the 40-47 band).  People who qualify for lower band rates may, if they satisfy the means-test, qualify for the State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the State pension (contributory).  Where their spouse is in receipt of a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult, which may be paid at up to 90% of the rate of a full pension (by default, this payment is made directly to the Qualified Adult).</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years after that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. </p>  <p>  When the home-makers scheme was introduced, it had no retrospective effect, i.e., it only applied to such periods following the introduction of the scheme.  Had it been introduced for other periods, aside from administrative challenges in verifying such periods which pre-date computerised records, it would have carried a very significant cost, which would have been met by existing contributors through increases in contribution rates, by existing pensioners by reduced payment rates, and/or by the Exchequer, funded by higher taxes or lower spending elsewhere.  This cost would be significantly greater now because the numbers of pensioners is much greater and the pension payment rate has increased.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund. For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  The position of women who were home-makers is being given specific and careful consideration in developing detailed proposals.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The loans under the scheme range from &euro;100 to a maximum of &euro;2,000, and have a maximum interest rate of 12% per annum.  Over 1,200 loans have been drawn down under the Scheme to date with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down is &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments are then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union.   The Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the rollout and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme.  Following an evaluation of the pilot, the Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is working towards this aim.  Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the loan scheme through efforts to recruit Credit Unions to participate in the scheme.  To help advance this aim, I have written to all Credit Union Chairpersons and Managers, to encourage participation in the scheme.  Ultimately, participation in the scheme is a matter for each individual Credit Union to consider.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The provisions of the Act are being commenced on a step by step basis dependent on factors including software development (which is well underway) and training of registrars. This work is being progressed as quickly as possible.  Section 13 of the Act provides for a record of deaths of Irish citizens who die while abroad (referred to in the Act as the &lsquo;record of deaths abroad&rsquo;).  Section 13 has not yet been commenced.  This delay is due to industrial action by staff in the Civil Registration Service. </p>  <p>  Staffing and resolution of industrial relations issues in the Civil Registration Service are a matter for the HSE.  However, I am concerned about the matter and my officials, while not directly involved in the dispute, have made the HSE aware of these concerns.  I understand that discussions are ongoing and that good progress has been made.  At this point I am not in a position to say when the provisions may be commenced. </p>  <p>  It is important to note, that, whereas industrial action by employees of the Civil Registration Service of the Health Service Executive, while being a factor in the delay to the commencement of Section 13, this does not in any way prevent the relatives of a person who dies outside the State obtaining a Death Certificate in the country where that death occurred.  When a person dies outside the State a Death Certificate is issued by the authorities in that jurisdiction.  This certificate is the official Death Certificate. </p>  <p>  On commencement of section 13 of the Amendment Act, the recording of a death on the &lsquo;record of deaths abroad&rsquo; will be non-mandatory.  A certificate of entry on the record of deaths abroad does not purport to replace the Death Certificate.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010, and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF.  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no general retirement age in the State, and in the private sector the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement to claim Jobseekers benefit before receiving a State pension, nor is there any proposal to introduce such a requirement.  However, if someone who was required to leave employment has yet to reach the State pension age of 66, he or she may make such a claim, if they satisfy the conditions of the scheme.</p>  <p>  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are required to leave employment.  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (which effectively means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year).</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance apply to jobseekers under 26 years of age.  This measure aims at protecting young people from welfare dependency by providing young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If a young jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment rose rapidly in the recession to over 30% in 2012.  According to the Quarterly National Household Survey for Quarter 2 2016, youth unemployment fell by 3.4% to 19% compared to Quarter 2 2015.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that all young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs, through earlier and enhanced engagement processes.</p>  <p>  Reserved places on a number of programmes and youth-oriented variants of existing schemes have also been rolled out. Overall, young people took up just over 19,000 Youth Guarantee-related programme places in 2015.  These numbers exclude an estimated 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  Other EU and OECD countries adopt a similar targeted approach in terms of young jobseekers receiving a reduced social welfare payment.  Unless every effort is made to encourage and support our young people to engage in education and training there is a risk that they may drift into welfare dependency.</p></reply>

A 75% Bonus was paid in December 2015 to some 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients such as pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and the long-term unemployed at a cost of &euro;197 million.  It is estimated that the cost of a 75% bonus would be approximately &euro;200 million in December 2016, while a 100% bonus would cost &euro;267 million.  Extending eligibility for the bonus to jobseekers with an unemployment duration of 12 months, instead of 15 months, would further increase this cost.</p>  <p>   I will shortly be seeking approval from my Government colleagues for the payment of a Bonus this year.

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.976 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million. These savings meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;228 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 420,000 customers.</p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew, arising from the increased number of pension recipients. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.</p>  <p>  The Department of the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has responsibility for the Seniors Alert Scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The grant assistance is made available through community and voluntary groups registered with that Department and the equipment supplied under the scheme remains the property of the community group.</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This has increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate, the impact of the last Budget has been very positive for older people.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

On 23 March 2006, the Government approved the extension of the &lsquo;Centenarian Bounty&rsquo; scheme whereby persons born on the island of Ireland, who have reached 100 years of age, wherever they may now reside, became eligible for the award of a &euro;2,540.  It should be noted that, while the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade processes applications received from outside the State, the decision to award the Centenarian Bounty is the responsibility of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  Once the Department processes an application, a recommendation is made to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in on awarding the Centenarian Bounty.</p><p>From 1<sup>st</sup>January 2011 to 30<sup>th</sup>September 2016 the Department made recommendations to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in for 1,005 bounty recipients resident outside of the State - 14% were men and 86% were women. </p><p>Information on the Centenarian Bounty is available online, particularly through the Department&rsquo;s website and also on the websites of the President and of the Citizens Information Bureau.  The Department also advertises the Centenarian Bounty through its public outreach work and mission network.

The Statement of Strategy will articulate how this Department intends to implement the commitments assigned to it under the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, this Department must have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and treatment of our staff and customers, and protect the human rights of staff and customers.  An initial assessment of the human rights and equality issues arising from the Department&rsquo;s role as a policy maker, service provider and employer has begun in tandem with the drafting of the Goals, Outcomes and Outputs which make up the Statement of Strategy.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also offered its assistance to our Department to identify the best possible approach to this public duty and officials from my Department intend to draw on their expertise.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has a consistent record in relation to the promotion of human rights and equality globally.  My Department chairs the Inter-Departmental Committee on Human Rights and actively engages with civil society domestically and abroad.  Human rights and equality issues are mainstreamed into the development of all our external policies.  In addition, the Department is also conscious of the need to reflect the obligations of the Act into our internal policies and procedures as they are developed.  In recent years, the Department has taken a number of steps in relation to gender equality.  These include the establishment of a Management Board Sub-Committee on Gender and Diversity, as well as the development of a Gender Equality Action Plan.  Two working groups &ndash; one on gender equality and one on diversity and equality &ndash; have been set up to take work forward in this area. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment relating to equality and gender proofing in the Departmental and Budgetary process.  I understand that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is replying today to a similar Question from you on what his Department is doing centrally to seek to ensure that budgetary processes are equality and gender proofed.  I fully support such efforts and am committed to ensuring that the staff of my Department are equipped with the skills necessary to enable them to fulfill this commitment.  The Department will continue to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to this end. </p></reply>

The Government is continuing to use every possible opportunity to underline our concerns about this case to the Egyptian Government, and also with the EU.  </p>  <p>  I met with Foreign Minister Shoukry last week in New York where I highlighted my concerns at the repeated delays in the court proceedings and reinforced the Government&rsquo;s support for the recent Decree 140 application made by this citizen&rsquo;s lawyers.  Both I and An Taoiseach have communicated our support for this application in writing to Minister Shoukry and President el-Sisi respectively.</p>  <p>  As has been previously reported to the House, An Taoiseach has been in direct contact on a number of occasions with President el-Sisi of Egypt about this case, underlining the Government&rsquo;s concerns about the continuing detention of this young man, who has been in prison for over three years now without having been convicted of any crime, and who is part of a group trial that has been adjourned on fourteen occasions.  </p>  <p>  At the last hearing (29 June), the trial was adjourned until early October following an application by defendants for an expert review of the audio-visual evidence in this case.  It was originally anticipated that a technical hearing connected to the audio-visual evidence review would take place on 2 October.  However the hearing did not proceed as the 2nd of October was designated in recent days as the opening day of the Hijra (Islamic New Year) Feast, and a public holiday.</p>  <p>  The Court Office has indicted that the next hearing date is likely to be 12 November and we are awaiting confirmation of this date through official channels.  On Sunday last, 2 October, I spoke directly to Egypt&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland, Soha Gendi expressing my concern about further delays and underlined the Government's strong desire to see this citizen returned to Ireland as a matter of urgency.  My officials are continuing to work closely with this citizen&rsquo;s family and with his lawyers in Dublin and Cairo.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I stand ready to further engage with the Egyptian Government as and when appropriate, in line with our key focus of securing this citizen&rsquo;s best interests; this means continuing our determined efforts to see him released by the Egyptian authorities at the earliest possible opportunity and, in the meantime, providing consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. </p>  <p>  All of the sustained and focused actions that have been taken by my Department throughout this case have been aimed at furthering these two objectives, and importantly, avoiding any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.</p>  <p>  Significant resources in Cairo and in Dublin continue to be deployed in the provision of consular assistance in this case and my officials are in close contact with both the citizen&rsquo;s family and their legal representatives.  </p>  <p>  To date, the Egyptian authorities have been cooperative in allowing regular access by Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Egypt to this citizen for the purpose of conducting consular visits.  While the Ambassador travelled to the prison last week, on that occasion the citizen declined the opportunity of a visit.  We are aware of the reports of this citizen&rsquo;s medical condition and any such concerns on his behalf have been promptly raised by the Embassy with the relevant authorities, most recently on Thursday, 29 September.  The occasion of prison visits provide an important opportunity for the Embassy to discuss with the citizen any issues relating to his health and well-being and to raise any concerns directly with the prison authorities.  I therefore regret that this citizen declined the visit last week.   </p></reply>

They are first and foremost official facilities for use by the Embassies and State Agencies, working together in the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s political and economic interests.  These official spaces are used extensively to promote our exports and tourism, to attract inward investment, to promote our culture and heritage, to reach out to our diaspora communities, and to build relationships with key contacts and influencers in the countries where we have diplomatic representation.</p>  <p>  This is very much the case in Tokyo, where nearly half of the rented space is actually for representational purposes.  The State Agencies, in partnership with the Embassy, use this space to showcase Ireland as a centre of excellence in areas such as research and development, fin-tech, ICT, agri-food, tourism and culture. So far in 2016, the Embassy has hosted 32 events and welcomed some 1,214 guests there. </p>  <p>  The criteria for selecting official diplomatic accommodation is that it should be centrally located in safe and secure areas, it should have appropriate floor space for representational functions, as well as living quarters for the Head of Mission and his/her family, that the rent should be in line with local market rates and that it should be available for extensive use by the embassy and the State agencies for official events. </p>  <p>  Once a location has been identified, it is reviewed by the relevant HQ unit in Dublin against these criteria, with cost, location and suitability being the key factors in deciding whether or not to grant approval to proceed with the lease.</p>  <p>  Rental prices are based on floor space.  The space in Tokyo consists of 720.45 square metres, 302.22 sq. metres of which are used for representational space and the remainder for private accommodation. </p>  <p>  The lease contract for this property was agreed and signed on 28 November 2001.  The lease commenced on 17 July 2002, and will expire on 31 March 2017.  The original lease contract contained an automatic upward rent structure, but that was discontinued in November 2009 following negotiation with the landlord.  The last rent review was completed in September 2015.  During the most recent negotiation, the core rent was reduced from JPY 5,670,000 to JPY 5,103,000 &ndash; a saving of JPY 567,000.</p>  <p>  The current rent for the residency works out at &euro;62 per sq. metre.  The owner of the residence is now renting the same type of accommodation to new tenants at &euro;79 per sq. metre.  The rent paid by the Embassy is therefore significantly below the current market price.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to review all options in relation to official accommodation in all countries where we have diplomatic representation so as to ensure value for money.  Where possible, we also examine the scope for purchase with a view converting rental payments into a long term assets for Ireland.  </p></reply>

Of these, 900 are estimated to be unaccompanied minors.  On a visit to Calais on 26th September, President Hollande announced the definitive closure of the Camp and the redistribution of its inhabitants to centres throughout France.  The President described the planned closure as a &ldquo;full and final&rdquo; dismantlement which will be completed by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  The French Government is to provide for 9,000 places in the centres throughout the country. Migrants will be offered the chance to apply for asylum in France, and those who do not qualify will be sent home.  For unaccompanied minors, there will be specific accommodation arrangements. </p>  <p>  President Hollande said that the objectives of these actions are to &ldquo;guarantee the security of the people of Calais, to maintain public order and to ensure for the migrants and refugees that conditions are dignified&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that persons who are currently in another EU Member State - including those in the camps in Calais - and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so. </p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  With regard to unaccompanied minors Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year. </p>  <p>  Matters relating to Asylum and Refugees in Calais are a matter for France in the first instance, acting in conformity with applicable EU agreements and processes, and I have confidence in the French authorities to manage this issue.</p>  <p>  Of course I share the concerns expressed by Deputies in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group.</p></reply>

Under this legislation, a new Statement of Strategy must be submitted to a Minister within six months of their appointment.  Therefore, the process to develop a new Statement of Strategy is well underway in my Department.  This work will, of course, be informed by the priorities set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government (PfPG) and the overall economic, budgetary and fiscal context.  In addition, my Department is aware of the statutory Duty referred to in the Deputy's question and is currently examining how this legal requirement might be reflected in its new Statement of Strategy.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Deputy's question, the PfPG contains a commitment to developing a process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.   </p>  <p>  There are currently a number of established procedures in place already supporting the delivery of this PfPG commitment, including the requirement that all Memorandums for Decision submitted to Government set out the estimated impacts of the proposal across a range of areas including gender, social inclusion and people with disabilities.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, at Budget time the current practice, carried out by the Departments of Finance and Social Protection, involves the ex-post impact assessment of the main tax and social welfare measures introduced in the Budget.  These exercises use the ESRI micro-simulation (SWITCH) model to assess the impact of these policy measures across different household types based on a large-scale nationally representative survey.   </p>  <p>  A new initiative currently underway in response to the commitment in the PfPG commitment in relation to equality budgeting is the undertaking of Social Impact Assessments of public expenditure policies to help examine the targeting of public spending.  In this regard, in order to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of budget expenditure measures on household living standards, my Department is developing a new Social Impact Assessment Framework designed to focus on policy areas that cannot easily be incorporated into the existing SWITCH model, specifically the impacts of public expenditure on recipient households.  Depending on the available data, the impacts of expenditure in certain policy areas may also be examined with regard to certain group characteristics e.g. age, gender, regional spread.  In the future, the aim will be to expand the assessment, in so far as is possible within the available data constraints, to encapsulate the impact of a particular policy measure on other identified groups. </p>  <p>  The framework aims to complement the existing process that takes place each year with additional information on where Government resources are spent and who the key beneficiaries are.  The Social Impact Assessment Framework will play an important part in delivering the PfPG commitment to develop a process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights. </p></reply>

Following a review of Section 40, which involved, inter alia, consideration of submissions from interested parties, I announced proposals in December 2015 to introduce legislation to allow for managed hedge cutting and burning at certain times within the existing closed period on a pilot two year basis.  The legislation required to allow for these pilot measures was included in the Heritage Bill 2016, which was published in January 2016 and subsequently completed Second Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. </p>  <p>  Steps are in hand to reintroduce the Heritage Bill into Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the earliest opportunity.

An Post is a commercial State body that generates its income from its business operations, including through the provision of various services for Government Departments and agencies.  The company does not currently receive financial support from the Exchequer outside of the funding it receives for the provision of those services. </p><p>The postal sector has been undergoing systemic change both nationally and internationally in recent years, with the increased use of electronic communications leading to the decline in core mail volumes year on year.  In recognition of this changing business environment, the Post Office Network Business Development Group, chaired by Mr Bobby Kerr, was established in late 2014 to examine the potential for new and existing Government services to be transacted through the post office network and to identify new business opportunities for the network. </p><p>The final report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group, which was published in January of this year, made a number of recommendations to support the future sustainability of post offices.  These include recommendations in relation to the renewal of the post office network, the development of a basic payment account, the provision of motor tax services, and the creation of hubs around which local economic and social activity could revolve.  The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.  A number of Working Groups have been established to progress the recommendations, including through the establishment of a Network Renewal Implementation Group, which is being independently chaired by Mr Kerr.  This Group is examining the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees. </p><p>I have separately established the Post Office Hub Working Group to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  My officials are also examining the potential for the post offices to deliver services such as motor tax payments and a basic payment account.</p><p>The Government is, therefore, taking a range of measures to support the post office network to adapt to the changed business environment in which it operates.  The network will, however, continue to operate within the context of An Post&rsquo;s commercial mandate.</p></reply>

In addition, one of the means to help improve health outcomes in this area is through the expansion of the National First Response Network. Community first responder groups comprise this national network.  These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.  They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.</p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups.  CFR Ireland works with the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.  There are currently 137 Community First Responder groups linked to the National Ambulance Service National Emergency Operations Centre.  If an emergency 999/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.  The First Responder then goes straight to the scene and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service Emergency resources arrive.</p></reply>

The review was undertaken by Dr Niall Herity, a highly respected, Belfast based NHS cardiologist.  It is a comprehensive report which reflects the fact that Dr Herity consulted widely and met with all of the key stakeholders including the management and staff of both UHW and Cork University Hospital.</p>  <p>  Dr Herity has made clear recommendations that a second cardiac cath lab at UHW is not justified and I accept this.  However, he also recommends investing in UHW to enhance the existing cardiology services including increasing the number of weekly sessions currently provided, in order to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients.  He also recommends that new specialist equipment be provided to improve contingency for radiological equipment failure during a procedure.  I am happy to provide the additional resources necessary to implement these recommendations.  This investment will be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan for 2017.</p>  <p>  Dr Herity also recommends that some services be provided elsewhere.  However, in order to do this a number of operational processes will have to first be embedded.  I want to be certain that any change to how a service is delivered will result in improved services for the patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of ceasing primary PCI services at UHW by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access to a 24/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017.</p>  <p>  The Report on the Establishment of Hospital Groups notes that UHW should continue to provide invasive cardiology services for the population of the South East in collaboration with the cardiology service in Cork.  The patient flow analysis detailed in Dr Herity's report provides evidence that the Cath Lab in UHW is currently providing services to the population of the South East and, in particular, to residents of counties Wexford, Waterford and South Tipperary. Implementation of Dr Herity's report will provide improved cardiology services for the South East and will strengthen links between clinicians in UHW and Cork University Hospital.</p>  <p>  I intend to visit UHW next month and I will take the opportunity to speak with staff and management on a broad range of issues.</p></reply>

Approximately 10,000 children will benefit from this initiative".  In early June, I met with representatives of Our Children's Health.  At that meeting, and in the debate on the Private Members Motion on the 19 July 2016, I reaffirmed the Government's commitment in its Programme to providing medical cards to all children that qualify for the DCA. </p>  <p>  I also confirmed that this commitment was a priority for me in the upcoming budget discussions.  Detailed financial analysis is currently being conducted in order to establish as accurately as possible the expected costs to the Exchequer in each case. </p>  <p>  Subject to the required resources being secured in the upcoming budget negotiations, primary legislation will be required to give effect to this measure and it is my objective to have this prepared and brought to the Oireachtas as quickly as possible after the Budget. </p>  <p>  This new legislation will effectively mean that all 33,000 recipients of DCA will automatically qualify for a medical card.  Therefore, those children will no longer be subject to the medical cards means test at any point in the future while in receipt of DCA.  In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  Therefore, the requirements for administering the scheme and how the cards will issue will be a matter for the HSE.</p></reply>

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.</p><p>Key elements of the initiative include:</p><p>- the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million;</p><p>- the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs and Primary Care Teams to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million;</p><p>- measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.</p><p>The roll out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing.  To date 133 people living with dementia have benefitted under the funding allocated from the National Dementia Implementation Programme at an average cost of &euro;1,000 per package per week.  There are currently 72 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE will continue to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.</p><p>It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. </p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016 provides for a target of <b>10.4 million</b>Home Help Hours to support about 47,800 people.  It also provides for <b>15,450 </b>Home Care Packages<b></b>and<b>130 </b>Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs.  A further <b>60</b>clients with dementia will be supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.  </p><p>Home support services across the country are being stretched by demands from more people, and for more hours at times outside of core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, all of which cost more.  Activity in the first quarter of 2016 was ahead of the same period last year as efforts continued to alleviate pressure on the acute hospital system. </p><p>The Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an extra &euro;40m for home care in 2016.  This will ensure that the home support services provided in 2015 are maintained and that the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months. &euro;10m of this money has been ring fenced for home care as part of the new winter initiative.  The targets for 2016 will be reviewed in light of these additional resources.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to increasing provision for home care in the years ahead.  While the proposal from the Alzheimer Society will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Estimates exercise for 2017, at this stage I cannot predict what the outcome of that consideration will be.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  </p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.</p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living;</p><p>- Laundry service.</p><p>The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:</p><p>- Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;</p><p>- An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;</p><p>- If an applicant has a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p><p>- If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p><p>- Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;</p><p>- A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.</p><p>In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  This is known as the  Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support), the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.</p><p>A person&rsquo;s financial assessment can be reviewed, at their request, if 12 months have passed since the initial financial assessment or the most recent review, or if the HSE is satisfied that there has been a material change to the person&rsquo;s financial circumstances.</p></reply>

However, the Government is aware of the continuing needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments which support choice and independence.  In that regard, monthly payments of up to &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance. </p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Department of Health.  In that regard, I can confirm that work is at an advanced stage on policy proposals for the drafting of primary legislation for this new scheme.

There will be two changes made to the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule later this year with the introduction of Men B and Rotavirus for all babies born on or after 1 October, 2016.  The HSE is currently working on the necessary preparations for the introduction of these new vaccines.  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  The Men B immunisation programme which is scheduled to start in quarter 4 this year makes Ireland the second country in Europe to make the vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme. </p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has recommended that the Men B vaccine is given at 2 and 4 months with a booster at 12 months of age.  However, NIAC has made no recommendation in relation to a catch up programme for older children.  The introduction of this vaccine to the childhood immunisation programmes means that all children born on or after 1 October, 2016 will automatically receive the vaccine.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However, the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme. </p></reply>

Approximately 10,000 children will benefit from this initiative".  In early June, I met with representatives of Our Children's Health.  At that meeting, and in the debate on the Private Members Motion on the 19 July 2016, I reaffirmed the Government's commitment in its Programme to providing medical cards to all children that qualify for the DCA. </p>  <p>  I also confirmed that this commitment was a priority for me in the upcoming budget discussions.  Detailed financial analysis is currently being conducted in order to establish as accurately as possible the expected costs to the Exchequer in each case. </p>  <p>  Subject to the required resources being secured in the upcoming budget negotiations, primary legislation will be required to give effect to this measure and it is my objective to have this prepared and brought to the Oireachtas as quickly as possible after the Budget. </p>  <p>  This new legislation will effectively mean that all 33,000 recipients of DCA will automatically qualify for a medical card.  Therefore, those children will no longer be subject to the medical cards means test at any point in the future while in receipt of DCA.  In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  Therefore, the requirements for administering the scheme and how the cards will issue will be a matter for the HSE.</p></reply>

This direct communication with the patient or their carer allows the pharmacist to evaluate the patient&rsquo;s overall health and health needs, perform a therapeutic review of the prescription, and for the required patient counselling to take place.  It also allows the pharmacist to verify the authenticity of the prescription and to evaluate the safety and appropriateness of supplying the medicine in the particular circumstances presented.</p>  <p>  In general, monthly prescriptions are dispensed by pharmacies on a monthly or 28-day basis depending on the type of medicine and the form in which it is packaged by the manufacturer.  A prescriber may, on occasion, request that patients are only supplied with one week's supply of medicine at a time, due to the nature of the medicines involved and/or any ongoing safety concerns for the patient. In such circumstances, the prescription would be required to be dispensed by the pharmacy on a weekly basis, and this would be governed by the particular patient's care needs.  This is known as phased dispensing.  The rules in relation to dispensing have not changed since 1996. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the HSE that its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) issued a letter to all pharmacies on the 5 May to reconfirm the rules applying to phased dispensing.</p></reply>

The HSE is focused on offering graduating nurses and midwives permanent posts and on replacing agency staff with permanent staff.</p>  <p>  Recruitment of additional nurses is the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals with campaigns in train in Ireland and abroad with a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 available to nurses who return from overseas.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives.</p>  <p>  Within the Mental Health Sector, where there are particular difficulties at present, a number of measures have been introduced to increase nurse staffing levels in the short and long term.  In the short term this Department issued a Circular to the HSE National Director of HR to allow a derogation from public pay policy for mental health nurse retirees to return to work for the HSE beyond the first point of the mental health nurse salary scale typically at the LSI point.  In addition to this it was agreed that from 1st September 50% of the Community Allowance will be restored and the remaining 50% will be paid from 1st January 2017 (and backdated to 1st September 2016) for nurses who take up positions in the community.  To address the long term staffing levels there has been an increase of 60 additional mental health student nurses for 2016 and an additional 70 places have been agreed for 2017.  Efforts will continue to address the recruitment and retention issues within the Mental Health Sector.</p>  <p>  All of the measures mentioned above will facilitate the recruitment and retention of nursing staff at all grades and disciplines within the Irish health service.  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE on matters concerning the recruitment of nurses and midwives and other key staff.</p>  <p>  The Organisation Of Working Time Act 1997 provides a level of protection to employees on health and safety grounds, states that  the maximum average working week should not exceed 48 hours and specifies public holiday entitlements.  The HSE terms and conditions of employment for staff in the health services who work public holidays meet and in some instances exceed those set out in the Act.  Historically the average working week of junior hospital doctors would have been significantly more than 48 hours.  Following intensive efforts by management over the past three years, in conjunction with the IMO, the working week of 80% of doctors is now in accordance with the Act and the related EU Directive.  This in the interests of the doctors and patients and the aim is to progress to 100% compliance.</p></reply>

In their 2016 National Service Plan, the HSE's priority is to provide 1.3 million hours of personal assistance to more than 2,000 people with a disability.  This is the same activity level that was funded in 2014 and 2015.  PA hours are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the service is at all times responsive to client's needs and that the hours available are allocated appropriately and in a timely manner.  The HSE has confirmed that in excess of &euro;30 million is spent annually on the provision of PA Services.</p>  <p>  The HSE funds a range of assisted living services, including personal assistant services, to support individuals to live full and independent lives.  The personal assistant works on a one-to-one basis with the person with a disability both in the home and in the community.  A vital element of this personalised support is the full involvement of the individual service user in planning and agreeing the type of support and the time that support is required.  Assisted living services are provided either directly by the HSE or in partnership with a range of voluntary service providers, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association.</p>  <p>  Any increases in demand for personal assistant services due to demographic pressures and changing needs must be met within the level of resources available.  As the Deputy will be aware, the level of funding available for the HSE is being considered as part of the national estimates / budgetary process for 2017, which is currently underway.  Following this process, the HSE will then prepare its National Service Plan for 2017.  Pending agreement of the National Service Plan, I am not in a position to comment on service levels, including personal assistant hours, to be provided in 2017.</p></reply>

However, the Government is aware of the continuing needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments which support choice and independence.

It is clear that the resources available for home supports need to be strengthened and we have committed in the Programme for Government to improving the situation.  As a first step, an additional &euro;40 million has been made available for the maintenance and development of home care services to the end of 2016, including &euro;10 million as part of the HSE's Winter Initiative Plan 2016/2017 for an extra 950 Home Care Packages.  These will be targeted at 10 specific hospitals over the winter plan period.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to improving the resourcing of home care services as a priority in the period ahead.  I am also considering how the service can be optimally structured to meet the needs of clients in as consistent and transparent a way as possible within the resources available at any given time.  In this context the Health Research Board has been asked to carry out an evidence review to examine the regulation and funding of home care services in comparable jurisdictions.  This should be completed by the end of the year and will inform future decisions about the structure and governance of home care services.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure, and every application must be assessed on that basis.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. </p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. </p>  <p>  The person in question should contact the HSE directly to discuss whether they may be eligible for a medical card. HSE local health offices provide assistance to anyone completing the medical card application form.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

In their 2016 National Service Plan, the HSE's priority is to provide 1.3 million hours of personal assistance to more than 2,000 people with a disability.  This is the same activity level that was funded in 2014 and 2015.  PA hours are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the service is at all times responsive to client's needs and that the hours available are allocated appropriately and in a timely manner.  The HSE has confirmed that in excess of &euro;30 million is spent annually on the provision of PA Services.</p>  <p>  The HSE funds a range of assisted living services, including personal assistant services, to support individuals to live full and independent lives.  The personal assistant works on a one-to-one basis with the person with a disability both in the home and in the community.  A vital element of this personalised support is the full involvement of the individual service user in planning and agreeing the type of support and the time that support is required.  Assisted living services are provided either directly by the HSE or in partnership with a range of voluntary service providers.</p>  <p>  Any increases in demand for personal assistant services due to demographic pressures and changing needs must be met within the level of resources available.  As the Deputy will be aware, the level of funding available for the HSE is being considered as part of the national estimates/budgetary process for 2017, which is currently underway.  Following this process, the HSE will then prepare its National Service Plan for 2017.  Pending agreement of the National Services plan, I am not in a position to comment on service levels, including personal assistant hours, to be provided in 2017.</p></reply>

The Directive establishes a framework for cross border healthcare between EU/EEA states to facilitate patients to access care in another Member State in accordance with their entitlements in their own country.  Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have the costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  As such, it allows Irish residents to avail of healthcare in other EU or EEA (excluding Switzerland) Member States that they would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation. </p>  <p>  Public patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of the country abroad under CBD.  Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways - i.e. patients must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long-term care, organ transplantation, etc.  All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

That Plan proposes 24 actions to drive the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector and sustainably grow production in the sector by 45,000 tonnes.</p>  <p>  Action number 22 of the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development commits my Department to a review and revision of the aquaculture licence process, including the applicable legal framework.  This Review is echoed by the recommendations of FoodWise 2025.</p>  <p>  Aquaculture licences are determined by my Department having regard to the requirements of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, the Foreshore Acts 1993-2011, the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, the Aarhus Convention, requirements relating to underwater archaeology and certain other regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  Thus, the process around aquaculture licensing is extremely complex and demanding.  Nevertheless, my Department made 104 aquaculture licence determinations in 2015, some 53 licence determinations have been made so far this year and in the order of 150 determinations are expected for the year as a whole.</p>  <p>  The National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development recognised the complexity of the present process and related legal framework.  It committed to a review of the licensing process, including the legal framework.  I am presently considering this commitment and the many other actions proposed in the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development and expect to progress the issue in 2016.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the proposed review of the aquaculture licensing process is to identify ways to achieve more timely determinations.  Suspending the licensing process would be entirely counter to that objective.  In addition, the legislative framework for aquaculture licensing does not provide for the suspension of the licence determination process.</p></reply>

This report dealt with dealing with governance, finance, regulation and welfare.  This action plan is published on the BnG website. </p><p>I am committed to implementing the Indecon recommendations and my Department has established processes to monitor BnG's progress in this regard. </p><p>I will shortly be bringing forward the heads of a Greyhound Amendment Bill to deal with issues relating to governance, regulation and enforcement.  In the meantime a number of significant steps have already been taken. </p><p>Appointments to the board have been made through the Public Appointments Service process, and individuals with skill sets specifically identified by Indecon have been appointed.  Bord na gCon is working to improve its financial position and reduce its borrowings over time through a combination of actions, including the disposal of assets, the calibration of race meetings at poorly performing stadia, the reconfiguration of its hospitality services and the development of new products.</p><p>With regard to regulation, I am advised by Bord na gCon that it has carried out an extensive review of procedures for regulatory control.  I understand that many new operating procedures have been finalised or are close to finalisation.  New secondary legislation is now in place requiring the publication of adverse analytical findings from greyhounds tested for prohibited substances after 1st October 2015.  Greyhounds testing positive for these substances will be banned from racing until a further negative test result is obtained.  The findings of cases initiated after that date which come before the Control Committee and the Control Appeals Committee will be published, as will the reasons for the decision.  In addition, a Scientific Committee on Doping and Medication Control was established to advise on these matters.  I understand its report was published in July of this year and is available on the BnG website. </p><p>The power to take samples at the licensed premises of industry participants is being augmented and an intelligence led testing regime is being developed and rolled out.  Furthermore, BnG is developing a collaborative strategy with other agencies, in so far as legislation permits, to ensure intelligence led mechanisms are in place with other agencies to make the best use of scarce resources in this area of risk for the industry.</p><p>BnG has commenced the process of strengthening the sanctions for animal cruelty and has launched its first prosecution under the legislation for failure to comply with a welfare notice.  An on-line resource centre has been launched for <i>inter alia</i>the future publication of welfare information and notices as appropriate.  A process has been commenced whereby BnG regulations will require that records are kept of all medication administered to greyhounds.  </p><p>On the question of financial targets, it is the case that the BNG operating environment is difficult.  Information relating to key performance indicators such as tote receipts, attendance figures, prize money etc, is contained in BnG's annual accounts which are published.  In addition, the Indecon Report made a number of recommendations intended to improve the financial situation of BNG and its implementation is being carefully monitored by my department. </p></reply>

These sources are the surrender to the Reserve of entitlements that remain unused for two consecutive years, the clawback derived following the sale of entitlements without land, or the application of a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements.  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding has been established.

The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 has modernised the legal framework relating to the welfare of animals.  Sections 11 and 12 of the Act 2013, which contain the main principles relating to the welfare of animals and cruelty to animals, provide that a person having an animal in his or her possession or control must safeguard and not threaten the health and welfare of the animal.  In addition, it is an offence for a person to cause unnecessary suffering, endanger, neglect or be reckless regarding the health or welfare of any animal. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure its effectiveness, the Act provides for increased levels of penalties for offences committed under the Act.  For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty has been increased from &euro;100,000 to &euro;250,000, with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment.  Section 58 of the Act also provides that a person convicted of an offence under the Act may be disqualified from keeping, owning or working with an animal.  These penalties are in keeping with Irish jurisprudence and therefore I do not envisage further changes.</p>  <p>  However, my Department will continue to assess court outcomes in cruelty cases and will take account of these in any future review of the Act.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the large investment in data recording and genomics which have been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  The BDGP has been agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (2014-2020) alongside a number of other schemes.  I am conscious of the positive effect that the programme will have on the Irish suckler herd.  It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the Irish suckler herd.  I firmly believe that the scheme will deliver long-term and cumulative positive effects for both suckler farmers participating in the scheme, and farmers who buy the progeny of suckler cows for further finishing.  It is a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of sustainable beef. </p>  <p>  In relation to any possible reopening of the scheme, this will have to be considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the Rural Development Programme and the potential impact both upon the scheme itself and other schemes.  However, it will not be possible to allocate additional resources to the scheme, having regard to the very large financial commitment already made to the BDGP in the Rural Development Programme, and the significant budgetary pressures across the agri food sector and it will have to be considered in the context of existing budgetary resources.</p></reply>

This group is defined as farmers who are under 40 years of age, established their holdings prior to 2008 and who hold low value entitlements.  An estimation of the cost of increasing the value of existing entitlements to the National Average for these 3,900 farmers stands at over &euro;12 million.</p>  <p>  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding of &euro;24 million had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by clawback derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources will be limited.  The Regulations also provide for the application of a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements to replenish the National Reserve. Decisions in relation to the National Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding has been established.  </p>  <p>  Under the National Reserve priority access must be given to the two mandatory categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;.  Support for other categories such as those that may be regarded as suffering from &lsquo;specific disadvantage&rsquo; can only be considered once the two mandatory categories have been catered for.  Decisions in relation to potential categories for inclusion under any National Reserve in 2017 can only be considered once the overall position on potential funding has been established.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to pursue  the category of Forgotten Farmers at EU level.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-04a.1516.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016100400078#WRX03600"><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>The procurement process aims to identify an entity or entities to build, rollout, operate and deliver high speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps upload and 6 Mbps download speeds to all premises within the intervention area.  </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.</p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Louth.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.  The business referred to by the Deputy in the Question is within the Intervention (AMBER) area.  This means that it is not within an area receiving services from commercial broadband providers but will be included in the State Intervention network rollout.</p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015.  This includes over 15,000 premises in Louth. On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services.  My Department is conducting further analysis to identify these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process.  This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map. </p><p>The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.  Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed draft proposals, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. </p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of qualified bidders and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys in July 2016. The Taskforce will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place. I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the taskforce report.</p></reply>

It is also possible for me, as Minister, to establish an advisory panel to provide an opinion to the BAI on the application of the relevant criteria to the media merger in question.  Following receipt of the BAI's report and recommendations, I must then make a decision either to allow the merger to proceed, to allow it to proceed with conditions or to refuse to grant my consent.</p><p>In accordance with the Guidelines on Media Mergers, my Department facilitates pre-notification meetings with the parties to a proposed media merger.  The purpose of such meetings is to answer questions the parties may have about the media mergers process and the notification form.  A pre-notification meeting was held with the legal representatives of INM and Celtic Media on 22 September 2016.</p><p>It would not be appropriate for me to provide further comment while this case is currently under consideration.</p></reply>

However, it is important to note that the electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive and that they operate within national and European regulatory regimes. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent statutory body.  The CER is focussed on actions to mitigate costs for business and residential consumers, such as rigorous scrutiny of network costs, deeper integration with European energy markets and the delivery of a truly competitive market in the interest of customers.  The CER continues to monitor the electricity and gas markets to ensure that competition continues to develop and that customers benefit from competition.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken in recent years to assist consumers deal with energy costs.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) procured Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Meters to help those in difficulty with energy bills to better manage their usage and reduce the risk of disconnection.  The network companies undertook the rollout of over 100,000 of these meters.  The rollout of PAYG meters has contributed to a fall in the number of disconnections and limited the accumulation of dangerous levels of arrears.  The Department continues to work with the CER and the energy industry to ensure that there are no impediments to their continued availability to customers who are at risk of energy poverty.</p>  <p>  The energy industry, specifically Bord G&aacute;is Energy, Electric Ireland, Energia, Flogas Natural Gas and SSE Airtricity adopted a voluntary code of practice, the 'Energy Engage Code', that saw them commit to never disconnect an engaging customer, to avoid disconnections in the winter period, and to work with their customers on realistic and achievable payment plans for any arrears.</p>  <p>  The Code supplements existing obligations on suppliers as set out in the CERs Electricity and Natural Gas Supplier Handbook. The impact of the Code on the level of disconnections is be continuously monitored by the CER.</p>  <p>  The Deputy gave details about a reconnection charge.  The levying of these charges is an operational matter for ESB Networks, which operates the distribution network on the electricity grid.  This is the medium and low voltage electricity network used to deliver electricity to connection points such as houses, offices, shops, business premises, and street lights.  Tariffs and charges levied by ESB Networks are also regulated by the CER.  In order to ensure that only equitable levels of costs are collected through these tariffs, the CER carries out annual reviews of ESB Networks&rsquo; costs incurred in developing, maintaining and operating the distribution system.</p>  <p>  Further information on the levying of charges on electricity customers and complaints in relation to connection the electricity network should be addressed to the CER who may be contacted at 01 4000800, 1890 404 404, energycustomers@cer.ie or Commission for Energy Regulation, The Exchange, Belgard Square North, Tallaght, Dublin 24.</p></reply>

The regulation of the electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and I have no function in the matter. </p><p>Any party that wishes to connect to the national grid must apply to the system operator (either the Transmission System Operator, EirGrid, or the Distribution System Operator, ESB Networks) and the system operator then issues a connection offer based on the policy set by the CER. This policy is captured under two broad processing approaches: the Group Processing Approach (GPA) and the non-Group Processing Approach (non-GPA).</p><p>The GPA has been designated for larger, renewable and conventional generators. Under the GPA, system operators issue connection offers to these generators in batches, called &quot;gates&quot;.  The last iteration was Gate 3.</p><p>The non-GPA is the process to connect small, renewable and low carbon generators that fulfil public interest criteria.  The CER has decided  (CER/09/099 &ndash; available on www.cer.ie) that the following list of technology or classes of technology exhibit public interest benefits and are, therefore, preapproved for processing outside of the GPA: Bioenergy, Combined Heat and Power,  Autoproducers, Hydro, Ocean, Wave, Solar, Geothermal and Experimental/Emerging Technology.</p><p>It is my understanding that electricity generators (including micro-generation) eligible to be processed outside of the GPA will receive a non-GPA connection offer provided that all technical requirements for connecting to the grid are fulfilled by the applicant.  The process for connecting a micro-generator is detailed on the ESB Networks website () </p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">While I cannot comment on an individual Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) application, I can confirm that it is normal practice that a REFIT applicant would liaise directly with officials in my Department to receive updates on the status of any application, and I have asked my officials to follow up with the REFIT applicant referred to by the Deputy.</font></p><p>The CER consultation document of December 2015 on a <i>Review of Connection and Grid Access Policy (CER/15/284)</i>addressed the question of access to the grid.  Responses to the consultation were published by the CER on 10 March 2016. </p><p>My Department is working on the development of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS).  Exploring the scope to provide support for renewable micro-generation technologies will  form part of the my Department's on-going analysis to underpin the scheme.  The introduction of any new scheme - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported &ndash; will ultimately be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.  Over the coming months there will be an additional public consultation phase on the design of the new scheme, the details of which will be advertised on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

There is a wider issue, however, of the risk of driver distraction caused by electronic communications devices in general and the proliferation of devices and apps has made this a growing problem.  I believe that there is a need to address this in a comprehensive way, and it involves two aspects.</p>  <p>  The first, and perhaps most important, is driver education.  People need to be aware of the serious risks posed by distraction, and to avoid risky behaviour which could cause distraction with potentially lethal consequences.  Making drivers aware of the risks is one of the matters which the Road Safety Authority, in its role of public information and education on road safety, is addressing on an ongoing basis.  The second question is how to address this in law.  The General Scheme of a Road Traffic Bill which was considered in pre-legislative scrutiny in 2015 contained proposals to deal with electronic devices.  The discussion at the time was very useful, not least because it exposed how difficult it is to frame appropriate legislation in this area which would both capture current problems and be, in as far as possible, future-proofed.  As a result of the discussions at that time, the Road Traffic Bill 2016 as initiated does not contain proposals in this area.  My Department has since discussed this matter with the RSA and the Garda&iacute;, but the priority has been work on the current Bill.  I look forward to addressing the issue of electronic devices in future legislation.</p></reply>

Its legislative mandate includes the provision, operation and management on a commercial basis of air navigation services in Irish controlled airspace, including terminal navigation services at Ireland's three State airports (Dublin, Cork and Shannon).  In addition to its commercial mandate, the IAA also has a regulatory mandate.  The IAA is responsible for the independent safety regulation of Irish civil aviation, including the safety regulation of Dublin Airport.  In that context, the IAA acts independently and objectively on a daily basis in relation to Dublin Airport.  In so far as the new regulatory regime for airport noise is concerned, the IAA is required to establish a separate unit for its airport noise regulation activities.  This will be functionally separated from its commercial activities in the provision of air navigation services.  There is a requirement for regulatory independence in the relevant EU Regulation No. 598-2014 and its achievement by functional separation is specifically permitted.</p></reply>

I am arranging to transmit directly to the Deputy further details of that announcement, which describe the main elements of the new regulatory regime for airport noise.  As set out in that announcement, a key element of the new regime is the designation of the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) as the competent authority with the necessary powers to implement EU Regulation 598/2014 in Ireland.  Only Dublin Airport currently and foreseeably exceeds the 50,000 aircraft movements' threshold in the EU Regulation.  In accordance with legislation currently in preparation in my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, the IAA will be required to undertake a review of the noise situation at Dublin Airport immediately following commencement of this legislation.  The IAA will be the only body empowered to make determinations on operating restrictions to apply at the airport.  The IAA will not be bound by operating restrictions foreseen in the planning permission granted in 2007 for the new runway at Dublin Airport.  The new regulatory regime for airport noise will be built on strong collaborative working arrangements between the IAA and other statutory bodies that have roles and expertise relating to noise management, in particular An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Fingal County Council and the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is also the case that there will be no change to the necessity for compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Habitats and Birds, and the Environmental Noise Directives.</p></reply>

For anyone interested in starting or growing a business, the LEOs may be able to offer soft supports in the form of training and mentoring. </p><p>In September 2015, a new guide was launched setting out the range of State supports available for the manufacturing sector, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and brings together all these services in a single publication to enable Irish businesses access the support they may not even realise they are eligible for. Details are at:<i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i><i></i></p><p>In the area of access to finance, a range of initiatives has been introduced - from Microfinance Ireland to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, and from the Credit Guarantee Scheme to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund - and continued investment in seed and venture capital through Enterprise Ireland.  These initiatives remain available and accessible to business and continue to provide increased access to credit and finance for Irish enterprise.</p></reply>

This group was focussed on coordinating the response from the State in terms of assisting affected staff.  The inter-agency group also helped to develop a demographic and skills profile of former staff at the BOSE facility.  This was completed by IDA Ireland in partnership with BOSE HR locally.  This profile is central to IDA Ireland&rsquo;s continued marketing of the location.  I understand that the other company referred to does not intend to re-locate to Monaghan at the expiration of the current lease of their facilities in County Louth.  However, the IDA will continue to bring the BOSE facility to the attention of other prospective investors.

CETA represents a modern high standard agreement which has the ability to set a new global standard for Trade Agreements.  It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open up markets for services and offer predictable conditions for investors.  CETA will save on duty costs as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.</p><p>Chapter nineteen in CETA on Government Procurement will eliminate the asymmetry between the EU and Canada, given that the EU procurement market is already de facto open to Canadians, including at the sub-federal level, while in Canada the access for EU firms is very limited.  This will not require any change in practice, and leaves the existing procedural framework as set out in the EU procurement Directives intact.</p><p>For the first time, Canadian provinces, territories and municipalities will open their procurement markets to a third country, going well beyond what Canada has offered in the GPA (the multilateral Government Procurement Agreement) or under NAFTA (the North America Free Trade Agreement).  Canada&rsquo;s provincial procurement market is estimated to be double the size of its federal equivalent. </p><p>In accordance with the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), sovereign governments have the right to organise public services and institutions as they see fit.  CETA preserves the right of the EU and its Member States to maintain existing or adopt, new or more restrictive, measures in the future for the areas or sectors specified in the Annex II reservations of the agreement.  These reservations include public monopolies and the exclusive rights of public utilities at all levels of government and public services such as health, education, water supply and public services.  </p><p>The full text of CETA, including the Annexes and reservations, is publically available on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website at -</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

Since the launch of the first Plan in 2012, 176,000 more people are in employment, driven by growth in job openings in both the manufacturing and services sectors.  Our target under the 2016 Action Plan for Jobs is to add 50,000 new jobs this year.  We have made a good start.  Over 36,000 new jobs were created in the six months of 2016.  According to the CSO the unemployment rate fell to 7.9% in September this year, down from 9.1% in September 2015.  The seasonally adjusted number of persons unemployed was 172,900 in September 2016, down from 180,200 when compared to the August 2016 figure and youth unemployment fell to 15.9% in September 2016 from 20.9% in Sept 2015.  The Government's Enterprise 2025 is a whole of enterprise strategy, aimed at delivering opportunities across all regions and across all sectors.  It sets the ambition to achieve full employment that is sustainable and resilient over the longer term.  A key part of delivering on this ambition is about establishing a vibrant and stimulating ecosystem for entrepreneurship in all sectors and in supporting small businesses to sustain and grow employment. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) of my Department provide advice guidance and financial assistance and other supports to all people regardless of ethnicity that wish to start their own enterprises.  A number of LEOs have undertaken targeted initiatives to engage with prospective entrepreneurs amongst the Traveller and Roma communities as well as other ethnic and minority groups.  The best practice in respect of any such specialised initiatives is ensured on a national basis through the LEO Centre of Excellence in Enterprise Ireland. </p>  <p>  The main responsibilities for measures to increase employment in the Traveller and Roma community rests with the Minister for Social Protection through the INTREO service as well as with the Minister for Justice and Equality who has overall responsibility for the compilation and implementation of the National Traveller and Roma inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) to which my Department also contributes.</p>  <p>  In this regard, Community Employment (CE) has special provision for members of the Travelling Community.  Travellers aged 18 or over who are unemployed and in receipt of jobseekers benefit, jobseekers allowance for 1 week or more, or Travellers who are in receipt of one parent family payment for 12 months or longer, are eligible to participate on CE.  Declaration of membership of the Travelling Community is up to the individual, and many Travellers are eligible under the other standard CE categories and so do not show under the Traveller eligibility category.  The statistics for those Travellers who declared membership of the Travelling Community for August 2016 shows 225 participants.</p>  <p>  There are a number of specialist Traveller CE schemes, including Clondalkin Travellers Enterprise, West Cork Traveller and Environmental Project, Northside Travellers Support, Southside Traveller Action Group, Travellers Support Group Blanchardstown, Navan Travellers Workshops, Galway Traveller Movement, and Pavee Point.</p></reply>

This is a whole of Government effort and is delivered through our integrated Action Plan for Jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs process aims to strengthen the enterprise base, in particular through supporting entrepreneurship, start-ups and small and medium sized enterprises. </p>  <p>  The terms &lsquo;entrepreneur&rsquo; and 'entrepreneurship' can encompass a wide array of activities and individuals.  The National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship identified entrepreneurship with establishing a new firm or venture.  Richard Cantillon, an Irish economist of French descent in the early 18th Century is credited with introducing the term 'entrepreneur' as what most people understand as meaning someone who organizes land, labour or capital to produce or supply goods and services and assumes the risk of a business in return for the profits.  This definition emphasises the role of the entrepreneur in taking on risk. </p>  <p>  In turn, entrepreneurs can be either &lsquo;replicating entrepreneurs&rsquo;, who establish and organise a business firm to mimic the function and processes of firms already in existence, or &lsquo;innovating entrepreneurs&rsquo;, who introduce a change or innovation, whether through the invention of a new good or service, introduction of a new method of production, creation of a new market, discovery of a new source of supply, or re-organization of an industry in such a manner as to improve efficiency. </p>  <p>  The definition of the entrepreneur as an individual establishing a new firm or enterprise captures the role of the entrepreneur in establishing a new business.  The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) collects cross-country data on individuals establishing new ventures.  The Central Statistics Office (CSO), as part of their Structural Business Statistics, collects data on the legal form of new enterprises, which determines whether a new enterprise is liable for income tax (as an individual proprietor) or to corporation tax (as an incorporated firm). </p>  <p>  Self-employment and SME owners are often used as proxies for entrepreneurship, and have the merit of inclusivity and capturing the risk-taking element of entrepreneurship.  These are also measurable through surveys carried out by the CSO.  In addition, income from self-employment is often subject to different deductions for tax purposes and provision is available for capital allowances in recognition that income from self-employment derives from a trade or profession, while social insurance systems treat self-employed persons differently in terms of contributions and benefits. </p>  <p>  The Department of Finance frame legislation in relation to all tax matters.  There are a range of tax expenditures provided to entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises through the tax system.  Specifically, for the purpose of availing of the revised CGT Entrepreneur Relief introduced in Budget 2016 and given effect in Finance Act 2015, and which offers a 20% rate of CGT (rather than the standard 33% rate) on qualifying assets disposed of by a qualifying individual, up to a lifetime limit of &euro;1 million in qualifying gains, the following conditions apply:</p>  <p>  -  A qualifying individual is someone who holds 5% or more of the shares in the company (or is a sole trader or owns the company outright) and has worked as a director or employee of the company for three out of the previous five years</p>  <p>  -  Qualifying assets are shares in or assets of any company other than those involved in certain excluded activities, including dealing in shares, securities, commodities, land or property.</p></reply>

Following a decision by the Council with the consent of the European Parliament, it will now be possible to provisionally apply CETA.  The EU Commission is currently finalising the text on provisional application of CETA for submission to the Council for a decision on the 18th October 2016.  As provisional application will cover only those areas for which the EU has full competence, no constitutional issues arise.  It is proposed that provisional application will not apply to investment protection and investment dispute settlement.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the full entering into force of CETA will be subject, in the first instance, to a decision by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and secondly by the approval of all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.  In this regard, D&aacute;il Eireann will be a part of the final decision to ratify CETA in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.</p></reply>

My Department will engage fully with this process. </p>  <p>  My Department has a clear commitment to equality in its dealings with staff and stakeholders and these commitments are accessible to the public and to staff through a number of policies and procedures. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Customer Action Plan 2014 - 2016, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, commits to ensuring that the rights to equal treatment established by equality legislation are met and that diversity is accommodated so as to contribute to equality for the groups covered by the equality legislation (under the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller Community). </p>  <p>  The Customer Action Plan also commits to identifying and working to eliminate barriers to access to services for people experiencing poverty and social exclusion, and for those facing geographic barriers to services and to providing clean, accessible public offices that ensure privacy, comply with occupational and safety standards and, as part of this, facilitate access for people with disabilities and others with specific needs.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, which forms part of every Civil Servant's Contract of Employment, commits all staff to conducting themselves impartially and having regard to equality of treatment towards all stakeholders and clients.</p>  <p>  The Department is an equal opportunities employer and has a range of policies in place for staff in respect of dignity at work, equality and on the Civil Service Code of Practice on the Employment of People with a Disability.</p>  <p>  There are also other 'central' government policies which my Department implements, such as the 40% target for gender equality on State Boards.</p></reply>

The Department is mindful that service providers need to manage cash flow and, therefore, the ECCE payment schedule was posted on the Programme Implementation Platform (PIP) on 1st September 2016.  Providers can now also check payments on PIP for themselves.</p>  <p>  The Department is conscious of the administration and eligibility changes for the childcare sector this year, and so is keen to minimise any further change from a provider's perspective as a result of this transfer of payments to Pobal; by retaining the status quo, with the exception that all payment queries will now be dealt with by Pobal vis their online support.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that the funding provided for the delivery of childcare programmes is understood by the Department to include the whole cost of delivering these programmes. </p>  <p>  The Department accepts that the sector is under cost pressure, and will make submissions as part of the estimates process aimed at securing increased capitation for the sector.  This could then be used to deliver CPD; to fund non-contact time, etc.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to conducting and publishing an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare.  This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of a new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme and is currently being progressed in that context.</p>  <p>  Department officials are reviewing previous published research and analysis on the cost of childcare provision, are assessing available data sources and are scoping the precise requirements for the independent review.  It is suggested that the review would have to consider (1) the total average cost of quality childcare provision, (2) variation in cost and the reasons for same, (3) the link between cost and quality, (4) the cost of providing childcare services in disadvantaged communities and (5) the likely impact of future cost pressures, including the ongoing professionalisation of the sector.  </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the Department will tender for independent expertise to conduct the review in the autumn with a view to ensuring that the review is commenced later this year.</p></reply>

The new Regulations replace the Pre-School Service Regulations 2006.</p>  <p>  The new Regulations contain a number of new requirements that must be satisfied by the providers of pre-school service, both private and community/not-for-profit, including a minimum qualification requirement for staff working directly with children.  The Regulations also require that new pre-school services must register with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, prior to opening.</p>  <p>  Some of the new requirements have associated documentary elements.  For example, service providers must now have a complaints procedure in place under which all complaints received by the service must be dealt with appropriately and in a timely manner in accordance with the service&rsquo;s complaints policy.  A record of the complaint, including the nature of the complaint and the manner in which the complaint was dealt with, must be retained by the service.</p>  <p>  A pre-school service provider is also now required to review the quality and safety of the care provided to the children in the service, including a review of the service&rsquo;s policies and procedures, on an annual basis, and retain a record of the review.</p>  <p>  While I accept that some of the new requirements contained in the Regulations will place some administrative burden on service providers (both private and community), I believe that all of the measures detailed in the Regulations are necessary to protect the health and safety and promote the development of the children attending the service.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Tusla is currently working on a Quality and Regulatory Framework that will set out in some detail what will be expected of a service provider in the course of inspection.  This Framework will be the subject of significant consultation with the sector before it is implemented, and training and information sessions will also be provided nationally to ensure that all service providers are familiar with the requirements and what will be expected of them. </p></reply>

Information is not available in relation to the numbers of public sector pensioners re-employed in the public sector prior to 1 November 2012.  Prior 1 November 2012, holders of public sector pensions who were subsequently re-employed in the public sector were not required to inform their previous or new employer of any employment, public sector or otherwise, obtained by them subsequent to leaving the public sector.  Such obligations were introduced by the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012. </p><p>The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 provides that any person who takes up employment in a public service body on or after 1 November 2012 and</p><p>-  has an existing entitlement to retirement (including preserved) benefits under any public service pension scheme,</p><p>-  has received, or is in receipt of, retirement benefits under any public service pension scheme, or</p><p>-  applies for a benefit from a public service pension scheme,</p><p>is obliged to declare such matters to the public service employer with whom they are taking up further employment.  This applies regardless of whether the pension holder is being re-employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or other basis.  </p><p>In tandem with that measure, section 52 of the 2012 Act provides that where a retired public servant who is in receipt of a public service pension resumes employment in the public service on or after 1 November 2012 their pension is liable to abatement, that is, cessation or reduction as appropriate.  Abatement basically means that the combined amount of his/her earnings from their current public service job plus their existing public service pension, cannot exceed the up-rated (current) pensionable pay from their old job.  Essentially this means that from 1 November 2012, a public servant retiring on pension who at some later point re-enters any public service employment must make a declaration and will be subject to abatement and may, depending on his/her overall earnings, have their public service pension reduced or suspended for as long as they are in that new job.</p><p>Prior to 1 November 2012, this abatement principle operated as a standard feature of public service pension schemes generally, but only within individual sectors/bodies where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former occupation, e.g. Defence Forces, Garda, Civil Service etc.  The 2012 Act extends the abatement principle across and between all sectors without exception.  The extended pension abatement measure applies only where a public service pensioner takes up another public service post/position on or after 1 November 2012.A public service pensioner already in public service employment<b></b>immediately before that date will not be affected by the change while he or she remains in that post/position.  The change does not apply in relation to employment with the commercial semi-State bodies. </p><p>Since the enactment of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012, eleven individuals who are in receipt of a public sector pension have been employed as civilian employees attached to military installations and my Department has engaged two retired public servants as civilian drivers to the Minister of State, Mr. Paul Kehoe T.D.
