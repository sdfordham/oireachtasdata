There are currently approximately 828,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;77 million.  In 2012, along with the then Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport, I established an interdepartmental working group to review the free travel scheme.  The purpose of the review was to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme.  Owing to the range of policy changes implemented since its establishment, the scheme is now universally available to all persons permanently living in the State aged 66 and over as well as carers in receipt of carers allowance and certain others such as persons in receipt of disability allowance and invalidity pension.  I understand that the interdepartmental group has concluded its work and I expect to see a copy of its review shortly.  </p>  <p>  With respect to the cap on funding imposed by the previous Government under the National Recovery Plan, 2011-2014, while no additional funding for free travel was provided for in Budget 2015, the Government has taken no specific decision to extend the freeze and in the &ldquo;Statement of Government Priorities, 2014-2016&rdquo; the Government committed itself to the full retention of the free travel scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-24a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400068#WRA00800"><p>I welcome the considerable debate generated by this reform, which is long overdue.  As I said earlier, despite committing extensive funding to lone parent payments since the 1970s, lone parents remain the most at-risk-of-poverty, and their children are at a high risk of poverty.  For too long, significant numbers of lone parents have been typecast, and confined to social welfare dependency.  The best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment.  The purpose of the reform of the one parent family payment is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment.  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports, such as back to education allowance, back to work enterprise allowance and community employment.  In addition, I was pleased to introduce the back to work family dividend in the last Budget.  This provides a significant incentive for families with children to move into employment, as recently reported by the ESRI. </p>  <p>  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. </p>  <p>  Any reversal of these reforms would delay this critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future. </p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to reverse the forthcoming changes to the one parent family payment. </p>  <p>  However, I look forward to examining the various supports available to all families with children, including single parent families, in the next Budget.  In particular, I will look at the scope for improvements in the child benefit, as well as other supports for families in part-time or full-time employment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-24a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400068#WRA01000"><p>There are approximately 360,000 self-employed contributors including business owners, contractors, taxi drivers and farmers.  These self-employed pay PRSI at the class S rate of 4%.  This entitles them to access long-term benefits including State pension (contributory).  A combined employer and employee PRSI rate of 14.75% is paid in respect of most employees, who can access the full range of social insurance benefits.  The most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund published in 2012 found that a 15% contribution rate would be needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), to the self-employed.  This compares very favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  In its 2013 report the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare found that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Therefore, it was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p>  <p>  However, the Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  In this regard the Group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points, payable on a compulsory basis only.  </p>  <p>  I am anxious to see the level of entitlement for the self-employed improve but any such change will need to be funded through an appropriate level of contribution.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-24a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400068#WRA01200"><p>The official measure of poverty as used in the national social target for poverty reduction is consistent poverty - the combination of at-risk-of-poverty and basic deprivation.  The rate of consistent poverty in 2013 was 8.2%, which was not a statistically significant change on 2012.  The 2014 results are expected at the end of 2015.  One of the component measures of consistent poverty is at-risk-of-poverty. This fell from 16.5% in 2012 to 15.2% in 2013.  A key reason for this fall is the enhanced impact of social transfers in reducing income poverty.  In 2013, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 45.5% to 17.9%; thereby lifting over a quarter of the population of children out of income poverty.  This is equivalent to a poverty reduction effect of 61%. Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers. </p>  <p>  Tackling poverty among children and families is a Government priority.  The Government is implementing a whole-of-government, multi-dimensional approach to tackling the issue of child poverty.</p>  <p>  A key way to tackle child poverty, and lone parent poverty, is to get parents back to work.  The ongoing one parent family payment reforms and the new back to work family dividend - which I introduced in Budget 2015 - will support parents to take up and remain in employment, especially those furthest from the labour market. </p>  <p>  In addition, as I said earlier, I look forward to examining the various supports available to all families with children, including single parent families, in the next Budget.  In particular, I will look at the scope for further improvements in the child benefit, as well as other supports for families in part-time or full-time employment.</p></reply>

At the end of May 2015, the Department had made year to date payments of &euro;8.25 million to almost 3,600 employers in respect of 4,900 employees.  Two levels of payment are provided - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years &ndash; provided the employment is maintained.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed.  Since 2015, the scheme has been expanded to include those transitioning into employment from the one-parent family payment scheme, and short-term unemployed young people via the Youth Guarantee.  A review of the pilot phase of JobsPlus, covering the first year of its operation (from July 2013 to June 2014), confirmed that the aim of putting in place an easily identifiable and user-friendly scheme targeted at employers had been achieved.  It also found that over 60% of jobseekers, more than 24 months on the live register, have benefitted from the initiative, contrary to expectations prior to the introduction of the initiative.  The review noted that the average level of subsidy paid at the end of June 2014 amounted to just under &euro;374 per employee per month and that there was a net benefit to the Exchequer from each employee maintained in employment.   </p>  <p>  In line with commitments made in the context of Pathways to Work, the Department recently looked at the first 18 months of operations of JobsPlus.  This confirmed that the findings from the earlier review remain valid.  I propose to publish the outcome of the reviews in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-24a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400068#WRA01600"><p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in supporting 68,000 families and individuals at a cost of &euro;298 million.  Over 5,600 claims have been awarded in 2015, of which almost 1,600 are in Dublin.  The Department&rsquo;s recent review of rent limits points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting and seeking to rent is the reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  In this regard, the Government will deliver significantly increased supply of social and affordable housing through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.  My colleague Minister Alan Kelly announced recently the first major direct build social housing programme with the kick-starting of over 100 separate housing projects.  The move is part of the first phase of direct-build under the Government&rsquo;s social housing strategy. &euro;312 million has been approved by the Minister which will see an additional 1,700 social housing units come on stream by 2017 with an estimated 3,000 additional jobs in construction created. </p>  <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, has also advised his intention to bring proposals on rent certainty to Government before the summer recess.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has implemented preventative measures to provide for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits.  The Department also works with Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Sustainment service in Dublin and Cork city where supply is most acute.  This flexible approach has already assisted over 2,100 rent supplement households nationwide, of which 1,400 are in Dublin, through increased rent payments. </p>  <p>  Where Department staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss the preventative measures are implemented as appropriate.  The Department has also undertaken a communications campaign to encourage people at risk to avail of these measures to prevent an unnecessary episode of homelessness.  I am continuing to keep this matter under review. </p></reply>

The scheme was introduced on a pilot basis in 1986 and extended nationwide in 1988.  The scheme was seen as a form of enticement to those who lacked an incentive to take up employment.  Participants in this scheme are expected to continue to make efforts to find full-time work.  There are currently 381 participants on the scheme with a budget of just under &euro;2 million for 2015.  To qualify for the part-time job incentive scheme a person must be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for at least 390 days.  In addition, to qualify a person must have been in receipt of a higher jobseeker's payment than the appropriate part-time job incentive supplement payable, which is &euro;119 per week for a single person and &euro;193.90 per week where an individual was getting an increase for a qualified adult.  The scheme is not designed for young jobseekers but for the long-term unemployed.  Policy for under twenty five year olds is addressed by the Youth Guarantee which sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people 18-25 receive an offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship<i></i>within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.</p></reply>

Indeed, many defined benefit pension schemes have encountered funding difficulties in recent years and are working with the Pensions Authority to respond to those difficulties in a manner which will secure the sustainability of pension provision for scheme members.  A number of legislative changes have been put in place in recent years to assist employers and the trustees of pension scheme respond to the funding difficulties encountered by some schemes.  You will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to comment on matters arising in a particular scheme as these are primarily a matter for the Trustees of the scheme, the companies participating in the scheme, the scheme members and the Pensions Authority.  The sale of the Aer Lingus shareholding was approved by Government on 27 May.  The proceeds from any sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus would be payable directly to the Central Fund and the use of such funds is a budgetary decision for the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

The Ombudsman provides a valuable and essential service in ensuring that all citizens have an independent and accessible channel to raise complaints about State services.</p>  <p>  The number of complaints received in respect of the Department of Social Protection (DSP), increased to 898 in 2014 from 491 in 2013.  However seen in the context of the scale of DSP business, which in 2014 included 84.8 million scheme payments made, more than 1.1 million control reviews carried out and some 8.1 million telephone calls answered, the overall statistics are a very positive indication of service.  Many of the complaints received about the Department are dealt with expeditiously, sometimes over the phone. </p>  <p>  The annual report shows that of the DSP cases completed in 2014, 106 were upheld, but 255 were not upheld.  In addition, a substantial number were discontinued as premature.  </p>  <p>As the Ombudsman has stated, given the nature and scale of the DSP services the number of complaints is not disproportionate. </p>  <p>  The report also specifically references five DSP case studies.  These concerned an overpayment, a bereavement grant, two habitual residence condition (HRC) decisions and a rent supplement case.  Four of these cases were resolved through a revised decision of the Social Welfare Appeals Office where additional information was available and in the other case a revised decision issued by DSP. </p>  <p>  As the circumstances of each case is different, it is not always possible to draw general conclusions which are applicable in other cases.  However, in the bereavement grant case drew attention to an error, and following this case the Department put new structures in place to avoid a recurrence.</p>  <p>  In relation to the overpayment case, it is important to point out that where substantial debts are owed to the State, there is an obligation on the Department to make best efforts to collect them.  However in this case the Chief Appeals Officer ruled that the repayment should not be sought in the light of the medical circumstances and evidence submitted.</p></reply>

However, despite considerable investment, the scheme has not succeeded in preventing lone parents from being significantly more at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole.  In 2004, at the height of the economic boom, lone parents were more than four and a half times at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole.  Before the reforms to the scheme, lone parents could have been on the scheme until their youngest child turned 18, or 22 if they were in full-time education. </p>  <p>  This is why I believe that the reforms I have introduced are much needed as they are moving us away from providing passive income support over a long period towards an active, engagement approach. </p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports.  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. </p>  <p>  Any reversal of these reforms would delay this critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future. </p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to reverse the forthcoming changes to the one parent family payment. </p></reply>

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2015 Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;89 million on the farm assist scheme in 2015.  All recipients of farm assist benefitted from the Christmas Bonus in December, 2014.  All recipients with children are benefitting from the increase in child benefit announced in Budget 2015.  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 have brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons.  However, farm families with the lowest income will be least affected by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist have been maintained.</p>  <p>  The assessment of means for the farm assist scheme is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  Account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  Any farmer experiencing lower levels of income can ask for a review of their means.  </p>  <p>  As part of the normal budget process, all potential budget measures, including proposals relating to the farm assist scheme, are assessed in terms of the impact they would have.  The scheme is kept under ongoing review by my officials, including regular discussions with the IFA.  There are no plans to change the current scheme criteria.</p></reply>

The right to marry is a basic right and marriage, as an institution, has particular protection under the Constitution.  The State&rsquo;s duty is to protect the institution of marriage in legislation.  EU citizens and their families have the right to move and reside freely within the territories of the Member States.  These rights also apply to non-EU national spouses of EU nationals following the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Metock case in 2008.  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 includes provisions aimed at making it more difficult to broker a marriage of convenience in the State.  The Act defines &lsquo;marriage of convenience&rsquo; as 'a marriage where at least one of the parties to the marriage&mdash; (a) at the time of entry into the marriage is a foreign national, and (b) enters into the marriage solely for the purpose of securing an immigration advantage for at least one of the parties to the marriage'.</p>  <p>  The legislation which was enacted in December 2014 has not yet been commenced.  The provisions of the Act will be put into operation by an implementation plan involving both procedural and system changes.  It is intended that these will be finalised as soon as possible.  Discussions with the Department of Justice and Equality with regard to the cross-Departmental co-operation required to ensure that this issue is addressed effectively have been taking place, as part of the implementation plan.</p>  <p>  Entitlement to certain social assistance payments and child benefit is conditional on a residence requirement, independent of nationality, which ensures a genuine connection between the applicant for or recipient of such schemes and the State.</p>  <p>  The Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) was first introduced in Ireland in 2004 and amended in subsequent years, most recently in 2014.  The HRC is provided for in Irish legislation, in accordance with EU legislation and with European Court of Justice jurisprudence. </p>  <p>  Deciding Officers and Designated Persons, when determining whether a person is habitually resident in the State for social welfare purposes, will take into consideration all of the person&rsquo;s circumstances including the person's length and continuity of residence in Ireland or in any other particular country, length and purpose of any absence from Ireland, nature and pattern of employment, main centre of interest and future intentions as they appear from all the circumstances.</p>  <p>  The emphasis in the Department&rsquo;s Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy is on preventing fraud and error from entering the system in the first place.  In the context of persons coming into the country and falsely claiming benefit, the Department is continuing to develop and enhance cross-border and transnational structures and liaison to ensure that there is effective co-operation to prevent and detect social security fraud across national boundaries.  The Department also has an ongoing relationship with the Irish National Immigration Service (INIS) and Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  Two Departmental inspectors are assigned to the GNIB on a full-time basis.  Case by case information exchanges and data-matching takes places between INIS/GNIB and DSP on a systematic basis.  </p>  <p>  A number of other measures should also be noted. The Social Welfare Act 2012 made provision for social welfare inspectors to undertake power of enquiry at airports where social welfare fraud is suspected.  In addition, from the beginning of December 2014, 20 Garda&iacute; have been seconded to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit.  These officers will ensure a greater presence on the ground and will increase the investigative capacity of the Department to prevent, detect and deter social welfare fraud. </p>  <p>  Where fraud is discovered it is important that there are appropriate sanctions in place.  In this context, it is the Department's policy to consider for prosecution cases of fraud against the social welfare system.</p></reply>

One of these circumstances is where the person has what is defined as &lsquo;subsidiary employment&rsquo;.  The provisions for subsidiary employment are set out in social welfare regulations.  Subsidiary employments are employments that are considered secondary, for insurance purposes, to the principal employment.  To be considered as subsidiary employment under social welfare regulations the relevant employment should be in addition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s usual employment.  It must have been followed by them outside the ordinary working hours of their usual employment.  The limit of eligible earnings or profit from the occupation cannot exceed &euro;12.70 per day, or, where the level of eligible earnings or profit is in respect of a longer period, it does not on a daily average exceed &euro;12.70 per day.  The Department does not keep statistics on the number of jobseekers with subsidiary employment.  It is therefore not possible to gauge the cost implications for the State of increasing the current limit of eligible earnings for those engaging in subsidiary employment from &euro;12.70 to &euro;25.</p></reply>

However, despite considerable investment, the scheme has not succeeded in preventing lone parents from being significantly more at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole.</p>  <p>  In 2004, at the height of the economic boom, lone parents were more than four and a half times at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole.  Before the reforms to the scheme, lone parents could have been on the scheme until their youngest child turned 18, or 22 if they were in full-time education. </p>  <p>  This is why I believe that the reforms I have introduced are much needed as they are moving us away from providing passive income support over a long period towards an active, engagement approach. </p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports.  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. </p>  <p>  Any reversal of these reforms would delay this critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future. </p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to reverse the forthcoming changes to the one parent family payment.</p></reply>

My Department in conjunction with the D/CYA, introduced the after-school child care scheme and the community employment childcare programme in 2013 and 2014 respectively.  Both of these schemes were funded by my Department from savings from the child benefit scheme and build on the 25,000 subsidised childcare places provided by the D/CYA each year.  In Budget 2015, I introduced increases to the child benefit rate, the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus, as well as the back to work family dividend (BTWFD), all of which provide additional financial assistance to parents.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Spring Economic Statement acknowledged that a successful childcare policy helps people to transition from welfare to employment.

Since publication, a range of measures have been taken to deliver on the report&rsquo;s recommendations and work in this regard continues.  For example, in line with the recommendation that the implementation of the Consumer Protection Code should be monitored, the Central Bank has undertaken a number of themed reviews aimed at ensuring this is the case.  This includes a review of new requirements for annual pension statements introduced in 2012 which requires that information on charges be provided in a way that seeks to inform the customer.  The review found that the vast majority of firms were in compliance with the code.  Where the Bank identified a small number of firms where the format of annual statements was not as required, those concerned were required to submit implementation timelines for full compliance.</p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department is involved in complementary EU negotiations on a review of the IORPs (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision) Directive which lays down basic requirements for occupational pensions.  It is anticipated that final provisions will result in improved consistency of information to scheme members in pension benefit statements including transparency of charges.</p>  <p>  In terms of support to trustees of occupational pension schemes, the Pension&rsquo;s Authority is in the process of enhancing its e-learning website for trustee training which will include material on pension charges.  It is also updating the Trustee Handbook and expects to publish the new handbook, which will contain a chapter on pension charges, in the near future. </p>  <p>  Finally, the role of the new Pensions Council is to provide advice on pensions and to give a much stronger prominence to consumer concerns.  I have previously highlighted that there a number of specific matters which I want the Council to focus on and this includes the area of pension charges which, following its recent establishment, the Council has now begun to consider.</p></reply>

The analysis shows that almost 80% of jobseekers would see their income increase by at least 40% on taking up employment and six out of ten would double their income. In addition they find that, of the small number of people who would be better off on welfare than in work, close to five out of six still chose to work.</p>  <p>  The back to work family dividend (BTWFD), which I introduced in Budget 2015, improves the work incentives of unemployed jobseekers with children.  The scheme allows unemployed jobseekers with children, as well as one-parent family payment recipients, to keep the increases for qualified children they were receiving on their payment for up to a year when they take up employment. They can keep half of that amount for their second year in employment. This means that during the first year of employment a former jobseeker or one-parent family payment recipient can receive &euro;1,550 per child. </p>  <p>  The ESRI report finds that in the first year of the BTWFD the proportion of families with children facing a replacement rate of over 70% fell from 39% to 32%.  They also find that the BTWFD results in the proportion of jobseekers that would be financially better off not working decreases from 1 in 15 to 1 in 20.  </p>  <p>  As the BTWFD is paid on top of an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to the family income supplement it is very effective in further improving the work incentives for people with children.</p>  <p>  It is therefore clear that work pays with more than 100,000 additional people now at work and unemployment has fallen by over a third since the peak of the crisis.</p></reply>

In this context the department considers that its forms should reflect the choices being made by new customers on what payment channel they opt for.  The fact is that more and more of the department&rsquo;s customers are opting for payment of their social welfare entitlement directly into their bank accounts.  However, in order to ensure that the department&rsquo;s forms present payment options equally I have asked the department to update them to ensure that a neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided and to also to ensure that one payment option is not favoured over another.</p>  <p>  This Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as is clear in the Programme for Government.  It is a key piece of the social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  It is this Government&rsquo;s policy that An Post will remain a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service that will maintain a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.</p>  <p>   The Post Office Network Business Development Group, chaired by Bobby Kerr, has decided that the future of the Post Office will be best secured through the development of a more sustainable business model including the development of financial services, which is identified by the Group as fundamental to the future of the post office network.  The development by An Post of a payment account will be critical to a more sustainable business model as society inexorably moves to electronic payments rather than cash payments.  The post office network cannot remain reliant an income stream from my department for cash payment to its clients where an increasing number of social welfare recipients wish to receive payments to their bank accounts.</p></reply>

Rent supplement is a demand-led scheme and the Government will continue to ensure that the necessary resources for the scheme are in place.</p>  <p>  In response to the current difficulties experienced in the private rented market, the Department has implemented preventative measures to provide for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; individual accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.

It should also be noted that in July 2013 and in July 2014 almost 600 lone parents become new FIS recipients. These 600 individuals would have gained financially from claiming FIS for the first time. </p>  <p>  Almost 6,000 lone parents transitioned to jobseeker&rsquo;s scheme including the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment. The majority of customers who moved to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment received no change in their weekly income. However, individuals who were earning above &euro;60 per week incurred a loss as the jobseeker&rsquo;s means test is less generous than the equivalent OFP means test. </p>  <p>  Lone parents who have transitioned to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment are being supported by the Department to produce a personal development plan with the help of a case officer on a one to one basis. My Department will continue work with lone parents to provide them with enhanced access to the Department's supports and services. </p>  <p>  There were over 400 lone parents would have been due to transition from OFP and half rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to full rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. As a result these individuals would have suffered a drop in their weekly income. However, earlier this year I introduced an extension to the entitlement of the OFP so that from May of this year these customers can re-apply for OFP and provided they satisfy the conditions they will be able to retain OFP and half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance until their youngest child is 16 years of age.</p>  <p>  The remaining lone parents transitioned from OFP to a wide range of other payments or to education, training or employment programmes. </p></reply>

The liability to maintain family provisions, contained in social welfare legislation, are separate to family law legislation.</p>  <p>  In every case where a one parent family payment (OFP) is awarded, the Department seeks to trace the other parent (liable relative) in order to ascertain whether he/she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of the OFP.  A liable relative is given the option to commence making payments to the OFP recipient or directly to the Department.</p>  <p>  The issuing of a maintenance contribution assessment under the social welfare legislation does not alter an individual&rsquo;s obligation to discharge maintenance payments, pursuant to an order of the Court. </p>  <p>  In 2014, the Department issued 2,586 determination orders for maintenance.  As a result of the impending transfer of claimants from OFP to jobseekers transitional payments (JST), 134 of those determination orders issued to liable relatives in 2014 will no longer have a liability to the scheme from June 2015.  This represents approximately 5% of the determination orders issued in 2014.</p>  <p>  As indicated at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection on 18th February, where this matter was also raised, the Department is aware of this issue and will be considering an amendment to the JST arrangements in the future to pursue these liable relatives. </p></reply>

These individuals were invited to attend information sessions in their local Intreo offices where they were advised of the different options available to them when they transition from the OFP scheme. At these information sessions staff of the Department informed lone parents that the most financially advantageous option available to them was to work a minimum of 19 hours per week and claim family income supplement (FIS).</p>  <p>  On foot of these information sessions, estimates suggests that to date over 1,250 of these lone parents have become first time FIS recipients. This means these individuals have either taken up employment or have increased their existing hours of employment to claim FIS.</p>  <p>  The 1,250 lone parents who are new FIS recipients are now financially better off than when they were claiming the one-parent family payment.  These customers will also qualify for the new back to work family dividend (BTWFD) from 2 July.  The Dividend is worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year and reducing to 50% entitlement worth &euro;775 per child in the second year.</p>  <p>  In both 2013 and 2014 an increase in new FIS recipients from the lone parents who transitioned off the OFP scheme also occurred. This indicates that many transitioning lone parents have increased their hours of employment in order to become new FIS customers.</p>  <p>  Based on the experience to date there is no evidence of a trend in lone parents leaving employment on foot of the transition from the OFP scheme.  </p></reply>

The report culminated in recommendations which involve measures to introduce clarity and consistency across the various pension products, increase consumer understanding and provide a better result for the consumer.</p>  <p>  Since publication, a range of measures have been taken to deliver on the report&rsquo;s recommendations and work is ongoing in this regard.  For example, in line with the recommendation that the implementation of the Consumer Protection Code should be monitored, the Central Bank has undertaken a number of themed reviews aimed at ensuring this is the case.  This includes a review of new requirements for annual pension statements introduced in 2012 which requires that information on charges be provided in a way that seeks to inform the customer.  The review found that the vast majority of firms were in compliance with the code.  Where the Bank identified a small number of firms where the format of annual statements was not as required, those concerned were required to submit implementation timelines for full compliance. </p>  <p>  In terms of support to trustees of occupational pension schemes, the Pension&rsquo;s Authority is in the process of enhancing its e-learning website for trustee training which will include material on pension charges.  It is also updating the Trustee Handbook and expects to publish the new handbook, which will contain a chapter on pension charges, in the near future. </p>  <p>  The pension charges report refers to the broader pensions policy debate on the introduction of a universal pension system.  It indicates the introduction of such a scheme may be the most effective way to introduce change in this area.  International experience has shown that this type of scheme is extremely successful in providing a simplified and lower cost charging structure and a consistent application across employers.  This type of arrangement could assist in resolving the difficulties inherent in the current structure of a proliferation of small schemes paying considerably higher charges than larger schemes, ultimately eroding the value of the pension received by the member.  In this regard and in line with the Statement of Government Priorities, the Government recently decided to proceed with work to develop a roadmap for the introduction of a new, universal, supplementary workplace retirement saving scheme.  The Universal Retirement Savings Group (URSG) has been established to consider the constituent factors involved in constructing an efficient and effective universal retirement savings system and to bring forward a recommendation in the form of a roadmap and estimated timeline for introduction.   </p>  <p>  Finally, the role of the new Pensions Council is to provide advice on pensions and to give a much stronger prominence to consumer concerns.  I have previously highlighted that there a number of specific matters which I want the Council to focus on and this includes the area of pension charges which, following its recent establishment, the Council has now begun to consider. </p></reply>

Application for pension payments under this scheme would give an indication of the number of double insolvencies arising in the period since the ECJ ruling in the UK Robins case of 25th January 2007 and prior to the 2013 legislation.  Eleven schemes have been certified by the Pensions Authority as eligible schemes to apply to the Minister for Finance to pay pensions under PIPS.  Any of these schemes which considers that the State has a liability for a shortfall in the funding in the scheme will need to establish the extent of any liability arising.  No formal claim has been made in respect of any of these schemes.</p></reply>

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be accessed by anyone.  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  </p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network. </p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers.  </p>  <p>  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  </p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office. This option will remain on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. I also want to emphasise that the department continuously reviews its forms to ensure that they are amenable and relevant to all customers. In order to ensure that the department&rsquo;s forms present payment options equally, I have asked the department to update them to ensure that a neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided and to also ensure that one payment option is not favoured over another.</p>  <p>  The Department is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.  The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.  </p></reply>

These changes mean that all groups representing the interests of the various categories of pension schemes membership are treated the same in the context of the provisions in the Pensions Act.  These changes will facilitate engagement between groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members and the Pension Authority and the trustees of a pension scheme. </p>  <p>  In general, pension schemes in Ireland are set up under trust and, in that context the trustees of a pension scheme are required to act in the best interest of all scheme members. </p>  <p>  The issue of engagement with the industrial relations machinery of the State falls within the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is acknowledged that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature both as regards access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations.</p></reply>

However, customers who were already in receipt of Pre-Retirement Allowance on that date continue to receive payment as long as they satisfied the conditions for payment.  </p>  <p>  There are currently 5.3 people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  The over 65 year old population is projected to increase from 11% of the total population in 2010 to 15% in 2020, and to 24% in 2060. </p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund projects that without action to tackle a shortfall, the deficit will increase significantly over the medium to long term to &euro;3bn for 2019 and &euro; 25.7bn for 2066.  It is in this context, and mindful of the importance of maintaining the adequacy of the rate of the State pension, that a number of reforms have been introduced, in order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life. </p>  <p>  State pension age is being increased in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66 by the abolition of the State pension (transition).  The pension age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  It is anticipated that this rate of increase in pension age will be no faster than the rate of increased longevity.  It is also anticipated that the duration of a typical State pension may continue to increase, albeit more slowly than if these increases in pension age were not provided for.</p>  <p>  Where individuals are out of employment prior to pension age they often seek the support of either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. </p>  <p>  People in receipt of a jobseeker's payment must engage with the Department's activation measures and can face sanctions if they fail to do so.  However, since January 2014, these criteria have been eased for people aged 62 and over.  They are able to avail voluntarily of an array of supports from the Department if they wish to return to work, training or education but sanctions are not applied to this cohort, should they decide they do not wish to engage with the activation process.</p>  <p>  Special arrangements were also made so that this cohort of jobseekers register with their local office once a year and their payments can be paid directly into their bank accounts. </p>  <p>  In light of these reforms there are no plans to reintroduce the Pre-Retirement Allowance scheme for new entrants.</p></reply>

I welcome the considerable debate that has been generated by this reform, which commenced in 2012.  My priority is to ensure that we, as a society, arrive at a situation where lone parents have the same opportunities to access employment, training and education.  Despite committing extensive funding to lone parent payments since the 1970s, lone parents remain the most at-risk-of-poverty, and their children are at a high risk of poverty.</p>  <p>  The final phase of the one-parent family payment age reforms are due to take place on 2 July 2015 when approximately 29,400 one-parent family payment recipients will be transitioning out of the one-parent family payment scheme.  Approximately 19,800 are expected to transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, 4,100 to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and 5,500 to a re-rated family income supplement.</p>  <p>  The 5,500 customers already on family income supplement will have their payment automatically increased to take account of the loss of 60% of their one-parent family payment income and have received letters to that effect.  These individuals will also qualify for the back to work family dividend (BTWFD), which allows them to retain their increase for a qualified child when they transition off the one parent family payment.  The Dividend is worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year and reducing to 50% entitlement worth &euro;775 per child in the second year.</p>  <p>  All remaining customers were invited to attend information sessions in their local Intreo offices where they were advised of the different options available to them when they transition from the one-parent family payment scheme.  At these information sessions, staff of the Department informed lone parents that the most financially advantageous option available to them was to work a minimum of 19 hours per week and claim family income supplement. </p>  <p>  On foot of these information sessions, estimates suggest that to date over 1,250 of these lone parents have become first time family income supplement recipients.  These individuals are now financially better off than when they were claiming the one-parent family payment.  These customers will also qualify for the BTWFD from 2 July 2015.  </p>  <p>  The majority of customers who will move to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment will have no change in their weekly income.  However, individuals who are earning above &euro;60 per week may incur a loss as the jobseeker&rsquo;s means test is less generous than the equivalent one-parent family payment means test. </p>  <p>  Lone parents who transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment will be supported by the Department to produce a personal development plan with the help of a case officer on a one to one basis.  My Department will continue work with lone parents to provide them with enhanced access to the Department's supports and services.</p>  <p>  I look forward to examining the various supports available to all families with children, including single parent families, in the next Budget.  In particular, I will look at the scope for improvements in the child benefit, as well as other supports for families in part-time or full-time employment.</p></reply>

The majority of these customers were women given that currently 98% of one-parent family payment recipients are women.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to give definitive figures on the number of customers, who experienced a change in income on foot of transitioning from the one-parent family payment scheme as this depends on individual circumstances and the status of all affected customers may have changed in the interim.</p>  <p>  Over 2,000 customers transferred from the one-parent family payment and family income supplement to a re-rated family income supplement, which was automatically increased to take account of the loss of 60% of their one-parent family payment income.  It should also be noted that in July 2013 and in July 2014 almost 600 lone parents become new family income supplement recipients.  These 600 individuals would have gained financially from claiming family income supplement for the first time. </p>  <p>  Almost 6,000 lone parents transitioned to jobseeker&rsquo;s scheme including the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  The majority of customers who moved to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment received no change in their weekly income.  However, individuals who were earning above &euro;60 per week incurred a loss as the jobseeker&rsquo;s means test is less generous than the equivalent one-parent family payment means test. </p>  <p>  Lone parents who have transitioned to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment are being supported by the Department to produce a personal development plan with the help of a case officer on a one to one basis.  My Department will continue work with lone parents to provide them with enhanced access to the Department's supports and services. </p>  <p>  There were over 400 lone parents who would have been due to transition from one-parent family payment and half rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to full rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  As a result these individuals would have suffered a drop in their weekly income.  However, earlier this year I introduced an extension to the entitlement of the one-parent family payment so that from May of this year these customers can re-apply for one-parent family payment and provided they satisfy the conditions they will be able to retain one-parent family payment and half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance until their youngest child is 16 years of age.</p>  <p>  The remaining lone parents transitioned from one-parent family payment to a wide range of other payments or to education, training or employment programmes.</p></reply>

Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process. </p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology continue to be implemented.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  One of the biggest factors that delay claim process and results in reviews and appeals is the quality of the information provided by the customer.  The Department continues to take every opportunity to inform customers as to the requirements of the application processes by review application forms, use of tits web site and proactively meeting support group and organisation to ensure the message is available. </p><p>In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  <b>Table A &ndash; most commonly refused applications</b></p><p>2014 Appeal Receipts<table><tr><th>Disability Allowance</th><th><div>5,554</div></th></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance -

However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by unemployed jobseekers and, in accordance with the EU Council recommendation for a Youth Guarantee by young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee plan. </p>  <p>  As, under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee, the main plank in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation.  </p>  <p>  In this regard our first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  Accordingly operating processes are being refined in each of our regions to prioritise the early engagement of young people through Intreo to ensure that all young people receive expert advice and have access to progression options.  In addition as part of our commitment to engage with 100,000 long-term unemployed people through the Intreo/JobPath process during 2015 we are prioritising engagement with the c 25,000 young people who are already long term unemployed.  In implementing these processes DSP is applying learning from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee Pilot Project and making extensive use of the services of Local Employment Services and Job Clubs.</p>  <p>  For those who do not find employment through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 23,300 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2014.</p>  <p>  In addition we have recently introduced new programmes specifically for young people including JobsPlus youth &ndash; an employment subsidy for unemployed people under 25 years of age which is payable after four months of unemployment, and First Steps &ndash; a work experience programme for very disadvantaged young people.  There are a number of additional planned measures still to be implemented (International Work and Experience Training, County Enterprise Board Youth Entrepreneurship and Mentoring Supports).  It should be noted that some of the initiatives planned under the Guarantee required primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports. </p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 20.2% in May 2015 estimated by CSO, as compared to 25.0% in May 2014 and with a peak of over 31% in 2012).</p></reply>

It should be noted that some of the initiatives planned under the Guarantee required primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  </p>  <p>  Given the recent introduction of changes systemised data is not readily available on employment outcomes on all programmes specifically for those jobseekers under 25.  However, some indicative figures are available.  For example, </p>  <p>  - a follow-up survey, published by SOLAS in 2013 of F&Aacute;S Trainees who exited training in May/June 2012, found that 36% of full-time trainees under 25 had gained employment.</p>  <p>  - An Indecon report surveyed JobBridge interns who had finished their internships by end August 2012.  The survey indicated that 39% of young participants progressed into employment immediately on completion of the internship and that the proportion in employment rose to about 60% five months after completion.  Analysis of administrative data on those under 25 who have completed a JobBridge internship more recently shows a similar progression rate to employment immediately on completion of the internship, at 37%. </p>  <p>  - JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  Currently there are 4,901 participants benefitting from JobsPlus, 664 (13.5%) of whom are under 25.  It is too early to know what might be the employment outcomes once the JobsPlus subsidy expires.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has initiated on an extensive impact evaluation programme which will assess, using counterfactual econometric methods, the impacts of programmes and processes on employment outcomes.  This will include the longer-term employment outcomes for young jobseekers under 25. </p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 20.2% (37,100 persons) in May 2015 estimated by CSO, as compared to 25.0% (50,000) persons in May 2014 and a peak of over 31% (70,600 persons) in 2012).</p></reply>

As part of this strategy, the Department is engaged in the delivery of integrated Intreo centres, which provide a full range of services, including the CWS, generally available in one location.</p>  <p>  Where the CWS has been restructured alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.  For example, where a customer is unable to travel to a clinic, alternative arrangements are available including improved phone services and if necessary arranging a visit to the client's home. </p>  <p>  People claiming supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement, which are usually reviewed once to twice yearly.  The availability of the CWS during normal office hours is therefore sufficient for general day to day requirements.   </p>  <p>  However, in response to emergency situations such as those caused by severe weather events, local staff are proactive in contacting households affected and in providing targeted supports to those in need as swiftly as possible.  Community Welfare Services operating in the areas affected have in the past extended their opening hours providing additional emergency service which may be supplemented by facilitating clients with individual appointments and making house calls. </p>  <p>  The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.</p></reply>

There are approximately 68,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015. </p>  <p>  The overall cost of rent supplement per tenancy has increased nominally by approximately 1.5% over the last six months.  This increase is explained for the most part by the operation of the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework and the Tenancy Sustainment Protocol operated in conjunction with Threshold in Dublin and Cork.  Under these measures, rent payments are being made in excess of the rent limits to over 2,100 rent supplement households to ensure they retain their rented accommodation in view of the current difficulties in securing suitable and affordable accommodation.</p>  <p>  The provision of housing is a key priority for Government which is being addressed through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  It would be expected that the cost of the rent supplement scheme would be reduced following the implementation of a comprehensive local authority house building programme as those customers with long term housing needs would have their housing needs addressed.  The savings accruing to rent supplement would depend on the location of the housing and family types accommodated.  </p>  <p>  The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  HAP is currently in operation in nine local authority areas in which there are approximately 2,300 HAP tenancies already in place.  The financial provision for rent supplement for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the HAP.  There are plans to roll out HAP to 10 further local authorities during 2015.</p></reply>

In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.  In 2014 the average appeal processing time reduced to 28.6 weeks for an oral hearing and 21.1 weeks for a summary decision.  Processing times continue to improve in 2015 as the current average processing time for an oral hearing is now 25.6 weeks and 18 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>The reduction in processing times reflects the significant resources which have been invested in the Social Welfare Appeals Office over the last number of years.  </p><p>In addition the Department has undertaken a process of reform in many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing the time taken to respond to requests for submissions in relation to appeals.  Appeal processing times are kept under continual review in the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p><p>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant reduction in the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,957 at 22 June 2015.</p><p>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. </p>  <p>  Reduced rates for younger jobseeker's allowance recipients are a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency and ensuring that they are well placed to share in the economic recovery. </p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  That is why if a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker's allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  Any change to provision in this area would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  This strategy has been succeeding; in the year up to Q1 2015 the annual increase in employment was 41,300 (+2.2%).</p><p>The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 5.9% in Q1 2015.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 59.8% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012. </p><p>Despite these improvements, the level of long-term unemployment, and in particular the situation of those who are very long-term unemployed (more than two years), continue to be of concern.  The <i>Pathways to Work </i>Strategy therefore provides for enhanced engagement services and additional activation measures to jobseekers while the recovery takes hold.  In addition to ongoing reforms, the 2015 iteration of the strategy prioritises additional measures to enhance engagement with the long-term unemployed.  This includes a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact).  Second, a new employment services model for the long-term unemployed, JobPath, will be rolled out in 2015.  It is a payment by results contract model with third party providers of employment services that will provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers.  Referrals to JobPath providers are expected to commence early in the second half of 2015.</p><p>In support of these enhanced engagement processes, 57,000 FET places will continue to be reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015.  A minimum of 16,000 places for the long-term unemployed will also be provided through key public employment programmes.  This includes an expansion of the JobsPlus initiative, an employment subsidy that incentivises employers to recruit the long-term unemployed.</p></reply>

These self-employed pay PRSI at the class S rate of 4%.  This entitles them to access long-term benefits including State pension (contributory).  A combined employer and employee PRSI rate of 14.75% is paid in respect of most employees, who can access the full range of social insurance benefits. </p>  <p>  The most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund published in 2012 found that a 15% contribution rate would be needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), to the self-employed.  This compares very favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.</p>  <p>  In its 2013 report the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare found that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Therefore, it was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p>  <p>  However, the Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  In this regard the Group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points, payable on a compulsory basis only.  </p>  <p>  I am anxious to see the level of entitlement for the self-employed improve but any such change will need to be funded through an appropriate level of contribution.</p></reply>

This estimate includes the yield from increasing the tax rate in respect of corporate gains. The estimate assumes no behavioural impact on the part of taxpayers. Increases in rates may have a significant behavioural impact and as a result may not produce the expected increase in tax yield.</p><p>In respect of the revenue that would be raised for the Exchequer from abolishing Capital Gains Tax exemptions for private principal residences sold in excess of &euro;1 million, as information on the value of capital gains arising from the disposal of principal private residences is not required in Capital Gains Tax returns, there is no basis for separately identifying the yield that would arise from the removal of the exemption from CGT for sales of principal private residences above &euro;1 million. Accordingly, the specific information requested by the Deputy is not available.</p><p>Regarding the cost of allowing entrepreneurs/small and medium enterprises start-ups a three year Capital Gains Tax window for selling on their ideas and or businesses, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the CGT entrepreneurial relief that was introduced to encourage entrepreneurs to invest and reinvest in assets used in new productive trading activities. The measure applies where an individual, who has paid capital gains tax on the disposal of assets, makes investments in a new business in the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 and subsequently disposes of this investment no earlier than three years after the date of investment. Due to the conditions attaching to the relief no Exchequer cost arises in 2015.  Cost relating to this measure are not expected to arise until at least 2017 and on its introduction in Budget 2014 the full year cost was estimated at &euro;20 million.</p><p>Regarding the cost to the Exchequer of dividing the Capital Gains Tax categories into passive and active and applying a 40% rate to the passive CGT activity for example, buying shares and the existing rate to active engagement for example selling on a business, as tax returns do not provide a basis for compiling estimates in relation to the amount of CGT liability separately associated with passive and active activity, it is therefore not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy.</p><p>Regarding the final question, it is assumed the Deputy is asking about the cost of introducing a Capital Gains Tax tapering relief of 15% for new companies who hold assets for eight years. As data is not available from tax returns regarding the extent to which new companies would be in a position to avail of this relief there is, therefore, no statistical basis on which an estimate of the cost can be provided.</p></reply>

The motivation for rounding is to reduce the need for 1 and 2 cent coins, making transactions more convenient for customers and retailers alike. The impetus to reduce use of 1 and 2 cent coins by rounding total bills to the nearest 5 cent at the till arises from:</p><p>-The reluctance of consumers to use 1 and 2 cent coinsthese coins tend to be lost or hoarded</p><p>-The related cost/inconvenience to retailers of dealing with these coins</p><p>-The disproportionate cost to the Central Bank to produce new 1 and 2 cent coins for circulation</p><p>The Wexford Rounding Trial was subsequently run from 16 September to 17 November 2013, and showed strong support for rounding both from consumers and retailers. During the Trial retailers rounded cash transactions to the nearest 5 cent at the cash register, removing the need for 1 and 2 cent coins in change. When  don't knows are excluded, 85% of consumers and 100% of retailers surveyed after the Trial believed rounding should be applied nationally. </p><p>The Government has now asked the Central Bank to rollout rounding nationally. This will be done on the following basis:</p><p>-Rounding will be to the nearest 5c, and apply only to total bills, not individual items;</p><p>-It will be introduced on a voluntary basis for both retailers and consumers;</p><p>-Retailers will be given adequate time to prepare for the implementation of rounding;</p><p>-A national information campaign to support the rollout will be conducted by the Central Bank, aimed at both consumers and retailers;</p><p>-1 cent and 2 cent coins will retain their status of legal tender. The Central Bank will continue to issue 1 and 2 cent coins to meet demand;</p><p>As such, 1 cent and 2 cent coins will not be withdrawn from circulation, though the volumes used are expected to decline significantly. The fact that these coins will also continue to enter the system from abroad (e.g. through spending by tourists) will not create any difficulty. However it will be important that the Central Bank, in communicating to consumers about rounding, also ensure that tourists are adequately informed.  As rounding only applies to the final bill, not to individual items, it is not expected that rounding will have any impact on prices. However, the Central Bank will also be asked to track prices as part of the rollout.</p></reply>

Despite their design, electronic cigarettes do not contain tobacco, and there is no combustion involved. Accordingly, neither e-cigarettes nor e-liquid fall under the harmonised regime for the taxation of tobacco products contained in the Tobacco Products Tax Directive (Directive 2011/64/EU), and may therefore be subject to rates and structures of duty arrived at by each Member State of the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has not proposed a definition of the taxable product, duty structure or rate. However, I will take it that the Deputy wishes to impose a duty on the e-cigarette itself, and on e-liquid containing nicotine above a certain percentage of volume (i.e. above 0.5%). Given a large quantity of the purchase of e-cigarettes and e-liquids takes place online it is difficult to estimate how large the market for such products is in Ireland. </p>  <p>  However, it is possible to estimate use based on provisional prevalence statistics collected by the Health Service Executive. Using these estimates, it is possible to estimate the yield from imposing a (VAT-inclusive) duty of &euro;0.50 per 10ml of 'e-liquid'. Assuming a full pass through of such a duty imposition, the yield from such a duty of excise would be &euro;8.3 million. </p>  <p>  I would point out that imposing and collecting a duty on e-cigarettes would require the encompassing of e-cigarettes within the current excise collection system, which would require additional Revenue resources.</p></reply>

Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.  Local Property Tax (LPT) introduced in 2013 is a tax based on the market value of residential properties. </p>  <p>  In order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it would first be necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they currently have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of financial assets in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax.</p>  <p>  Comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland, including assets and liabilities, has been published for the first time by the CSO. Crucially, these data have been collected across the entire eurozone according to a standardised methodology. These data indicate that wealth inequality in Ireland for 2013, as measured by the Gini Coefficient, is lower than the eurozone average. The results also show that wealth is less concentrated at the top of the distribution here than the eurozone average. Central Bank analysis of these data also indicates that while wealth inequality has increased since 2011, it is actually lower than in 2006, the earliest period for which data are available.</p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to introduce a wealth tax, although all taxes and potential taxation options are of course constantly reviewed.</p></reply>

There is therefore no basis on which a definitive estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled. It is important to note that the deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage drawdowns from ARFs and vested  PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative.  The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and vested  PRSAs, which are taxed in the normal way.</p>  <p>  Regarding the final question, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that data on employer contributions to pension schemes and other pension arrangements are supplied to them in aggregate form and do not provide a sufficient basis to provide a reliable estimate of any tax saving in the terms set out in the question.</p></reply>

It estimated that by increasing staff on compliance projects such as oils, tobacco and alcohol by 100 could raise &euro;20m per annum. It also estimated that increasing staffing on investigations by 20 staff could achieve exchequer savings of &euro;12m per annum. On that basis, an increase of 125 staff on audit, compliance and investigation work targeting tax evasion and black market activity could raise between &euro;25m and &euro;75m per annum.   In addition, it should be noted that there is a significant deterrent and voluntary compliance effect on behaviour of an effective, risk based compliance programme.   The investment in the training and development of a Revenue auditor or investigator can take up to three years, depending on previous relevant experience. Therefore the full additional yield would not be available immediately. </p>  <p>  Revenue undertakes a range of risk management interventions to target and confront those who do not comply, including tax evasion and black market activity. The objective is that people are deterred from filing inaccurate returns and from engaging in shadow economy activity and smuggling.  The range of interventions has increased in recent years. Interventions include appraisals, aspect queries, profile interviews, assurance checks, enforcement, investigation and prosecutions, as well as audits.  The appropriate intervention depends on the relevant risk. The average rate of return on each type of intervention varies depending on the intervention.  In some types of interventions to tackle evasion and the black economy, such as enforcement, the focus is on the detection of drugs and fiscal smuggling where the direct exchequer yield is not the immediate objective. </p>  <p>  It must also be recognised that Revenue has to prioritise its resources and must, for example, provide service for compliance, by making it easier and less costly to voluntarily comply.  The administration of taxes and duties requires a wide range of specialists and experts. In 2015 the Minister for Public Expenditure provided for an additional 126 Revenue staff in the Revised Estimates of Services. These additional staff will be mainly deployed on Local Property Tax support, International Tax and on compliance interventions.  I fully support the provision of these additional staff.  Revenue is actively engaged in recruiting to fill the additional posts, existing vacancies and to replace critical skills as new vacancies arise.   Revenue expects to recruit around 400 staff in 2015. 148 staff were already recruited in the first five months of 2015.  The recruitment is at all levels and across a diverse range of specialist skills areas such as tax and legal professionals, data analysts, economists and information technology experts.</p></reply>

The changes involve a reduction from 1 January 2014 in the value of the maximum allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes (the Standard Fund Threshold, SFT) from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million and an increase from the current single factor of 20 used to value Defined Benefit pensions for SFT purposes to a range of higher factors varying with the age at which the pension is drawn down.  This latter change places a higher capital value for SFT purposes on Defined Benefit pension entitlements accrued after 1 January 2014 and drawn down at retirement.  The use of a range of capitalisation factors will improve the equity of the SFT regime as between Defined Contribution and Defined Benefit pension arrangements and between those retiring at earlier ages and those retiring at older ages.</p>  <p>  The Deputy might note that the SFT regime does not involve the non-application of tax relief to pension contributions.  Instead, the regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by imposing a much higher effective tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down, thus discouraging the building up through contributions of large pension funds in the first place or unwinding the tax advantage of such overfunding.</p>  <p>  The yield from the changes made to the SFT regime is estimated at &euro;120 million in 2014 and in a full year. </p></reply>

The legislation relating to DWT is contained in Chapter 8A of Part 6 (sections 172A to 172M) and Schedule 2A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (TCA 1997). The primary purpose of DWT is to collect tax at source from dividend payments and other distributions made by Irish resident companies to Irish resident individuals who are chargeable to income tax on such distributions (with a credit allowed for DWT deducted). </p>  <p>  Section 172C TCA 1997 provides that certain recipients of distributions are specifically excluded from the scope of the DWT.  The categories of persons excluded from DWT under this section include: - Irish resident companies; - pension schemes, managers of approved retirement funds and PRSA administrators; - qualifying employee share ownership trusts; - collective investment funds and exempt unit trusts; - managers of special savings accounts and special portfolio investment accounts; - charities; - athletic or amateur sports bodies; and - permanently incapacitated individuals and thalidomide victims who are exempt from tax in respect of income arising from the investment of compensation payments awarded for the benefit of such persons.  In addition, Section 172D TCA 1997 provides that the following non-resident persons qualify for exemption from DWT: - individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the State and who are resident in an EU Member State or in a country with which Ireland has a tax treaty; - companies which are not resident Ireland and - which are resident in another EU Member State or tax treaty country and not controlled by Irish residents; - which are ultimately controlled by a person or persons resident in another EU Member State or tax treaty country; or - the main shares of which, or the main shares of the parent company or companies of which, are substantially and regularly traded on a recognised stock exchange in an EU Member State or tax treaty country.  It should be noted that the exemptions contained in sections 172C and 172D TCA 1997 are not automatic and must be established by means of an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption completed by the applicant.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, while they do not have a statistical basis for compiling estimates of the cost of the various exemptions from DWT, such exemptions are provided in respect of persons or bodies that are not chargeable to tax in respect of the dividend income concerned.  Accordingly, if these exemptions were to be abolished, any DWT deducted would have to be refunded.  This would result in an additional administrative burden for the recipient of the dividend and for Revenue and, ultimately, no net additional yield to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

Regulations made under Section 32D and 32E of the Central Bank Act 1942, or any amendment or revocation of these regulations, do not take effect until approved by the Minister for Finance. </p>  <p>  The financial services industry currently funds 50% of the costs incurred by the Central Bank for financial regulation with certain exceptions including the banks which had participated in the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, which are required to fund 100% of the Central Bank's regulatory costs.  Credit Unions currently contribute approximately 8% to the cost of their regulation.</p>  <p>  The current 50% funding arrangement translates into a corresponding reduction in the annual surplus remitted by the Central Bank to the Exchequer.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it is estimated that &euro;67 million of the Central Bank's 2015 surplus income will be redirected, to make up for the difference between the costs of regulation and the funding received from the financial services industry. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Central Bank will shortly issue a joint consultation paper to canvass views on the potential for changing the current funding model.  I am cognisant of the increased regulatory burden on industry in recent years and the need to ensure that any changes to the current funding model do not adversely impact the competitiveness of the financial services sector, which is an source of high value employment in Ireland. </p></reply>

As such, the estimated cost attached to REITs relates not to an exemption from tax, but rather to the move from direct taxation of rental income in the hands of investors, to the taxation of dividends distributed to investors from REIT profits arising from that rental income.  The REIT legislation requires that 85% of all property income profits be distributed annually to shareholders.  </p>  <p>  In general, the trading profits of companies in Ireland are subject to Corporation Tax at 12.5%.  Rental profits of companies are subject to Corporation Tax at 25%. Rental profits arising in a REIT are exempt from Corporation Tax.  However, profits from any other activities are subject to Corporation Tax in the normal way. </p>  <p>  In answer to the question as to how much annual revenue would be raised by applying a minimum rate of Income Tax of 20% to all REIT income, REITs are publically listed companies, meaning their Financial Statements are publically available, but the specific figures required to calculate their rental profit (the portion of profit that is exempt) is not necessarily available in these public documents.  For reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on specific details of rental profit, if any, of the limited number of REITS currently operating in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In answer to the question as to how much annual revenue would be raised by applying a minimum rate of tax of 25% to all REIT Capital Gains, REITs are investment vehicles that are specifically designed to hold rental investment property.  They are focused on long-term holding of income-producing property.  They are not designed specifically to undertake development activities, or as a vehicle for short-term speculative gains.  There is an exemption from Capital Gains Tax for a REIT on the sale of properties from its property rental business.  It is not possible to predict when (or if) a REIT may sell some (or all) of its rental property portfolio or to predict what gain, if any, may arise on such hypothetical future sales.</p>  <p>  In answer to the question as to how much annual revenue would be raised if the non-resident withholding tax exemption was removed for REITs, I can confirm there is no such exemption.  In general, distributions (i.e. payments) from Irish resident companies to Irish shareholders are subject to Dividend Withholding Tax ("DWT").  Payments made to non-resident shareholders are generally exempt from  DWT.  There is no exemption from DWT for payments made from a REIT from profits arising from its property rental business to non-resident shareholders, as the general DWT exemption does not apply in such circumstances.  However, non-resident investors who are resident in countries with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement (DTA) may be able to reclaim some of the DWT, if the relevant DTA permits.  Non-resident investors who are resident in countries with which Ireland does not have a DTA will suffer DWT on the full amount of the distribution. </p></reply>

This CGT exemption does not extend to a disposal by a person who is not the beneficial owner of the policy and who acquired the rights or interest in the policy for a consideration in money or money's worth. Any chargeable gains arising on such disposals would be liable to CGT at the current rate of 33%.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners do not have the relevant data on disposals of life assurance policies to which the CGT exemption applies which would allow for any reliable estimate of the figure sought by the Deputy.  The Deputy should also note, however, that since 1 January 2001 a policyholder s investment grows tax free throughout the term of the policy and is subject to exit tax on the occurrence of a chargeable event e.g. partial/full surrender or maturity of the policy.  The tax deducted is a final liability to tax for the policyholder.  With effect from 1 January 2014 the rate of exit tax is 41%.  The total life assurance exit tax collected in 2014 was &euro;130 million.</p></reply>

Current and recent files are stored in the Government Buildings complex while the remainder are stored off site.  A detailed guidance manual on file management which sets out the requirements under the relevant legislation including the FOI Act, the Archives Act and the Data Protection Act has been issued to staff and is available on the intranet site.  The guidance manual clarifies the procedures and processes in dealing with data and files and is updated regularly and most recently earlier this year.  </p>  <p>  In early 2014, we reviewed our information needs as part of the ICT Strategy 2014-2015. This review focused on both our paper and digital records. A number of new information systems were identified. </p>  <p>  A new electronic Records Management System was initiated in 2014 in cooperation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and was developed by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. The aim was to provide a centralised system of storing digital files incorporating the existing filing structure but migrating most newly created official documents to storage in digital format rather than physical paper files. An adapted version of the existing file management system will remain in place for handling paper files which include documents that contain legally binding elements such as signatures or seals. This eDocs system will facilitate greater efficiencies in records management particularly in relation to the retrieval of documents and increased security and accountability for official files. An important element of the eDocs project was the assignment of Information Officers in each Division. The Information Officers have been given enhanced training on records management in order to support their teams and promote standard procedures across the Department. This eDocs project is at pilot stage and is expected to be rolled out to the wider department shortly.</p>  <p>  Another system introduced recently include a new eSubmissions system which replaces the paper system for creating and submitting internal Departmental submissions to me as Minister and to senior management. This electronic submission recording system (eSubmission) records all relevant documentation, recommendations, decisions and notes in relation to submissions. </p>  <p>  There is also a new ePQ system which is similar to the eSubmissions system which records all information in relation to the PQs received and the answers provided. </p>  <p>  Government decisions are posted to eCabinet by the Government Secretariat. My office prints all decisions made by Government and these are provided to the Secretary General.

As the Deputy is aware, before the proposed scheme can be confirmed, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER) must be satisfied that the Environmental and Natura Impact Statements adequately identify, describe and assess the direct and indirect effects of the proposed scheme.</p>  <p>  It had been hoped that construction works would commence this Summer in Claregalway but until the required environmental assessment process is finalised within DPER  it is not yet possible for the scheme to be Confirmed by the Minister.  This is a complex area and officials are working with relevant experts to progress the matter with a view to commencing construction works at the earliest opportunity.  The fact that the OPW will be carrying out the works primarily using its own direct labour force will eliminate the necessity for a lengthy tender process for a main civil works contractor once the scheme is Confirmed.</p>  <p>  I wish to reaffirm that the OPW remains committed to carrying out the scheme, subject to the Minister's sanction, and has provided for it's cost in it's multi-annual capital expenditure profiles to 2017.</p></reply>

This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  A study commissioned by my Department estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5% and increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.  The EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the United States on a new Free Trade deal includes in the scope (paragraphs 22 and 23), investment protection and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS).  The stated aim of negotiations on investment is to negotiate investment liberalisation and protection provisions on the basis of the highest levels of liberalisation and highest standards of protection that both sides have negotiated to date.</p><p>The mandate makes it clear that the inclusion of investment protection and ISDS will depend on EU interests being met and on the final balance of the Agreement.  Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of EU and the member states to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner.</p><p>This means that the type of investment arbitration system under TTIP will be a vast improvement on investment protection in existing Bilateral Investment Treaties, some of which date back to the 1950&rsquo;s.</p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s Concept Paper, &ldquo;<i>Investment in TTIP and beyond &ndash; the path for reform</i>&rdquo;, published on 6 May, sets out the context for this reform and, building on the important progress that has been achieved in the investment agreements with Canada and Singapore, sets out four areas for further improvement: Governments&rsquo; right to regulate, establishment and functioning of tribunals, relationship between national judicial systems and an ISDS system, and an appellate mechanism.</p><p>These improvements are aimed at fixing the problems with investor dispute settlement in order to create a new modern system of investment arbitration.  Ireland already provides the highest protection for investors by virtue of Article 43 of our Constitution, so the policy intention of the Commission in these negotiations is not new to Ireland.</p></reply>

The Scheme has been variously funded at different times solely by the Exchequer or by a combination of national and EU funds. At present, the scheme is wholly Exchequer-funded.  The 2015 Scheme focuses exclusively on the growing of willow and provides establishment grants to farmers of up to 40% of the crop establishment costs subject to a maximum grant of &euro;1,040 per hectare. In the light of disappointing take-up in recent years, and in response to submissions from the sector, the eligible area for planting was increased substantially from 30 hectares to 50 hectares under the 2015 scheme.

The BDGP builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years, and will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the genetic quality of the national beef herd. The Programme was launched on 5 May and almost 30,000 applications had been received by my Department when it closed on 5 June. While analysis of the applications is still ongoing, the initial figures suggest that the programme is fully subscribed.  The requirement for farmers to move towards using four and five star rated stock bulls and heifers is an essential component of the Programme. All farmers will receive comprehensive training, and ongoing information and advice to assist them in introducing the required breeding strategy. I am also aware that these requirements will take time to introduce which is why there is a substantial lead-in time included in the design of the programme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to state that bulls or heifers rated as 4 or 5 stars at either the time of genotyping for animals sourced within the herd, or at the time of purchase for animals sourced outside the herd, will remain in compliance with the replacement strategy requirements of the Beef Data and Genomics Scheme even in situations where the animal may be subsequently reassessed to 3 stars or lower as the index evolves.</p>  <p>  The intention of the programme is to encourage the introduction and retention of higher genetic merit animals into suckler farms in Ireland &ndash; it would not be appropriate to penalise a farmer who follows this replacement strategy and subsequently finds that some of the animals are reassessed at a later date as the index rises. The fact that breeding is on the basis of animals that are four or five stars at the outset means that the trend is towards an overall increase in the genetic merit of the herd at individual and national level.</p></reply>

Payments under the Programme will commence before the end of June. Under the Programme, farmers who participate are required to submit the required data on suckler cows and their calves after birth and again after the calves are weaned. The Deputy will be aware that elements of the Beef Data Programme and the nationally funded Beef Genomics Scheme were amalgamated in the new Beef Data and Genomics Programme funded under the 2014 &ndash; 2020 Rural Development Programme. In that regard, it is very encouraging that the level of participation in the Beef Data Programme increased by 21% to 32,300 participants in 2014.  In view of the increased participation level in the Programme and the fact that the Commitment 2 data (e.g. quality and docility of calf) is still being submitted by farmers in respect of autumn born calves, I have decided that payments under this year&rsquo;s Programme should be staggered with an 80% advance payable immediately with the balancing payment issuing later this year when the 2014 processing is completed. The 2013 rates of aid will continue to apply this year, these were as follows:<table><tr><th>Number of calves </th><th>Rate per calf </th></tr><tr><td>1 to 30 </td><td>&euro; 20 </td></tr><tr><td>31 to 50 </td><td>&euro; 10 </td></tr></table></p><p>The 80% advance payment details are as follows:<table><tr><th>Number of calves </th><th>Rate per calf </th></tr><tr><td>1 to 30 </td><td>&euro; 16 </td></tr><tr><td>31 to 50 </td><td>&euro; 8 </td></tr></table></p><p>It is also important that the 10% Modulation deduction, which applied to the combined payments in excess of &euro; 2,000 under the Single Payment Scheme, the Grassland Sheep Scheme and the Beef Data Programme in 2013, is not deductible under the 2014 Programme.</p></reply>

Such lesions are sent for laboratory testing to confirm or otherwise the presence of TB. In cases of this nature, the holding from which the animal originated must be restricted until a negative laboratory test result is available and will remain restricted if that test result is positive. The nature of the test is such that the process which must be followed in the laboratory to confirm a test negative result may take up to 10 weeks before the final result is available. In such cases, my Department must comply with disease eradication legislation which requires that the herd must remain restricted until a negative test is determined. In the case in question, a negative test result was available on 17 June following which the holding was derestricted on 18 June 2015.    The On-Farm Market Valuation scheme is the principal compensation measure available to herdowners whose animals are removed as reactors under the TB Scheme. However, this scheme applies only to animals removed as reactor. Since the animal in question was not removed as a reactor, the herdowner is ineligible for payment under this scheme. While the holding was restricted, the herdowner was permitted to sell animals directly to slaughter. </p></reply>

However, m<font color="#222222">y Department monitors the incidence of TB in wild deer nationally through the analysis of suspect lesions or carcases submitted by farmers and hunters who are permitted to slaughter deer under licence from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </font>Submissions of deer since 1<sup>st</sup>January 2014 from farmers and hunters to our Regional Veterinary Laboratories indicate very low levels of TB in wild deer in all areas with the exception of parts of Wicklow. </p><p>I should point out that the tuberculosis herd incidence rate for cattle in West Wicklow is 12.4% and in East Wicklow is 6.3 %, both of which are well above the national average of 2.75%. The findings in relation to the Wicklow deer study will be considered by the recently established Irish Deer Management Forum (IDMF) which will assess the findings and make appropriate recommendations in relation to all aspects of deer management for Wicklow and nationally.</p></reply>

The standard certification fee is stipulated as &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  There is no provision to waive or reduce the applicable statutory fees.</p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Every application must be assessed to establish if the statutory requirements are met.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person concerned to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware I have introduced formal citizenship ceremonies at no extra cost to applicants.  These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p></reply>

The Group is chaired by the former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, and comprises senior officials from all relevant Departments, the UNHCR, representatives of academia and various NGOs who have a long-standing interest in this area and other representatives of civil society.</p><p>In relation to the specific issue raised, it should be noted that direct provision is, for the most part, a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation and certain other services on a full board basis free of utility or other costs.  The weekly direct provision allowance - &euro;19.10 for adults and &euro;9.60 for children - is currently paid to approximately 4,500 residents in 34 direct provision asylum accommodation centres throughout the State contracted to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department.  The allowance is paid by paid by staff of the Community Welfare Service of the Department of Social Protection.  DPS staff also have discretion to make exceptional needs payments to residents in special situations.  Children of asylum seekers are also entitled to apply for payments under the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Scheme.</p><p>A specific term of reference of the aforementioned working group is to indicate what actions could be taken in the short and longer term which are directed towards showing greater respect for the dignity of persons in the system and improving their quality of life by enhancing the support and services currently available.  Whilst I understand that the group has examined the issue of payments to asylum seekers while residing in direct provision, it would be inappropriate for me to comment until I have studied the final report upon its submission to me.  The overall report will no doubt concern matters relating to a number of Government Departments, including the Department of Social Protection, and its recommendations will have to be considered in detail by the Government.<font color="#000080"> </font>The Government recognises that the issues examined by the working group are complex and required thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not undermine existing border controls and immigration policies.</p></reply>

I am advised that a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet, &quot;A Guide to the Noise Regulations&quot;, is available on the Department of Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government's website:</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that insofar as the issues raised relate to the management of multi-unit complexes, section 23 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 provides that an owners' management company may make House Rules for the effective operation and maintenance of the multi-unit development.  The Rules may make provision for the recovery by the owners' management company from any person of the reasonable cost of remedying a breach of the rules.</p></reply>

Currently, adoptions are taking place with countries that have ratified the Convention. The Russian Federation has not ratified the Convention and therefore a bilateral agreement is necessary.</p><p>  Efforts have been on-going in relation to a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation for a number of years. There have been a number of meetings with officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and a delegation from the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation regarding a draft bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation. The Office of the Attorney General has also provided advice to the Department in relation to the draft agreement.</p><p>  The Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and once adopted in Ireland the child is treated as if they are the natural child of the adoptive parents. This means that the ability of the State to intervene in a family, when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised, is limited. The Department has advised the Russian Federation of this Constitutional imperative in instances where families, who had given commitments to the Russian authorities in regard to the provision of post placement reports, fail to adhere to those commitments.  In these instances the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with the commitments given by Irish families, legal or otherwise, to provide post placement reports. There are a number of other additional issues that require further clarification and it is imperative that these matters are fully addressed so as to ensure that further discussions on other aspects of the bilateral agreement are beneficial.</p><p>It was intended that officials visit Russia in January of this year; however, it was decided to liaise with officials in the Ministry of Education and Science in Russia through the Embassy to ensure that Irish proposals in regard the provision of post placement reports are acceptable to the Russian Federation before continuing the detailed negotiations.</p><p>  Efforts are ongoing in my Department in relation to progressing this work. The Russian Irish Adoption Group is a group of families that are interested in adopting children from Russia. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Departmental officials are willing to meet with this group, should they request such a meeting.</p><p>The issue of the negotiation of a bilateral agreement with Russia has to be considered in the context of the overall priorities of the Department in relation to adoption and the general focus of Ireland in regard to countries of origin for Inter Country Adoption.</p></reply>

Under the ECCE programme, all pre-school leaders were required to hold a Level 5 qualification.  In addition, pre-school services could qualify for a higher capitation rate where all the pre-school leaders, in the ECCE room, held a Level 7 qualification, and all the pre-school assistants held a Level 5 qualification. This represented a major step forward in improving the quality of early year.</p>  <p>  Nearly all of the pre-school childcare services in the country are participating in the ECCE programme.  In 2010, a total of 3,787 childcare services were under contract to deliver the free pre-school  year under the ECCE programme. Of these 82 per cent met the basic capitation criteria, and 11 per cent met the higher capitation criteria.   In 2015, a total of 4,371 childcare services are under contract to deliver the ECCE programme with 72 per cent meeting the basic capitation criteria, and  28 per cent meeting the higher capitation criteria.</p>  <p>  According to the findings from the Annual Survey of Early Years Services undertaken by Pobal on the Department&rsquo;s behalf, in 2014 the percentage of staff in early years services who hold a qualification equal to or higher than the Level 5 qualification on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) is almost 87 per cent and the percentage of staff that hold a Level 6 qualification or higher on the NFQ is 50 per cent. The findings of the survey also show that almost 5 per cent of staff hold qualifications at Level 7 (ordinary degree), and over 9 per cent hold a Level 8 (honours degree) award.</p></reply>

The Agency&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of survivors are met in the best way possible. Accordingly, the 2015 budget is directed towards protecting front-line services for survivors.</p>  <p>  Tusla has undertaken a comprehensive review of the domestic, sexual and gender based violence services, in consultation with service providers. Tusla recognises and values the important work being undertaken by these organisations, and the considerable efforts they make to maintain services in the face of funding and other challenges. The review found that despite these efforts, service delivery is fragmented, with inequity in the accessibility of services across different areas. There was also some duplication and overlap in training provision. Tusla&rsquo;s aim is to put these services on a more sustainable footing. </p>  <p>  For the first time domestic and sexual violence services are being developed as a specialist national service with a single line of accountability and a dedicated national budget of &euro;19.5m, in 2015. A roadmap for the future of service delivery has been approved by Tusla&rsquo;s Board. The Government&rsquo;s priority is to protect frontline services, and that is what Tusla is endeavouring to do. A key concern in the context of domestic violence is to address the needs of children who witness violence in the family and home setting. </p>  <p>  Tusla has allocated funding of &euro;600,000 to Women&rsquo;s Aid in 2015, to maintain current frontline service provision, including the development of Women&rsquo;s Aid national domestic violence helpline.  Women&rsquo;s Aid receives funding from a number of government sources for the services it provides, including &euro;157,914 over a two year period from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government; and &euro;140,000 &ndash; an increase of &euro;60,000 in 2015 &ndash; from the Department of Justice and Equality for the awareness raising and court accompaniment services. Women's Aid has expressed concern over the reduction in funding by Tusla, and I met recently with the Chairperson and Chief Executive to hear their perspective on the impact of the reduction and to discuss plans for the future development of services in this important area. My own Department has not undertaken a study on the impact of funding reductions to Women&rsquo;s Aid.</p>  <p>  A joint delivery model of domestic violence training to Tusla and HSE staff, and other relevant groups, will continue in 2015. Tusla training staff co-deliver this programme in partnership with domestic violence service providers in local areas; child protection and welfare issues are addressed in this context.   Tusla continues to give full consideration to domestic violence training needs, so as to achieve the most sustainable and effective approach capable of delivering the best outcomes for survivors of domestic violence throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Tusla recognises the valuable work of Women&rsquo;s Aid, and other organisations providing services in this area. Tusla is actively engaging with the organisation on services and funding for 2015, and is committed to continuing to work in partnership with Women&rsquo;s Aid and the wider domestic violence services sector into the future.</p></reply>

A particular challenge has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person&rsquo;s request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent.  My Department has had on going consultation with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues.  I am proposing as progressive an approach as is possible within the significant legal and operational complexities which arise in giving effect to this objective. I continue to explore how far the Government can go in building into legislation that right of the adopted person to get access to information without breaching the Constitution and due to the ongoing discussions, the Heads of Bill have not yet been finalised. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to have the General Scheme and Heads of Bill finalised  as soon as possible and submitted for the consideration of Government, in advance of referral to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. This will be the subject of consultation with all relevant Government Departments in advance.</p></reply>

There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.

The<i>Reach Out</i>strategy came to the end of its 10-year term at the end of last year, and at my request, the Department of Health and the HSE developed a new strategic framework for suicide prevention to succeed and build upon Reach Out. I am pleased to say that <i>Connecting for Life</i>, the successor to <i>Reach Out</i>was launched this morning by An Taoiseach.  </p><p>The new Strategy sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and wellbeing.  This includes a greater focus on the important area of support for families and communities in suicide prevention, and will include providing community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention.  The Strategy will also deliver co-ordinated communication campaigns for the promotion of mental health and wellbeing among the whole population with a focus on protective health behaviours and consistent signposting to relevant support services.</p><p>The National Office for Suicide Prevention continues to provide significant funding to a number of agencies such as The Samaritans, Console and Pieta House who provide counselling to people at risk of suicide and bereavement support for families who have been affected by suicide.  This key area of support for families will continue to be prioritised in the future.</p></reply>

The purpose is to facilitate employees to make protected disclosures in good faith where they have reasonable grounds for believing that the health or welfare of patients, service users or the public may be put at risk, or where there is waste of public funds or legal obligations are not being met, so that the matter can be investigated.    The legislation also provides statutory protection for health service employees from penalisation as a result of making a protected disclosure in good faith in accordance with this procedure.</p>  <p>  In this context, I understand that a protected disclosure was raised by two health sector employees in March 2013, with regard to concerns about an organisation that provides services to people with a disability.</p>  <p>  As a result of that disclosure, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has been carrying out an investigation into the issues. </p>  <p>  As the majority of issues raised relate to the investigation of issues raised in a protected disclosure to the HSE, which is not yet complete, it is not appropriate for me to comment further at this point.</p></reply>

This case was raised at a meeting of the Permanent Council of the OSCE on 11 June.  The EU expressed concern at reports that this human rights defender was detained for more than 10 hours and subjected to excessive and humiliating treatment by local authorities in the city of Chinaz in Uzbekistan on 31 May, and that she was subsequently detained again on 5 June and subjected once more to a physically invasive and humiliating search.  The EU called on the government of Uzbekistan to properly investigate her official complaint of mistreatment and to ensure that those responsible would be held accountable.  The EU also urged the government of Uzbekistan to implement in good faith its national and international human rights obligations and commitments.  In regard to the position of human rights in Uzbekistan, this was the subject of a Universal Periodic Review at the Human Rights Council in 2013.  As a member of the Council, Ireland called on Uzbekistan to implement fully and effectively the recommendations by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in his 2003 report and the Committee against Torture in its concluding observations in 2011.  This recommendation was accepted by Uzbekistan.  Ireland also called on Uzbekistan to agree a precise and early date for the visit by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, which was noted by Uzbekistan.  I welcome Uzbekistan&rsquo;s adoption of a National Action Plan aimed at ensuring the implementation of the recommendations which it accepted under the 2013 Universal Periodic Review exercise.  I would strongly encouraged Uzbekistan to step up its cooperation with the UN to ensure that this Plan is properly implemented and duly monitored, in cooperation with international partners. </p>  <p>  At the Human Rights Council session in March, Ireland supported an EU Statement on Uzbekistan which acknowledged the recent releases of prisoners as positive steps and encouraged further releases.  The Statement also expressed the EU&rsquo;s ongoing concern at the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, including restrictions on political activity and on civil society, reports of torture, and the imprisonment of human rights defenders.  The EU encouraged Uzbekistan to implement planned reforms and to cooperate with UN Special Procedures.</p>  <p>  The Human Rights situation in Uzbekistan is regularly discussed within the framework of that country's Human Rights Dialogue with the EU.  The most recent meeting took place in November 2014.  The EU highlighted its serious concerns about reports of the torture and abuse of detainees, and urged Uzbekistan to make the widest possible use of the next prison amnesty.  Other matters raised included the need to cooperate with the International Labour Organisation on forced labour, the need to ease restrictions on the press, and the importance of independent civil society organisations.  The next EU-Uzbekistan Human Rights Dialogue is scheduled to take place in Uzbekistan later this year and will be a further opportunity to raise with Uzbekistan mistreatment of detainees and the wider human rights situation in the country.</p></reply>

For this reason, much of our action on human rights is conducted through the EU, or focused on the overall principle rather than specific cases. I agree, nonetheless, that this case is a matter of concern, and I will ensure that those concerns are conveyed to the Iranian authorities at an early appropriate opportunity.</p></reply>

On Monday, I participated in the Foreign Affairs Council meeting which adopted conclusions on the EU&rsquo;s Strategy for Central Asia.  I welcome this Strategy under which, among other things, the EU will &ldquo;further enhance its efforts to address the serious challenges to human rights in the region, including by maintaining and deepening the human rights dialogues with the five countries, and by continuing to provide extensive support for reforms&rdquo;.Ireland supports the EU&rsquo;s Human Rights Dialogue with Turkmenistan.  During the most recent meeting in this dialogue, on 17 June in Ashgabat, the EU reiterated its serious concerns about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan, including about the reported use of torture. The EU urged the Turkmen Government to release information on the status and location of prisoners who have disappeared in detention.  The EU also urged Turkmenistan to ease restrictions on Internet access.  Excessive restrictions on civil society and interference with the right to freedom of religion or belief were also raised by the EU.     During this dialogue, the EU welcomed certain positive developments in Turkmenistan, including the plan to create an Ombudsman institution in the context of a broader constitutional reform process.  The EU acknowledged the release of a number of religious detainees in 2014 and the most recent presidential pardon (in May 2015).  The EU encouraged Turkmenistan to use future pardons to release imprisoned political activists, human rights defenders and members of peaceful religious groups.</p>  <p>  The next human rights dialogue between the EU and Turkmenistan will take place in Brussels in 2016.  The EU has expressed its willingness to support credible reforms undertaken by the Turkmenistan Government.  </p>  <p>  In April 2013, as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland participated in the most recent UN Universal Periodic Review of Turkmenistan. Ireland made two recommendations, both accepted by Turkmenistan: that the Turkmen Government reforms the Law on Public Associations to bring it in line with its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and that the Government permits visits from all 10 UN special procedures who have requested a visit. </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, human rights issues were also raised by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki Moon, during his visit to Turkmenistan. The Secretary General welcomed Turkmenistan&rsquo;s commitment to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and encouraged the Government to address concerns regarding the detention of prisoners.  The Secretary General also urged the Government to move towards media pluralism, freedom of expression and access to information, including through social media.  The Secretary General encouraged the Government to extend standing invitations to all thematic special procedures of the UN Human Rights Council to further advance the dialogue on human rights concerns.</p></reply>

This has been widely accepted by the international community. Ireland has, in the past, joined with our EU partners to condemn any attempts to minimise or deny the genocide which took place at Srebrenica. As we approach the 20th anniversary of this terrible atrocity, we remember the 8,000 victims there, and they will be commemorated at solemn ceremonies on 11 July. The principal commemoration will take place in Srebrenica, and Ireland will be represented along with other members of the international community who will gather  together in a spirit of remembrance and reconciliation.    The European Union was founded on the principles of peace and justice, and Ireland remains committed to supporting a peaceful, secure and prosperous future for the people of Bosnian and Herzegovina and the wider region.

The day to day management of school buildings is carried out at local level. It should also be noted that the vast majority of primary school buildings in the country are in private ownership. The Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure 2011 states that the use of school premises during the school day, for purposes other than regular school business must have prior approval from my Department.  School Authorities must also comply with relevant statutory obligations.  In general it is open to local communities to liaise directly with schools regarding the potential use of school facilities after school hours. My Department issued a Circular to primary schools in 2005 (Circular Letter Prim 16/05) that was intended to encourage Trustees and Boards of Management to consider, where appropriate, the sharing of school facilities with the local community. However, the Circular recognised that the decision ultimately lies with the relevant Board or Trustees and that the first priority at all times should be the interest of the school, its teachers and pupils.  Any private or community cr&egrave;che, whether located in a primary school or elsewhere, must be registered with the Child and Family Agency and compliant with the 2006 Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations. These Regulations come under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as will the eventual Regulation of out of school or school aged childcare.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The self-assessed charge was set at &euro;200 per annum. Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect NPPR Charges, and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. Proceeds from the charge are retained by local authorities and contribute to the provision of local services.   </p>  <p>  Based on data provided by the Local Government Management Agency, I am informed that 388,281 properties are registered by their owners as liable for the NPPR Charge for 2013, the last year of the charge. A doubling of the charge to &euro;400 could therefore potentially be expected to raise in the region of &euro;155 million per annum if the level of properties liable remains unchanged from the 2013 position.</p></reply>

One of the main provisions of the Bill is the introduction of a vacant site levy aimed at incentivising the development of vacant, underutilised sites in central urban areas for residential or regeneration development. Under the provisions of the Bill, the levy will be charged on the registered owners of vacant sites at a rate of 3% of the market value of each site, with reduced or zero rates applying in specific circumstances. At this time, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the annual levies that may be raised by planning authorities in the operation of the levy.   </p></reply>

A Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) is also required before construction work commences on new non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks and extensions to, or material alterations/changes of use of, existing buildings. The FSC is issued by the Building Control Authority and certifies that the building, if constructed in accordance with the plans and documentation submitted, will comply with the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations.    Compliance with the statutory requirements that apply to a building, or works in relation to a building, is first and foremost a matter for the owners, designers and builders concerned.

Having received and considered Wood Mackenzie&rsquo;s comprehensive and detailed report the Government agreed that Ireland's oil and gas fiscal terms should be revised along the lines recommended.   The principal recommendations made by Wood Mackenzie were as follows:</p>  <p>  - For now Ireland should maintain a concession system, with industry rather than the State bearing the risk associated with investing in exploration;</p>  <p>  - Going forward a form of production profit tax should continue to apply in Ireland, but for discoveries made under future licences the form of this tax should be revised;</p>  <p>  - The tax should be charged on a field-by-field basis with the rate varying according to the profitability of the field and charged on each field&rsquo;s net profits;</p>  <p>  - That the revised tax should include a minimum payment at a rate of 5% which would function like a royalty and would result in the State receiving a share of revenue in every year that a field is selling production;</p>  <p>  - That the revised tax rates should be higher than the Profit Resource Rent Tax currently in place, thereby ensuring a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in a maximum rate of 55% applying in the case of new licences, compared with a maximum rate of 40% under the current fiscal regime;</p>  <p>  - That the corporation tax rate applying to petroleum production should remain at 25%; and</p>  <p>  - there should be no retroactive change to the fiscal terms applying to existing authorisations.</p>  <p>  The recommendation that there should be no retroactive change in respect of existing licences is consistent with both Government policy and the view of the former Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, as expressed in their May 2012 report on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration.</p>  <p>  For future prospective licence holders a clear regime is being set out and the rationale for that regime has been explained. This should further engender industry confidence in the stability and predictability of Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms and allow the industry to focus on effective and timely exploration effort.</p>  <p>  There have been four commercial natural gas discoveries since exploration began offshore Ireland in the early 1970s, namely the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads (Kinsale area) producing gas fields off the coast of Cork fields and the Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo. There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.</p>  <p>  In terms of the direct financial contribution to the State, profits from the three Kinsale area gas fields are taxed at a rate of 25%. In addition royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head. The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields. Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field or from future production from the Corrib gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987. Profits from the Corrib gas field will be taxed at 25% when the field goes into production, which is expected in 2015.</p>  <p>  The rate of tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence granted to December 2006 will be 25%. The rate of tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence or licensing option granted from January 2007 to May 2014 will be between 25% and 40% depending on the profitability of the field.</p>  <p>  The operation of the taxation system and the receipt of taxation are matters for the Revenue Commissioners. As a consequence I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the current position as regards tax paid or due to the Exchequer in respect of the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads (Kinsale area) fields, nor to provide estimates of how such a position might alter under hypothetical increased tax rates.</p>  <p>  In the case of existing exploration licences where exploration is ongoing, while we hope for more commercial discoveries, there is little point in speculating about potential revenues from oil or gas fields that have yet to be discovered.</p></reply>

The project is currently in the implementation phase and due to go live this July. The dissemination phase will then commence with the delivery by post of a unique eircode to every address in Ireland.  The Eircode website, , was launched in April 2014. This website has information on Eircodes for both residents and businesses. The Eircode team has briefed businesses through a series of seminars and are continuing to work with them to prepare for Eircodes. </p><p>A national information campaign has commenced to inform the public about Eircodes and promote their usage. This campaign will include advertisements in the national media, including TV, radio and newspapers. Television and radio ads will focus on the benefits to the public including the fact that Eircodes make it easier to find addresses. Regional press ads will provide information on Eircodes and advise locally when people can expect to receive their Eircode letter. </p><p>An integral element of the communications strategy is a Community Outreach Programme for Eircodes using networks of community and voluntary organisations, in conjunction with the Wheel and Irish Rural Link. The aim of this programme is provide information on Eircodes and their benefits to people and groups that mainstream communications might not reach. This approach will allow local concerns to be addressed locally in a timely manner.</p></reply>

An open and competitive procurement process was conducted in accordance with Department of Finance and EU procurement frameworks.</p><p>A pre-qualification questionnaire was issued on on January 2011. This invited interested parties to tender for the contract as a postcode management licence holder for a period of 10 years to design, provide, disseminate and maintain a National Postcode System. A number of companies participated in the procurement process. Three parties qualified following Stage 1 of the process. My Department subsequently received two final bids from consortia led by Capita and An Post. In October, 2013, the Government approved the award of a contract to Capita Business Services Ireland Limited.</p><p>My Department received correspondence from the EU Commission in August, 2012 regarding certain aspects of the procurement process. The case was fully examined by the Commission which informed the Department in November, 2013 that the matter had been closed on the basis that the Commission could not establish any breach of EU procurement law that would justify the opening of an infringement procedure. The Irish authorities, however, were requested to take measures in relation to the clarity of language to be used in relation to bids by consortia in future procurements. </p><p>In reply to a question from the European Parliament on the procurement process for the postcodes project, the then European Commissioner for the Internal Market stated on 14 May 2014 as follows:</p><p>The Commission received a complaint regarding the tendering procedure in question, it conducted an investigation into the matter.</p><p>After having received the requested clarifications from the Irish authorities, the Commission closed the file. Based on the available information, the Commission departments could not establish any violation of EU public procurement law that would justify the opening of an infringement procedure.</p><p>In April, 2015 in further correspondence, the EU Commission asked for additional information on the measures that have been adopted by the Irish authorities to avoid the possible misinterpretation of the language which arose in the pre-qualification questionnaire. My Department have responded to this request having consulted with the Office of Government Procurement.</p></reply>

I established the Post Office Network Business Development Group earlier this year, on which the IPU is represented. The terms of reference for the group are to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network; identify the new business opportunities for the network, taking account of international experience; engage as necessary with the public sector, commercial bodies and other interested parties in pursuit of the aforementioned objectives; and prepare an interim and final report for the Minister in accordance with an agreed timetable.  The work of the group will be of strategic importance to the future of the post office network and I look forward to it concluding its deliberations later this year. In the meantime, I published the initial report of the group for consultation on 16 June, the results of which will contribute to the final report in due course. The consultation runs until 28 July 2015 and details are available through the following link on my Department&rsquo;s website:</p><p>It is in everyone's interest that we have a sustainable post office network, one which meets the needs of the consumer first and foremost. Our collective challenge will be to ensure the future services offered by An Post and the postmasters place the company on a sound financial footing.</p></reply>

The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas pipeline network.</p>  <p>  In 2006, the CER approved a Gas Connections Policy which enabled assessment of the feasibility of connecting new towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied.</p>  <p>  The policy provides that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges. The distance of a town from the gas network is the major factor determining the costs of building a gas pipeline. The anticipated industrial or commercial gas usage in the town largely determines the revenue from gas network charges which must balance the connection costs. Uneconomic gas pipeline projects would unfairly increase energy costs for all gas consumers.</p>  <p>  Gaslink completed three comprehensive studies to assess nearly 80 towns for connections to the gas network with the result that more than twenty new towns have been connected in recent years.</p>  <p>  Under its New Towns Analysis Phase 3 report, published in 2010, the County Kerry towns of Listowel, Killarney and Tralee were assessed, as was the County Donegal towns of Ballyshannon, Bundoran, Donegal, Lifford and Letterkenny. However, the Gaslink review found that these towns did not qualify for connection on economic grounds.</p>  <p>  As the successor to Gaslink, GNI will continue to review the towns which did not qualify for connection in 2010 as well as other towns. The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p>  <p>The CER recently hosted a consultation on a submission received by it from GNI proposing revisions to the existing gas connections policy, as mentioned above. As the consultation period has ended, a decision is expected shortly.</p></reply>

In relation to the security issue, the IDP is not a driving licence but, in essence, a translation of an individual's national licence into an internationally recognised format.  The format itself is determined by international agreement going back to the 1920s, and individual countries cannot therefore change it.  As the IDP is not a licence, when a person travels using an IDP, they can be required to produce their own national licence as well.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, it is a matter of long-standing international conventions that visitors can drive here for up to a year on their national licence.  These do not necessarily have to be accompanied by an IDP, but the IDP can be of assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in cases where the national licence is in an unfamiliar language or script.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that control is normally a matter for the owner of the property on which the deer occur. On lands managed by my Department, controls may be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  In addition, my Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, recently published a report entitled &ldquo;Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action&rdquo;, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  </p><p>An Irish Deer Management Forum had been established to implement the various actions listed in the report.  The Forum itself comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas, such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, as well as representatives from both Departments.
