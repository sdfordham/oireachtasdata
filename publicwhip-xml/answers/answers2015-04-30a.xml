The final phase of restoration, refurbishment and new works at Killarney House is currently ongoing and, accordingly, the nature and extent of posts required, including their budgetary implications, have yet to be finally determined. I can confirm, however, that funding has been made available to appoint a horticultural assistant to assist with landscape works to the grounds and ornamental gardens of Killarney House.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently secured approval for the recruitment of additional seasonal staff in Muckross for the 2015 season. As part of this, a new centrally located information kiosk adjacent to the main arrival point at Muckross will be established. This will enhance the visitor experience as it will provide visitors, at the very outset of their visit to the site, with valuable information on the variety of locations to visit &ndash; Muckross House, Muckross Gardens, Walled Garden Centre, Traditional Farms, nature trails, and so forth.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-30a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015043000052#WRA01000"><p>As I outlined in my replies to today&rsquo;s Priority Questions No 1 and 2, my primary function in this case arises from the Preservation Order that was placed on Nos. 14 - 17 Moore Street under the National Monuments Acts in 2007 in order to protect No. 16 as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the Leaders of the 1916 Rising. The area surrounding the Moore Street national monument is largely in private ownership, is not covered by the provisions of the National Monuments Acts and is the subject of a grant of full planning permission by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Dublin City Council has statutory responsibility under the Planning and Development Acts for all planning and development matters in the area.</p>  <p>  With regard to the national monument itself, the position is that that the Preservation Order requires the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to be obtained for any works affecting the monument buildings. After extensive deliberations, Ministerial consent was given to the owners in April 2014 for the creation of a 1916 Commemorative Centre in the monument buildings, involving the full repair and restoration of the structures, both internally and externally.</p>  <p>  Proposals that subsequently went before Dublin City Council late last year would have allowed the exchange of two modern 1990s buildings at Nos. 24 and 25 Moore Street, currently used as a cleansing depot, in return for full ownership of Nos. 14 - 17 being transferred to the City Council.  The transfer would have been accompanied by NAMA funding to cover the full cost of the restoration project and the proposed commemorative centre. I was disappointed that Dublin City Councillors rejected these plans, which I believe provided a real opportunity to have the restoration work completed and the commemorative centre open in time for the centenary of the Rising in 2016.  </p>  <p>  However, in order to ensure the long-term future of the national monument, I have secured the approval of the Government for it to be acquired by the State. This will bring the national monument into public ownership and secure its long-term future. It will also facilitate the safeguarding and restoration of the buildings, and the development of the proposed 1916 Commemorative Centre to be run as a public facility.  </p>  <p>  My own Department and the other parties involved are working to bring these matters forward as speedily as possible and I will be reverting to Government in the coming weeks with final proposals in this regard.</p></reply>

It is understood that, since the enactment of the legislation, the hunt in question has operated a &ldquo;drag hunt&rdquo; in order to comply with the legislation. This form of hunting involves the release of a deer to set a scent over a course. Following the recapture of the deer, the hounds and horses follow the scent. As this practice is not considered to be hunting, as defined in the Wildlife Acts, officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department have not monitored the release and recapture of the deer in these situations but did, however, attend a meeting of the drag hunt earlier this year.</p>  <p>  My officials have also met with representatives of the hunt in question on a number of occasions on foot of complaints that there have been breaches of the 2010 legislation. Both the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are currently investigating those alleged breaches and, if there is sufficient evidence to support the allegations, prosecutions will be brought under the Wildlife Acts.</p></reply>

The Group will examine all of the issues at hand, including forestry consents, planning permissions for wind farms and financial supports for farmers, with a view to determining the appropriate course of further action. The Threat Response Plan will be key in ensuring the long-term conservation of the Hen Harrier.</p>  <p>  As part of this process, I have established a wider Consultative Committee which includes representation from the sectors likely to be affected by the outcomes of the Plan, including farming, forestry and wind energy, as well as non-governmental organisations.  Through the Consultative Committee, the views of those affected will be sought and incorporated into the work of the Steering Group. The first joint meeting of the Committee and the Inter-Departmental Steering Group was convened last month and I understand that there was a constructive exchange of ideas at this meeting. While I am anxious that progress is made on the development of the Threat Response Plan, the parties are being afforded some time to consider the first Sectoral Report (Forestry) in advance of the next meeting in May. It is also expected that the second Sectoral Report (Agriculture) will be provided for consideration in advance of the meeting.</p></reply>

Most land in special areas of conservation, special protection areas and natural heritage areas is in private ownership. My Department also manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 79,000 hectares.</p>  <p>  Recent weather conditions resulted in circumstances that made fires more likely to spread when they occurred. Because of the remote locations of much of the designated lands and the sporadic occurrence and dynamic nature of recent fires, it is difficult to accurately quantify the damage that has been caused to these protected habitats.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to investigate the causes of wild fires, such as those which have recently affected a number of designated sites and Killarney National Park. Where evidence is forthcoming, appropriate enforcement under the Wildlife Acts or other legislation is pursued.  My Department has taken 11 successful prosecutions in recent years relating to individuals for breaches of section 40 of the Wildlife Acts for the burning of gorse and vegetation.  Fines were imposed in all cases, ranging from &euro;50 to &euro;600.  In some cases, the defendants were also ordered by the Court to pay legal costs and expenses.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also authorised officers to prosecute breaches of the Wildlife Acts. </p>  <p>  Under section 40 of the Acts, burning of vegetation on uncultivated land is prohibited without exception from 1 March to 31 August primarily as a means to protect nesting and breeding birds and prevent forest fires. I have established a Working Group to consider all submissions received during a recent consultation process in relation to the operation of section 40 and to report back to me with a range of proposals. Any changes to the closed period as provided for under section 40 would require amending legislation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-30a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015043000052#WRA01800"><p>The Irish language was given full official and working language status in the EU from 1 January 2007 under Regulation 920/2005. The Regulation included a partial derogation to be reviewed every five years with the first period lasting until 31 December 2011. Following a review, the partial derogation was extended for a second period until 31 December 2016 under Regulation 1257/2010. Under the terms of the derogation in place since 2007, only legislation adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure (formerly the co-decision procedure) must be translated into Irish.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve the required timelines, a decision is required by Government in 2015 on the optimal approach to the derogation, following which the Council of the European Union will review its operation. A unanimous decision by Council is required before the end of 2015 on whether to extend, amend or end the derogation. The action agreed by Council would then be implemented from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of An Taoiseach have been actively engaging with the EU institutions and other relevant stakeholders for some time in order to formulate the optimal approach to the derogation.

Preparatory work on a draft Regulation is underway in advance of a draft memorandum being brought to Government.</p>  <p>  In logistical and reputational terms, it is important to note that the approach adopted by Ireland in relation to the derogation is seen to be a balanced and rational response that will have regard to prevailing circumstances and challenges, particularly in relation to issues such as the timely recruitment of the requisite personnel and the actual usage of Irish in the EU institutions.</p></reply>

Progress has been made to relocate a small number of individual turf cutters to bog plots in County Westmeath and County Galway.</p><p>Potential relocation sites have been identified for each of the remaining raised bog special areas of conservation where relocation may be required.

In such cases, and in the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive. Under article 6.3 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the site. Under article 6.4 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. </p><p>Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases.

The Council operates the sites as a visitor attraction through a body called The Duncannon Trust, which is based at the site and offers tours and organizes a range of events.  In accordance with arrangements in regard to all national monuments of which I am guardian, the Office of Public Works is responsible for the maintenance of that part of the site in my guardianship. However, the Office of Public Works has no involvement in relation to the provision of visitor or other services at Duncannon Fort.  </p>  <p>  I understand that Wexford County Council recently drew the attention of the Office of Public Works to a number of monument maintenance and safety issues on the visitor routes at the site and asked for remediation works to be done.  This work is now finished.</p>  <p>  Wexford County Council also has a Community Employment Scheme based at the site, within buildings that are part of the area in my guardianship.  The function of the Office of Public Works in regard to those buildings is, as I have already outlined, to maintain them in accordance with statutory requirements under the National Monuments Acts. As the fabric in the buildings is in relatively good structural condition, I am satisfied that the maintenance obligations of the Office of Public Works in respect of those buildings are fulfilled.  However, the buildings are, in the view of the Office of Public Works, unfit for use as a base for the Community Employment Scheme.  I understand that a recent independent assessment for the Office of Public Works identified risks arising from the electrical system.  The Office of Public Works has therefore had to advise the owner - Wexford County Council - of this and has disconnected the electrical supply.  The question of doing work to the buildings to make it suitable for Community Employment Scheme purposes is a matter for the Council, which has been advised accordingly by the Office of Public Works.</p>  <p>  Apart from my role as guardian of part of the site, and the resulting maintenance function of the Office of Public Works as outlined above, I have no function in relation to any of the activities on the site or the matters referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.</p></reply>

Despite these efforts and those of local landowners, the hare population there has remained at very low levels for the past 20 years.</p>  <p>  A 1995 estimate put the population at 15-20 animals. Since then there has been some declines, as well as introductions during the 1990s. One current estimate of the population put the number as low as 6, with another estimate at 10-15. Such low numbers are believed to be attributable to a number of potential pressures, particularly disturbance by dogs.

The final Plan will clarify whether the relevant provisions of the Directive could be applicable for any particular special area of conservation and will seek to establish whether sufficient consensus can be achieved at a national level to make a successful case to the European Commission for flexibility in accordance with article 6.4 of the Directive. </p>  <p>  Work is on-going with stakeholders with a view to the finalisation of the National Plan.</p>  <p>  This National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan responds to the central recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke arising out of the 2012 Peatlands Forum.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the complexity involved, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases and arrangements have been made as regards:</p>  <p>- Clara Bog special area of conservation in County Offaly, where 25 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on Killeranny Bog; and </p>  <p>- Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in County Galway, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on the Islands Bog and Killasolan Bog. </p>  <p>  A further 7 qualifying turf cutters from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog are being accommodated at Cloonabricka Bog in County Galway where turf cutting is scheduled to commence next year. </p>  <p>  Works have been undertaken on Lemanaghan Bog in County Offaly with a view to facilitating 12 qualifying turf cutters from Moyclare Bog special area of conservation. Progress has been made to relocate a small number of individual turf cutters to bog plots in County Westmeath and County Galway.</p>  <p>  Potential relocation sites have been identified for each of the remaining raised bog special areas of conservation where relocation may be required. When relocation sites have been assessed as suitable, my Department has been seeking expressions of interest from turf cutters with a view to them moving to these sites. </p>  <p>  For a number of these special area of conservation sites, the relocation site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there. In such cases, and in the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the Habitats Directive. </p>  <p>  This is a very complex issue with each site having its own challenges. Final resolution will only be brought by everyone working together - within the law - with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p></reply>

It is understood that since the enactment of the legislation the hunt in question have operated a &ldquo;drag hunt&rdquo; in order to comply with the legislation. This form of hunting involves the release of a deer to set a scent over a course.  Following the recapture of the deer, the hounds and horses follow the scent.  This practice is not considered to be hunting as defined in the Wildlife Acts,</p>  <p>  My officials have also met with representatives of the hunt in question on a number of occasions on foot of complaints that there have been breaches of the 2010 legislation.

In such cases where it is believed that the activity may not be an exempted development under the Planning and Development Acts due to, for example, a requirement to undertake an appropriate assessment, or where the activity would be likely, individually or in combination with other plans or projects, to have a significant effect on a European site or NHA, my Department must refer the application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a determination as to whether it relates to an activity that falls to be considered under planning law. Where it is determined that the application falls to be considered under planning law, my Department is prohibited from making a decision on the application. </p>  <p>  Ireland, like all EU Member States, is bound by the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives. This is a legal obligation and a number of EU Member States, including Ireland, have been subject to adverse judgements of the Court of Justice of the EU in relation to failures to fully comply with the Directives.

These actions may ultimately lead to court proceedings being initiated. It is not the policy of my Department to comment on individual instances of non-compliance or the modalities of how they are proceeding. Needless to say, it would clearly be much more preferable that such actions need not have to be taken in the upholding of the law.</p>  <p>  My Department incurred expenditure of &euro;34,423 in 2012, &euro;56,018 in 2013 and &euro;6,286 in 2014 for the hire of private aircraft to carry out aerial monitoring of activity on raised bog special areas of conservation where the requirement to cease turf cutting applies. Private aircraft are only used when the Air Corps is not in a position to undertake these flights. It should be recalled that Ireland is at risk of action before the European Court of Justice, with a risk of substantial and daily fines, if these special areas of conservation, which are protected under Irish and European law, are not preserved.  </p>  <p>  The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, published in January 2014,  sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. The draft Plan sets out the demanding tests which must be met before turf cutting could be consented to within the provisions of the Habitats Directive. The final Plan will clarify whether the relevant provisions of the Directive could be applicable for any particular special area of conservation and will seek to establish whether sufficient consensus can be achieved at a national level to make a successful case to the European Commission for flexibility in accordance with article 6.4 of the Directive. Work is on-going with stakeholders with a view to the finalisation of the National Plan, which responds to the central recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke arising out of the 2012 Peatlands Forum.</p></reply>

Dublin City Council has statutory responsibility under the Planning and Development Acts for all planning and development matters in the area. </p>  <p>  With regard to the national monument itself, the position is that that the Preservation Order requires the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to be obtained for any works affecting the monument buildings. After extensive deliberations, Ministerial consent was given to the owners in April 2014 for the creation of a 1916 Commemorative Centre in the monument buildings, involving the full repair and restoration of the structures, both internally and externally.</p>  <p>  Proposals that subsequently went before Dublin City Council late last year would have allowed the exchange of two modern 1990s buildings at Nos. 24 and 25 Moore Street, currently used as a cleansing depot, in return for full ownership of Nos. 14 - 17 being transferred to the City Council.  The transfer would have been accompanied by NAMA funding to cover the full cost of the restoration project and the proposed commemorative centre. I was disappointed that Dublin City Councillors rejected these plans, which I believe provided a real opportunity to have the restoration work completed and the commemorative centre open in time for the centenary of the Rising in 2016.  </p>  <p>  However, in order to ensure the long-term future of the national monument, I have secured the approval of the Government for it to be acquired by the State. This will bring the national monument into public ownership and secure its long-term future. It will also facilitate the safeguarding and restoration of the buildings, and the development of the proposed 1916 Commemorative Centre to be run as a public facility.  </p>  <p>  My own Department and the other parties involved are working to bring these matters forward as speedily as possible and I will be reverting to Government in the coming weeks with final proposals in this regard.</p></reply>

The scheme was designed to allocate scarce exchequer resources fairly while ensuring that it does not replace or displace the normal operation of the labour market, which is an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  </p>  <p>  The success of the Scheme is largely due to host organisations offering internships across a wide spectrum of work types suitable for unskilled and inexperienced jobseekers as well as those holding professional qualifications.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to change the qualifying period for JobBridge.</p></reply>

There are approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for in 2015. </p>  <p>  The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &ldquo;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&rdquo; and it is available on www.welfare.ie. The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market. The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation. </p>  <p>  In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances throughout the country, including those in the Kildare area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits as appropriate. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,000 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance. Of the 1,000 recipients mentioned above, over 530 households in Dublin and some 14 in Cork city have been provided assistance through increased rent limits under the Protocol.</p>  <p>  The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation, which is representative of the position in Kildare. The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.  My Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is also considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.</p></reply>

The means test takes account of the income a person or couple has in terms of cash, property (other than the home) and capital. The combination of the means test and awarding differentiated rates of payment is premised on ensuring that social welfare payments are paid to those most in need. </p>  <p>  With social assistance payments, the maximum rate of entitlement is payable where a claimant&rsquo;s means are nil. Where a claimant has means, the maximum rate of entitlement is reduced by reference to the means in any given case and scheme. It is in the nature of means tested schemes that where means exceed a certain amount, no entitlement exists. The assessment of means is a way of checking if a person has enough means to support themselves and what amount of payment, if any, for which they may qualify.  </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s rent supplement scheme provides support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the assessment for the rent supplement scheme is premised on the basis of need and not marital or family status.</p></reply>

The work which is underway exploring how to optimise resources and governance arrangements across the network of 93  local companies under the remit of the Citizens Information Board (CIB) has the aim of ensuring that any efficiencies  and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand  and enhance local service delivery.</p>  <p>  The Pathfinder Feasibility Study commissioned by CIB identified a number of options for greater organisational consolidation and or integration of its delivery partners.  The Board of CIB considered this Study in September 2014 and tasked a Design Group with outlining and recommending new structural models, using the Study as the key resource document to inform the process.  The work of the Design Group was guided in its deliberations by specific Terms of Reference and Design Principles as agreed at the outset, in order to identify possible new structural models for presentation to the Board of CIB for its consideration.  </p>  <p>  Following extensive consultation with key stakeholders, the Design Group has identified as an option for consideration by the Board of CIB in due course, that the 51 Boards of MABS companies and the 42 Boards of CIS companies could be consolidated across six (6) regions, resulting in six (6) independent MABS companies and Boards, and six (6) independent CIS companies and Boards, all reporting to the board of CIB.  It is important to note that any such consolidation would be at Board level only. All existing MABS services would remain unaffected.  Local service delivery and personnel would not be adversely impacted and would continue as before.</p>  <p>  The Design Group&rsquo;s recently proposed option will require further development, to include estimates of costs that may arise and potential savings that may accrue from moving to a reduced company and Board structure, together with a risk assessment.  At this early stage, indicative high level savings arising from a reduced governance structure, from 93 companies and Boards to 12, suggest there may be savings achievable in the amount of &euro;340,000 per annum. It may be possible to take any savings that arise and use them for enhancing local service delivery or indeed offering additional services. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that neither this option nor any alternative has yet been considered by the Board of CIB.  Accordingly, no decisions have been made by the Board and no proposal has been formally made by it to my Department for consideration.</p></reply>

Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum. The ARF arrangement extended the options at retirement so that, in addition to the annuity option, the balance of a pension fund could be taken in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) or be invested in an ARF, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  The ARF option was extended, in Finance Act 2000, to the part of an employee's occupational pension fund built up from Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and most recently, in Finance Act 2011, it was further extended to cover an employee's entire pension fund where the fund is a defined contribution (DC) occupational pension scheme. The 2011 extension which applied with effect from 6 February 2011 (the date of passing of the Act), was in respect of DC schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners, on or after that date, under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Where DC occupational pension schemes had been approved by Revenue prior to that date, the legislation provided that the extension of the ARF option in such cases was conditional on the scheme rules being amended to allow a scheme member exercise the option. Last year, I agreed to a proposal that the Revenue Commissioners will allow access to the ARF option for all holders of BOBs, the values in which have been transferred from DC schemes, regardless of the date of transfer. </p>  <p>  The 2011 Finance Act, did not, however, extend the ARF option to the main scheme benefits of defined benefit (DB) occupational schemes as this option was not intended for DB scheme benefits, generally. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, that pension retirement bonds, otherwise known as Buy-out-Bonds (BOBs), are single premium insurance policies effected by the trustees of an occupational pension scheme on behalf of a scheme member, as an alternative to providing a preserved retirement benefit under the scheme for that member. They are used in circumstances where a scheme member is leaving service and opts for a transfer value, on the wind-up of a scheme or where pension splitting arises in the context of a Pension Adjustment Order. BOBs are approved by the Commissioners on a generic, rather than on an individual basis, in the form of a standard bond policy document, under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA 1997 as DC products. However, in the view of the Commissioners, BOBs are not occupational pension savings vehicles in the normally accepted sense   for example, an individual with a BOB cannot make contributions to the BOB. Rather, they are a specialist pension vehicle to deal with the specific situations described above. </p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that it has always been a condition of approval of generic BOB policies that the benefits to be provided to an individual under such policies be subject to the same restrictions and conditions that applied to the occupational pension scheme from which the transfer to the BOB originated. This includes access to the ARF option. The entitlement to the ARF option, in effect, travels with the transfer value paid into the bond and the fact that the BOB is considered a DC pension product does not, of itself, give entitlement to the ARF option from the BOB as of right. Thus, prior to the Finance Act 2011 changes, the ARF option only applied to benefits under a BOB where the bond holder could have availed of the option under the originating occupational pension scheme, e.g. that the bond holder was a proprietary director before leaving service or that part of the originating transfer represented AVCs. There was no alteration in this position insofar as BOBs originating from DB schemes is concerned following the Finance Act 2011 and more recent administrative changes.</p>  <p>  In the details supplied with the question it is mentioned that the individual in question is not able to take a 25% tax free lump sum from his BOB. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the benefits that can be taken from a BOB must reflect the rules of the original retirement benefit scheme (in this case a defined benefit pension scheme) from which the fund value originated. In this case the rules relating to the underlying DB scheme that apply to the BOB that the person concerned purchased do not allow the person to take 25% of the value of the BOB as a tax free lump sum. In a DB pension scheme the maximum tax free lump sum a member is permitted to take is 1.5 times final remuneration, or a lower proportion if the member has completed less than 20 years service with the employer. </p>  <p>  Finally the issues around allowing access to the ARF option for BOBs whose values have transferred from DB pension schemes are broader than the tax policy considerations for which I have responsibility and are matters of general pension policy for which my colleague, the Tanaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Ms Joan Burton TD, has responsibility. I understand that both the Tanaiste and the Pensions Authority have concerns that the extension of the ARF option as being suggested could have fundamental implications for the DB model and potentially impact both on the Funding Standard and on the benefit promise to DB scheme members.  However, I further understand that the issue of ARF access for BOBs originating from DB schemes will be considered by the Tanaiste's Department in the context of a review of personal pension vehicles aimed at rationalising provision in this area, which review will be undertaken this year.</p></reply>

Marginal relief is determined by comparing a person's liability using two calculation methods. In method 1, the person's liability is calculated by reducing income by the Age Exemption and charging the balance at 40%. In method 2, the person's liability is calculated at the appropriate 20% and 41% rates and allowing the full tax credits due. The two calculations are compared and the most favourable outcome is granted to the person.</p>  <p>  The person concerned applied for a review of his liability online for the year 2014. On 2 March 2015 a PAYE Balancing Statement issued showing a refund due of &euro;1,684.49 which incorporated marginal relief of &euro;759.03 as this was most favourable outcome for the person concerned.</p>  <p>  Subsequent to this review, the person concerned requested an amended Balancing Statement reflecting a refund due in respect of Health Expenses. This was provided by Revenue. The inclusion of the Health Expenses did not materially change the amount of his overall tax liability for the year.</p>  <p>  Revenue has separately written to the person concerned setting out the position for him.</p></reply>

On 16 March 2012, given that Siteserv was a member of the Enterprise Securities Market, it was announced to the Stock Exchange of the proposed disposal of the Siteserv business to Millington. As per the RNS on the Irish Stock Exchange, completion of the sale was subject to and conditional upon a number of conditions including receipt of approval of the transaction from the Irish Competition Authority. After this announcement to the stock exchange there would have been media attention around the transaction.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that my officials were not made aware of the details of the transaction during their monthly meetings with IBRC management in advance of the decision of the Board to approve the sale. The Department did not receive board packs or minutes of the IBRC board meetings prior to the introduction of the revised relationship framework that came into operation on the 29th of March 2012. </p>  <p>  Under the relationship framework that was in place prior to the 29th of March 2012, the board of IBRC were not required to consult with the Minister for Finance on transactions such as the sale of Siteserv and they did not do so. </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of the new relationship framework, the board of IBRC commenced forwarding board packs and minutes of board meetings. I wish to note that the April 2012 Board pack contained the minutes of the Board meetings held on 20 March 2012, 21 March 2012, 28 March 2012 and 13 April 2012; however there was no minutes included in the April Board pack of the Board meeting of 15 March 2012, which we subsequently learned approved the sale of Siteserv.</p>  <p>  Following a thorough search of emails and documents held by the Department of Finance and discussions with the Department officials involved, I am informed that the first record relating to the sale of Siteserv is dated 23 March 2012 and was an email from a member of the public relating to media reports around the sale of Siteserv. </p>  <p>  The first Parliamentary Question was answered on the sale of Siteserv on 3 April 2012 with a further PQ on the matter answered on 18 April 2012. It is important to note that my Department conducted a review of the transaction in June 2012 so any concerns around the transaction were not known by either me or my officials when answering PQs prior to June 2012. </p>  <p>  There were no further PQs answered in relation to Siteserv in 2012.</p>  <p>  There were no PQs answered on Siteserv in 2013.</p>  <p>  There were 2 PQ's answered on Siteserv in 2014.</p>  <p>  The first PQ which was answered on Siteserv in 2014 was on 21 October 2014 with a further PQ answered on 16 December 2014 which stated that "The sale process involved two stages and IBRC was briefed after each stage. The Board of Siteserv, as advised by KPMG Corporate Finance and Davy Corporate Finance, recommended the successful bid as representing the best return for IBRC. I am advised that the Board of the bank at that time were satisfied that this was the case".</p>  <p>  On 4 March 2015 I next answered a PQ in relation to the relationship framework that was in place when the sale of Siteserv took place. On 26 March 2015, I next answered 3 PQs on Siteserv in which I detailed meetings which were held between my Department and IBRC in relation to Siteserv and also around the steps that were taken when reports of certain details around the transaction came to the attention of my Department.</p>  <p>  A further 21 PQs have been answered by me since the 1 April 2015 up to 29 April 2015 on Siteserv and details relating to the transaction.</p>  <p>  Returning to the period when the deal was first brought to the my attention and that of my officials.</p>  <p>  As my officials became aware of reports of certain aspects of the Siteserv transaction in April and May 2012, they inquired about the transaction with IBRC management as part of their regular engagement. Following initial discussions, they agreed with IBRC's Chairman and CEO (on 31 May 2012) that the Department  would review the available information on the transaction involving Siteserv in greater detail to better understand the decisions taken and the impact these decisions had on the process and the final recovery for the bank. </p>  <p>  This review by Department of Finance officials took place on 11 June 2012. Through this review, Department of Finance officials became concerned with certain aspects of the transaction and details of the concerns which were set out in the memos and briefing notes that have been released under recent Freedom of Information requests and which are available on the Department of Finance website. </p>  <p>  Following this review, on the 25 July 2012, I met with IBRC's Chairman and CEO to discuss, among other things, the concerns regarding this transaction which were raised following Department engagement with IBRC management. </p>  <p>  At this meeting, the Chairman provided me with strong assurances that the transaction, including those aspects of the transaction with which there were concerns, had been thoroughly assessed by the IBRC Board and that the Board of IBRC were satisfied that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the IBRC Board had a fiduciary responsibility to the bank's stakeholders and so, in light of this legal responsibility, the Chairman and the Board would have considered and provided such assurances following serious and careful consideration. I accepted these assurances from the Chairman of IBRC.</p>  <p>  However, as is also evidenced in the information released under Freedom of Information, engagement continued between Department of Finance officials and senior management of IBRC to improve upon the working relationship with IBRC and to help protect against such concerns arising in the future, including the implementation of the revised relationship framework and the secondment of a senior Department of Finance official to IBRC as a senior executive to facilitate IBRC's ongoing deleveraging.</p>  <p>  The senior official remained seconded to IBRC unitl the liquidation of the bank in February 2013.</p></reply>

Innovation is at the heart of building our New Economy and the transformation of the enterprise base, growing exports and to developing a competitive national economy that will secure sustainable full employment over the long term. By encouraging the development of new economic activities, the RD&amp;I policy measures in the Action Plan for Jobs are focused on strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantage and on building potential new areas of economic activity.</p>  <p>  My Department through its agencies funds research enterprise and public research activities across the full range of Technology Readiness Levels. Technology Readiness Levels are a measure of the maturity or proximity to market of a technology. Lower TRLs (1-3) include demonstration of basic principles through to proof of concept. Medium TRLs (4-7) span technology validation and prototype demonstration and higher TRLs (8-9) refer to pre-commercial deployment up to market introduction.</p>  <p>  My Department currently funds twelve Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Research Centres and fifteen Enterprise Ireland/IDA Ireland (EI/IDA) Technology Centres of scale funded by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. These centres, together with sectoral centres such as Tyndall and the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT) comprise the market focused element of the Irish research centre landscape supported by DJEI. Enterprise Ireland and SFI also work closely with Teagasc on jointly funding research for the food and beverage sector.  </p>  <p>  In relation to SFI supported Research Centres, a large share of their resources are focused on TRLs 1 to 4, supporting medium and short-term problem-oriented research including collaborative research and on oriented basic research.  EI/IDA Technology Centres and NIBRT support research that is in higher TRLs, at TRLs 4 to 8. Jointly funded initiatives with Teagasc span the higher TRLs.

My department provides SFI with its annual budget and SFI, in turn, invests in academic researchers and research teams most likely to generate new knowledge, leading edge technologies and, ultimately, competitive enterprises that draw on skills in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In general SFI funding is allocated to research areas including the areas identified in the Government&rsquo;s national research prioritisation exercise and not, per se, by research type.</p>  <p>  In delivering its mandate SFI reviews its funding mechanisms on an ongoing basis against international benchmarking, in the context of its strategic priorities and technology foresight.  The objective of this continuous assessment is to ensure that all SFI programmes continue to deliver Government policy and the strategic objectives of the Foundation and that the appropriate structures and opportunities are available for the Irish research community to support the delivery of excellent science with impact.</p>  <p>  In support of this, SFI focuses on scientific excellence and its impact across a portfolio of programmes to support the Irish ecosystem at different levels of intervention. These programmes range from supports for young people at all stages of their careers (Starting Investigator, Career Development, etc.), through to support of outstanding individuals (Investigator, Research Professor, etc.), to large scale Research Centres, partnerships with industry and others (e.g. SFI/HRB/Wellcome Trust Partnership). This mixed portfolio approach supports a range of activities across the areas under SFI&rsquo;s remit.  Individual research projects selected for funding may often span across the areas of both oriented-basic and applied research. </p>  <p>  The remit of SFI was extended in 2013 with the enactment of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) (Amendment) Act 2013 enabling it to fund applied as well as continuing to fund oriented basic research in strategic areas of opportunity for the State. </p>  <p>  SFI enacting legislation defines oriented basic research as research that is carried out with the expectation that it will produce a broad base of knowledge that is likely to form the background to the solution of recognised or expected current or future problems or possibilities.</p></reply>

The strategy sets out a comprehensive range of actions designed to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the programme and achieve the target, involving all of the key Departments, agencies and research performers. A Horizon 2020 High Level Group (HLG) under the chairmanship of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was established to oversee the implementation of the national strategy for engagement with Horizon 2020. More recently, and under the auspices of the HLG, a Strategic Research Proposals Group has been established to catalyse for projects of larger scale.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, a target of &euro;100m. was set for 2014, the first year of operation of Horizon 2020, recognising that participation and success in Framework Programmes tend to ramp up over their lifetime.</p>  <p>  Full year data are not yet available from the EU Commission for 2014.  Based on the latest data release, covering the first 9 months of 2014, Ireland has secured &euro;97m. of funding.  On the basis of this figure I am confident that we will exceed the target we set ourselves for 2014, notwithstanding the very competitive nature of Horizon 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to drive engagement with Horizon 2020, through the HLG, the Strategic Research Proposals Group, and the National Support Network for Horizon 2020 led by Enterprise Ireland.  This will include ongoing identification of key areas of opportunity where Irish researchers, agencies and companies can maximise their participation in the Programme and initiatives to mobilise both the research community and enterprise to bid for and secure funding under the Programme.</p></reply>

Central to these has been the moratorium on recruitment to the public sector and the Employment Control Framework (ECF) mechanism administered centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) which has placed challenging staff reduction targets for all public sector bodies. </p>  <p>  The filling of critical vacancies in all agencies of my Department (and indeed in the core Department itself) has been subject to the exigencies and constraints of both these initiatives.  These include a requirement, in respect of each proposed appointment, to procure sanction from DPER &ndash; regardless of whether a Department or agency is operating within its ECF limit.  The decision to sanction is influenced by the business case submitted in support of the proposal, in the context of the imperative to significantly reduce pressure on the public sector pay bill and, of course, the strategic priorities of the Agency concerned at the time in question.  When sanction is received, the recruitment process is undertaken by the agencies themselves, typically in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the announcement of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in Budget 2015, arrangements to lift the moratorium on recruitment to public sector organisations have been put in place and my Department has made its formal submission to DPER for a delegated sanction that will allow the Department and our Agencies greater autonomy in determining their own staffing priorities, within the limitations of agreed pay budgets.</p></reply>

The Government has introduced a number of policy initiatives targeted at accelerating the economic and societal return on our STI investment. Amongst these was the implementation of the proposals of the Research Prioritisation Group. Following rigorous analysis and intensive engagement with all key stakeholders, this broad based group comprising membership from academia and industry identified 14 priority areas around which the majority of competitive funding should be targeted. The areas were identified on the basis of existing strengths of the public research system and our enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and areas which can address a national or global challenge to which Ireland should respond. The Government is firmly committed to the continued implementation of Research Prioritisation and this will be a key pillar of the successor to the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation. It should be noted that research prioritisation does not apply to the entire science budget. It applies to the majority of competitive funding which does not, of course, include the block grant to Higher Education Institutes.</p>  <p>  Excellence in scientific research has been, and will continue to be, a cornerstone in the development of our science base in Ireland and this has been complemented in recent years by a sharper focus on the relevance and impact of research. While Research Prioritisation saw a greater emphasis on the economic and societal impact of research it did not represent a move away from funding basic research. Statistical evidence which supports this fact is contained in early figures from the latest survey of investment in Higher Education Research and Development (HERD). This shows that, for the academic year 2012-2013, 50.9% of the total HERD budget was on basic research, which compares to a figure of 55% pertaining to the academic year 2006/07. Policy has been, and will continue to be, to support research across the full continuum from basic to applied, through to commercialisation of research. </p>  <p>  Agencies under the remit of my Department are currently responsible for approximately 46% of the overall Government budget for R&amp;D of &euro;724million. Within this budget Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) accounts for over &euro;153million (or 21.2% of the total State budget for science). The remit of SFI, as amended in 2013, enables it to support oriented-basic and applied research. SFI manages the portfolio of programmes it operates to support the Irish ecosystem at different levels of intervention. Many individual research projects funded by SFI will span the domains of basic through to applied research. SFI&rsquo;s focus is on excellent and impactful work which takes place from ideas to application.</p></reply>

However, as both schemes are delivered under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 the provisions to guard against double-funding apply. This means that where both the GLAS Hen Harrier prescription and the Organic Farming Scheme prescription are delivered on the same land, payment in respect of both would result in double-funding. This is because both payments compensate for income foregone as a result of reduced productivity arising from restrictions on the use of chemical fertilisers. In such cases, an Organic Farmer who wishes to avail of GLAS can simply forego the organic payment on that parcel in favour of the higher GLAS payment to protect and conserve the bird habitat.</p></reply>

EU Heads of State and Government agreed that the immediate priority is to prevent more people from dying at sea.  They agreed to use all tools at the EU&rsquo;s disposal and to work in cooperation with countries of origin and transit of migrants to tackle the root causes of the current human emergency.</p><p>A comprehensive range of commitments were agreed, including at least tripling financial resources for Operations Triton and Poseidon, thereby enabling an increase in the search and rescue possibilities within the mandate of FRONTEX.  EU leaders also committed to actions to prevent illegal migration flows, to reinforce internal EU solidarity and responsibility in relation to the processing of asylum applications and relocation of migrants, and to combat traffickers in accordance with international law.</p><p>The Council did not make a specific commitment in relation to military action.  There were two references in the EU statement to possible CSDP actions.  The first concerns systematic efforts to identify, capture and destroy vessels before they are used by traffickers, who exploit vulnerable people for profit and put their lives at risk.  In this regard the Council invited High Representative Mogherini to begin preparations for a possible CSDP mission.  Secondly, EU leaders committed to providing increased support to southern partner countries to monitor and control land borders, building on current civilian CSDP operations in the region.</p><p>Ireland will continue to participate actively in discussions in the coming weeks on the various strands of the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive strategy, and to contribute to EU efforts to prevent further loss of life at sea.</p><p>Pending further discussions at international level, a number of EU member States, including Ireland, are considering the provision of various forms of assistance to alleviate the crisis in the Mediterranean. I have asked that <b>all efforts are directed at deploying an Irish</b><b>Naval vessel at the earliest opportunity</b><b>to take part in humanitarian efforts,</b><b>subject to the legal and other modalities being finalised.  My Department and the Defence Forces have already commenced operational and logistics planning for the deployment and my officials are coordinating the cross-Government issues and modalities.  The objective is to ensure we can bring the matter to the Government for final approval as soon as possible.</b></p></reply>

The specific policing strategies which are deployed in relation to these of types of crimes are of course a matter for the Garda Commissioner to determine. In this regard I am advised that local Garda management closely monitor the incidence of burglary and related property crimes in the area in question and put appropriate policing responses in place.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responding to the incidence of burglary in the Dublin area through Operation Acer, which is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region. This includes a particular focus on identifying and targeting criminal groups involved in this criminality. Burglary Response Units attached to each Division take the lead in Operation Acer and are assisted by other units as required. In addition, a further and related operation, Operation Creeper, assists in the surveillance of Acer targets by monitoring their movements and this Operation has been tasked solely with targeting burglary suspects which has resulted in the successful arrests of Acer targets. These Operations are all coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is the national operation targeting burglary using an intelligence and analysis-led approach.</p>  <p>  Since Operation Acer commenced in early 2012, I am advised that there has been 5,389 arrests, 2,746 charges and 1,087 convictions for burglary in the Dublin area, up to 3 February 2015.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that in addition to these policing responses, I am currently carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries.  In this regard I am working closely with the Garda Commissioner and other relevant criminal justice agencies to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place in relation to burglary. This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.  Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, and I am committed to tackling it on a number of fronts, and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community.</p>  <p>  Specifically turning to Terenure Garda station, I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Dublin Metropolitan Region  (D.M.R.) South as of 28 February 2015, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 540 of which there were 90 Garda assigned to Terenure Garda Station.  There are also 41 Garda Reserves and 27 civilians attached to the D.M.R. South Garda Division.  Terenure Garda station is opened 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Sunday.  Outside of these hours telephone calls to Terenure are diverted to Rathmines Garda station which is opened to the public 24 hours.  It is important to remember that while the Garda station in question has reduced opening hours to the public, it will remain as a functioning Garda station on a 24 hour basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College, Templemore, on 15 September 2014.  As part of Budget 2015, a further intake of 200 recruits in two batches was announced.  On 15 December 2014, the first 100 of these batches commenced their training.  The remaining 100 entered the college in early February.  This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College and is a measure of the Government's commitment to ensure that recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues seamlessly.  The September intake attested as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the 23 April 2015 and the December intake will attest in Summer 2015.  In addition, I have received sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for two further intakes of 125 Garda recruits later this year.  On attestation they are assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I am making specific funding available for new specialised vehicles to support an enhanced operational response by Garda&iacute; to current and emerging crime threats, including crimes being committed by highly-mobile gangs.</p></reply>

Garda members are trained in the lawful use of incapacitant spray and, as the manual makes clear, are individually responsible and answerable for their actions in its use.

However, these powers are exercised in circumstances where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a reasonable suspicion that an offence has occurred supported by some evidence.  The mere assertion of wrongdoing by a member of the general public is clearly insufficient in this regard.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has investigated a range of complaints of alleged unlawful activity at Shannon Airport and, where appropriate, files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In all these cases, no further action was found to be warranted, owing to a lack of any evidence of unlawful activity.</p>  <p>  It is not clear what evidence the Deputy refers to and if she lets me have further details in that regard I will seek the views of the Garda Authorities.</p></reply>

It will be important to learn from international experience, and I have asked my Department to evaluate how the Community Court model will work in the Irish context with a view to setting up a Community Court on a pilot basis in the Dublin city centre area.  I envisage an initial project where stakeholders will engage in partnership, in conjunction with the local business community.</p>  <p>  A considerable amount of preparatory work needs to be undertaken in collaboration with all stakeholders before the pilot project can be established. It is essential that the project is fully evaluated to ensure that it delivers the required results. Each of the stakeholders involved is operating with limited resources so the preparation and planning stages of the project are essential to ensure that the resources involved are used effectively. It is important that the project would operate in a fully integrated way.</p>  <p>  Regrettably, it was not possible to progress the initiative during 2014 due to the need to dedicate resources to other priority projects including the establishment of the new Court of Appeal and also to progress other ongoing projects, such as the judicial appointments review and the reform of the family law courts.

It was intended to visit Russia in January of this year. However it has been decided to liaise with officials in the Ministry of Education and Science in Russia to ensure that Irish proposals in regard the provision of post placement reports are acceptable to the Russian Federation.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and that once adopted in Ireland the child is treated in the same way as other Irish children. This means that the ability of the State to intervene in a family, when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised, is limited. The Department has advised the Russian Federation of this Constitutional imperative in instances where families, who had given commitments to the Russian authorities in regard to the provision of post placement reports, fail to adhere to those commitments.  In these instances the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with the commitments given by Irish families, legal or otherwise, to provide post placement reports. It is imperative that this matter is fully addressed so as to ensure that further discussions on other aspects of the bilateral agreement are beneficial.</p></reply>

More than 100,000 children benefit from this investment each year.  These programmes are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.</p>  <p>  The childcare programmes include the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  In the region of 67,000 children benefit each year from the free pre-school provision.  To ensure that the provision is free to each eligible child enrolled for the programme, a standard weekly capitation payment of &euro;62.50 is provided with a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 for children enrolled in services where staff hold higher childcare qualifications. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families.  In the case of full day care, parents can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  each year from the CCS programme.  </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to work or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the Childcare Education and Training Supports (CETS) programme providing &euro;145 per week for full day care where parents are availing of training and education courses provided by Solas or the Education Training Board (ETB).  The After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme provides &euro;40 per week for after-school care, or &euro;80 per week where a pick up service is available, with &euro;105 per week for full day childcare during the holiday period.  A Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme has also been introduced and provides up to &euro;80 a week to support qualifying parents who are participating in Community Employment (CE) schemes.  </p>  <p>  The funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years.  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children. The Group is expected to submit its final report to Government in June 2015.</p></reply>

As part of the process of structuring a work plan for 2015, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures 'sponsor' Departments were requested to identify a cross-sectoral priority for this.  My Department identified 'prevention and early intervention' as our key cross-sectoral priority.  Officials in my Department have met with representatives of the Prevention and Early Intervention Network (PEIN) and welcome on-going engagement and support in advancing the theme of Prevention and Early Intervention so that we can collectively ensure better outcomes for our children and young people.</p></reply>

Minimum benefit is one of the key principles on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. </p>  <p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women.  By way of example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women). </p>  <p>  The health services and procedures provided by minimum benefit should be viewed as a cohort of procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population, and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.</p></reply>

The Government is aware of the needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments which support choice and independence.  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new travel subsidy scheme.  Once policy proposals have been finalised and approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer.  The Health (Transport Supports) Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme for 2015.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.  Although both schemes are closed, monthly payments of up to &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme was closed, in order to prevent hardship and alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p></reply>

The amendments include an updated definition of a pre-existing condition to reflect the onset of &lsquo;signs and symptoms&rsquo; in the 6 months prior to taking out insurance.  I believe that the revised definition is clearer and will result in less claim disputes.  I have also equalised the prescribed waiting periods to be served for all, irrespective of age, to a 26 week initial waiting period, and 5 years for a pre-existing condition that commenced before a person buys health insurance.  This amendment will significantly lessen the prescribed waiting period for an older person in particular, in some cases from 10 to 5 years.</p>  <p>  The provision of waiting periods help to support community rating by providing an important tool for insurers to combat practices where someone could potentially take out a health insurance policy to avail of a particular treatment and then cancel the policy once treatment had been received, without either penalty or sustained contribution to the community rated model.</p></reply>

FASD can be misdiagnosed or unconfirmed.  There is no national register of FASD, therefore the number of cases of FASD, Foetal Alcohol Syndrome and Alcohol Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder in Ireland are unknown.  This mirrors the situation in many countries in Europe.</p><p>The Health Service Executive has advised that the number of newborn discharges with a diagnosis of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome reported to HIPE, 2005-2014 is thirteen.  Diagnosis of moderate cases or of FASD may be made at a later stage within primary care services.  Such cases are not captured in HIPE data and are not quantifiable at this time.</p><p>The Report of the Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, 2012 recommended to:</p><p>-  Implement policies and clinical protocols in all healthcare settings to prevent, assess and respond to issues arising in relation to pregnant women affected by alcohol use;</p><p>-  Strengthen FASD surveillance in maternity hospitals through the Eurocat Reporting system and promote greater awareness among healthcare professionals of FASD so as to improve the diagnosis and management of FASD.</p><p>The current maternity hospital approach to Alcohol and Pregnancy is as follows:</p><p>-  All mothers are asked about alcohol intake at their first antenatal visit;</p><p>-  They are advised to avoid alcohol during pregnancy as there is no safe minimal intake.  An information leaflet, <i>Alcohol and Pregnancy</i>is readily available.  There is an additional booklet, <i>Substance Misuse in Pregnancy, </i>provided by the drug liaison midwifery service, which contains a section on alcohol risks during pregnancy;</p><p>-  If a mother is identified at the antenatal clinic to be drinking in excess she is referred to the social work department for support and advice;</p><p>-  Where appropriate, the social workers refer the mother to the GP and other support agencies.</p><p>Currently a Senior Psychologist in early intervention services who specialises in FASD provides training to clinical staff in the West and North West area in so far as resources allow.  Any additional resources required to develop screening tools for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome or FASD, associated education programmes and specialised follow up services for children with positive diagnosis would have to be considered in the context of emerging priorities, service delivery plans and budgetary controls.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the General Scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on the 3 February 2015.  The General Scheme provides labels on alcohol products will contain, inter alia, health warnings in relation to consuming alcohol during pregnancy.</p></reply>

The Project Brief for the children&rsquo;s hospital acknowledges this key policy recommendation, and accordingly provides for consideration of future maternity hospital requirements in certain shared service areas, underpinning future efficiencies.</p>  <p>  Tri-location is consistent with the recommendations of the 2008 KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area. In 2008, the proposal in the report was that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, achieving co-location of maternity and adult services in all cases, and tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services at the Mater. </p>  <p>  With the decision to move the children&rsquo;s hospital to the St James&rsquo;s campus, these previous plans must be reviewed in respect of the Coombe and the Rotunda &ndash; the plans to redevelop the National Maternity Hospital on the St Vincent's campus are progressing.

A number of the issues raised  are relevant to other Departments and Ministers. My answer relates to the provision of health services. </p><p>The Government values the role which people with disabilities play in Irish society and is committed to facilitating the full inclusion of people with disabilities in the life of the community through access to individualised personal social supports and services. In 2015 we will continue to support the major transformation programme underway in disability services, as set out in the Value for Money and Policy Review, and in particular, the  reconfiguration of residential services.  Continued emphasis will also be maintained on enhancing quality and safety, especially through implementation of the HIQA standards for residential settings, reform of adult day services and children's therapy services, planning for emergency places and changing needs, maximising efficiencies and further development of enhanced governance and accountability arrangements. Our focus is to bring about reforms that will positively impact on the way in which people with disabilities are supported to live the lives of their choice. This will require changes to  governance, funding, focus of provision, realignment and reconfiguration of resources as new and sustainable models of service are implemented to meet the changing needs of service users and increased demographic pressures.</p><p>Funding of almost &euro;1.5 billion will be provided for health and personal social services through the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2015. Residential services are provided by almost 60 agencies to around 9,000 people with disabilities at over 1,200 locations, ranging from large congregated settings to community group homes to supported independent living. Day services are provided to around 22,000 people with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities and autism at 850 different locations by 80 organisations. Approximately 1,400 young people who are due to leave school and Rehabilitative Training programmes in 2015 will receive new placements. In 2015, an additional &euro;6 million has been allocated in the HSE National Service Plan to provide places for these school leavers and graduates.  Respite residential support totalling 190,000 overnights will be provided. The target for provision of personal assistant/home support in 2015 is 3.9 million hours. A variety of other services are also provided under the Disability Services Programme, including respite, early childhood/family support, community based medical, nursing and therapy services, rehabilitative training, aids and appliances.</p><p>The Minister&rsquo;s priorities include moving people from institutions to homes in the community and reconfiguring adult day services based on individualised and person-centred supports. In addition, work is advanced on the re-configuration of therapy services for children aged up to 18 years as part of the Executive's <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years) Programme.  </i>The aim of this Programme is to achieve greater equity of access and consistency of service delivery and a clearer pathway for all children with disabilities (including autism) to services, according to need.

Solutions must be found jointly to address a crisis on this scale.</p>  <p>  On Monday 20 April, I attended a joint meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils to discuss migration issues, and in particular the situation in the Mediterranean.  At that meeting, Minister Frances Fitzgerald and I, together with our EU partners, confirmed our strong commitment to act to prevent recurrence of such tragedies.  We agreed that work would be taken forward along three strands: reinforcing Frontex activities to save lives at sea, a fairer sharing of responsibilities regarding resettlement and relocation projects within the EU and a range of options to combat organized crime networks and human traffickers.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach attended a special meeting of the European Council on 23 April convened to discuss further the evolving situation in the Mediterranean.  At that meeting, EU Heads of State and Government agreed that the immediate priority is to prevent more people from dying at sea.  They agreed to use all tools at the EU&rsquo;s disposal and to work in cooperation with countries of origin and transit of migrants to tackle the root causes of the current human emergency.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive range of commitments were agreed including at least tripling financial resources for EU Operations Triton and Poseidon, thereby enabling an increase in the search and rescue possibilities within the mandate of FRONTEX.  EU leaders also committed to actions to prevent illegal migration flows, to reinforce internal EU solidarity and responsibility in relation to the processing of asylum applications and relocation of migrants, and to combat traffickers in accordance with international law.  </p>  <p>  The Council did not make a specific commitment in relation to military action.  There were two references in the EU statement to possible CSDP actions.  The first concerns systematic efforts to identify, capture and destroy vessels before they are used by traffickers, who exploit vulnerable people for profit and put their lives at risk.  In this regard the Council invited High Representative Mogherini to begin preparations for a possible CSDP mission.  Secondly, EU leaders committed to providing increased support to southern partner countries to monitor and control land borders, building on current civilian CSDP operations in the region.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to participate actively in discussions in the coming weeks on the various strands of the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive strategy, and to contribute to EU efforts to prevent further loss of life at sea.</p></reply>

This sets specific requirements in relation to the use of force in armed conflict, including the principles of necessity, proportionality and distinction.</p>  <p>  Outside of an armed conflict situation, human rights law must apply, including the prohibition on extrajudicial killings.  Ireland and its partners in the EU are strongly and consistently opposed to extra-judicial killings.

This principle applies regardless of the means used.</p>  <p>  Every effort must be made to avoid civilian casualties and, therefore, any indiscriminate use of drones would clearly be contrary to international law.  Together with our EU partners, we have regular discussions with the United States about the legal aspects of combating international terrorism, and the US authorities are well aware of our views on these issues.</p></reply>

The main focus of the resolution was the setting up of an ad hoc committee to elaborate a binding debt resolution mechanism. Following detailed consideration of the proposal and discussions with the EU and other UN partners, Ireland, and our EU partners, were unable to support the Resolution.</p>  <p>  Ireland, along with EU partners, engaged actively and in good faith in the process, including through the extensive efforts of our Permanent Representative to the UN. We supported the EU&rsquo;s statement clarifying the important considerations which informed the negotiating approach on the Resolution, as follows:  &ldquo;The ad-hoc committee must be limited to the elaboration of a non-binding 'set of principles' which builds upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach to sovereign debt restructuring and aims at furthering its implementation and use. Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.</p>  <p>  The ad-hoc committee should reflect the recent and ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring undertaken in the IMF, subject to the previous considerations, and should take place in close coordination with and with technical support from the Fund.  Discussions should also make reference to the work in other fora on these issues, such as the Paris Club, which has a history of discussing sovereign debt restructuring issues.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In the event, the Resolution continued to propose the elaboration of a new legal framework and, in these circumstances, Ireland, in common with EU partners, will not be participating in the work of the committee.</p>  <p>  Ireland is actively engaged in ongoing global processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring. Work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July, offer appropriate, established and constructive means for meaningful dialogue on the matter. We are playing our full role, in partnership with our EU colleagues, in working for the success of the Financing for Development Conference in Addis, which is central to the ongoing negotiations on a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals.  These major international negotiations at the UN are being co-chaired by Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN, with Kenya. </p>  <p>  We recognise the importance of continuing to address global debt issues in a development context and will continue to engage in processes, in appropriate fora, that promote constructive dialogue and propose effective and suitable mechanisms to support the countries most seriously affected.</p></reply>

The terms of reference covered all staff in the Institute comprehended by the unions' parity claim, including those staff who were the subject of a previous Labour Court recommendation (LCR20577).  The terms of reference provided for an Oversight Committee comprised of management and union representatives to monitor progress and prevent delays.  An appeals process was also agreed between the parties which could be invoked following the conclusion of the evaluation exercise.</p>  <p>  Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) were appointed to conduct the exercise following a tender process.  The selection was made by a joint panel made up of representatives of the employer and both unions.</p>  <p>  It was also agreed that, following completion of the internal job evaluation exercise, the parties would engage in discussions to seek agreement on the implementation of PwC's recommendations and the outcome of the appeals process.  In the event that agreement could not be reached the matter would be referred to the Labour Court and the parties would be bound by the outcome.</p>  <p>  The PwC job evaluation report was presented to the parties in December 2014.  If implemented, the report, which covers 182 employees, would provide for an average annual salary increase of about &euro;9,000 for 115 of the staff concerned.  The report found that the remaining 67 staff are on a salary higher than the relevant UCC salary by an average of about &euro;10,000 per annum.  Implementation of the report would add in excess of &euro;1,000,000 to the University's annual pay costs.</p>  <p>  However, in January 2015 management in UCC was informed that union members in Tyndall had rejected the report.  A conciliation conference was held in the LRC in February during which the unions sought to set aside the already agreed appeals procedure.  Management advised that it was adhering to the agreed appeals process brokered by the LRC.  No agreement was reached and at the unions' request the issue of the appeals process was referred to the Labour Court.  The Court concluded that no recommendation it might make at this time would advance the resolution of the dispute.</p>  <p>  In the meantime SIPTU &amp;amp; IFUT had balloted their members for industrial action.  The two unions have now formally notified the University that that there will be four days of strike action in May.  The unions have confirmed that pickets will be confined to the entrance to Tyndall on the first three days but that the UCC campus will also be picketed on May 13th with the attendant risk of disruption to the conduct of examinations.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that SIPTU &amp;amp; IFUT have chosen to take industrial action instead of abiding by the agreed process for dealing with the job evaluation exercise.</p></reply>

I understand that the school authority is making arrangements to offer places in this class.</p>  <p>  On 5th February last, I announced that seven new primary schools are to be established nationally in the next two years.

One of the schools to be established in 2016 will cater for demographic demand in the area referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  My announcement followed a detailed analysis of demographic data at primary level undertaken by my Department.

The Act provides that Irish Water shall charge each customer for the provision of services provided by it in accordance with a water charges plan to be approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  A new water charging regime was announced by the Government on 19 November 2014.  The Water Services Act 2014 provides that the capped annual charges will be &euro;160 for single adult households and &euro;260 for all other households until the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  Metered households already have the opportunity to pay less than the capped bill, and Irish Water will be metering all dwellings where it is technically feasible to do so before the end of 2018.   </p>  <p>  It will be open to the CER to reduce the per unit price of &euro;3.70 per 1,000 litres after 2016, in the context of determining the allowed revenue and efficiency challenges for 2017 and 2018.  The CER has a statutory responsibility for ensuring that the interests of customers of Irish Water are protected.  This will be central to the CER&rsquo;s review of all costs and revenues of Irish Water in the context of the approval of water charges and the overall allowed revenue for Irish Water in future regulatory cycles.</p>  <p>  The Government is determined that water charges will always remain affordable.  Average charges will continue to be kept low through on-going subvention to Irish Water, and section 3(5) of the Water Services Act 2014 allows for a capped charge to also be set for 2019 onwards.</p></reply>

The new PRI scheme for tyres will comprise the following main features:</p><p>- A single compliance scheme for end-of-life tyres to be operated by Repak,</p><p>- The ending of the option to &ldquo;self-comply&rdquo; under the Regulations,</p><p>- Formalisation of the existing recycling charged by tyre retailers into a visible environmental management charge,</p><p>- The level of this visible environmental charge would be set by my Department and reviewed in two years,</p><p>- As part of the detailed design of the scheme, consideration by my Department, in consultation with the tyres and waste industry, as to whether the funding model is predicated upon a front-loaded or back-loaded model,</p><p>- A full audit and registration and reporting component (&lsquo;black box&rsquo;) with a role for the WEEE Register Society, and</p><p>- An underpinning of the new regime, including enforcement and compliance measures, by a robust legislative base, including fixed penalty notices for certain breaches.</p><p>The figures referred to in the Question have no basis in fact.  The central issue here is that motorists already pay an environmental charge when purchasing new tyres, which should go towards the proper end-of-life treatment of their old tyres.  However, the contribution currently paid by the consumer is not being used for its intended purpose and hence there is a financial incentive to illegally dump waste tyres.  This results in the taxpayer paying twice, initially at the point of purchase of new tyres and again through the costs incurred by local authorities and my Department to dispose of illegal stockpiles of tyres and other forms of illegal dumping.</p><p>The new arrangements that I am proposing will ensure that all of the financial contribution by the consumer will go towards the environmental management of waste tyres.  It will also provide greater clarity, which is not currently available, around where the funding goes.  The proposed charge is therefore a formalisation of an existing charge into a visible environmental management charge.  The level of this charge will be set by my Department, in consultation with the tyre industry and will be reviewed two years after its introduction.</p><p>I want to end the current system in which the taxpayer pays twice and has no clarity on where either their contribution or their waste tyres go and replace it with a system that is based on the principle of producer responsibility for tyres which operates successfully in the majority of EU Member States.</p></reply>

Remediation works are carried out in accordance with <i>I.S. 398-2:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material - Part 2: Methodology for remediation works</i>, published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in January 2013, which sets out a clear methodology for the remediation of dwellings affected by pyrite in the subfloor hardcore.</p><p>The guidance provided by the Housing Agency in their (January 2015) clearly sets out that the survey carried out by the construction professional, engaged by the Agency to prepare the remedial works plan, is not a full condition survey and, accordingly, is non-invasive.  Any defects, damage or substandard works not attributable to pyritic heave, if such exist and are observed during the survey, are outside the scope of the scheme and should be investigated by the scheme participant&rsquo;s own construction professional who will be able to advise on the severity of the issue and the appropriate action that should be taken to mitigate any risk to health and safety.</p><p>Under the scheme, remedial works are typically confined to the removal of hardcore from under the ground floor of the dwelling and from within 500 mm of the perimeter of the dwelling.  However, where defects are discovered during the removal of the existing floor slab and the defective hardcore material, which impact on the structural stability of the dwelling and the health and safety of the occupants, the works contractor may, in accordance with good building practice, remedy such defects prior to the installation of replacement hardcore material and/or the reinstatement of the concrete floor slab.  Any other defects, damage or substandard works which are not attributable to pyritic heave and are unaffected by pyrite remediation works (i.e. the removal and replacement of the concrete floor slab and hardcore material) remain the responsibility of the homeowners.</p></reply>

The implementation of the range of actions under the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020</i><i>Strategy</i>will support increased housing supply. New house completions in 2014 amounted to 11,016 units nationally, up 33% on the 2013 figure.  In the third quarter of 2014, planning permissions were granted for 2,144 dwellings, compared with 1,409 units for the same period in 2013 - an increase of 52%.</p><p>In addition, the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>published in November 2014 sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.  The total targeted provision under the Social Housing Strategy of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 units and a further 75,000 solutions through the HAP and RAS schemes.  </p><p>The rent supplement scheme provides support to just over 70,000 people living in private rented accommodation.  The operation of the scheme is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  The Department of Social Protection published a review of the maximum rent limits under the scheme on 27 March 2015 which is available through that Department&rsquo;s website.  Community Welfare officers have been reminded of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes and in June 2014, the Department of Social Protection agreed and implemented a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations.  The protocol was extended to Cork City earlier this year.</p><p>I recognise that current rent levels are causing hardship and leading to difficulties, particularly for lower-income households.  The time-lag in terms of ramping up supply to match demand is fuelling a marked increase in rents, especially in Dublin and the major cities.  The Government is monitoring the rental market closely and is considering policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty.  My overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

A person may not dig or excavate for the purposes of searching for archaeological objects, or any for any other archaeological purpose, other than in accordance with a licence from my Department.</p><p>In 2014 I granted 462 archaeological excavation licences.  The majority of licences each year are for archaeological excavations on behalf of applicants for planning or other development consents to assess or mitigate the impact of development on known or possible archaeological sites.  My Department provides advice to planning authorities and other bodies on the need for such archaeological excavation on a case by case basis. </p><p>My Department has for many years provided an annual allocation to the Royal Irish Academy to fund a small number of archaeological research excavations.  I understand that the Academy funded seven projects from its allocation of &euro;70,000 in 2014.  I have provided an increased allocation of &euro;80,000 for 2015 and it will be a matter for Academy to prioritise the projects that will be funded this year.  My Department also makes an annual provision (some &euro;26,000 in the current year) for &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; excavations that are undertaken in response to emergency situations where archaeological features are deteriorating or are otherwise in danger and their preservation is not a practical option. </p><p>Conservation works by the Office of Public Works at national monuments of which I am owner or guardian may sometimes involve archaeological excavations.  The information and knowledge gleaned from such activities makes a significant contribution to the understanding, appreciation and presentation of important national monuments, as well as providing a valuable resource for the professional and educational sectors.  I have provided &euro;30,000 for the publication of such reports in 2015.</p><p>All licensed archaeological excavations, whatever the reason, are subject to conditions requiring that they be conducted to an appropriate standard and that reports on the findings are lodged with my Department.  In accordance with my Department&rsquo;s published policy document, <i>Policy and Guidelines on Archaeological Excavation</i>, which is available on our website, only appropriately qualified and experienced personnel are granted such licenses.</p><p>I am satisfied that the arrangements in place for governing archaeological excavations in Ireland fully reflect best international standards, in particular the requirements of the <i>1992 Council of Europe European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (Revised)</i>to which Ireland is a party.</p></reply>

However, there are a number of ways in which my Department is made aware of possible risk to sites or heritage buildings, one of these being the receipt of applications for funding for their repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding.</p><p>In that regard, funding for the protection of heritage sites and buildings will continue to be provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.  In February, I announced an allocation of &euro;624,000 for the <i>Structures at Risk Fund 2015</i>,<i></i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Since 2010 over 100 structures have been conserved through this scheme.</p><p>In addition, my Department often receives information relating to existing or potential risks to sites or heritage buildings from local authorities, the Heritage Council, heritage-based NGOs and members of the public. </p><p>Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of the architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>The Record of Monuments and Places, as established under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994, provides legal protection for up to 130,000 known monuments of archaeological interest.  My Department records all reports received of damage to monuments listed in the Record, whether deliberate interference or natural deterioration.  Serious cases of illegal damage to monuments listed in the Record are forwarded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  A number of cases relating to breach of the National Monuments Acts have come before the Courts in the last few years with significant penalties imposed on conviction.  In any case where a monument which is, in my opinion, of national importance is in danger I may make a preservation order in respect of it. While my Department will advise landowners regarding protection of monuments on their land, I do not have a duty to maintain monuments other than where they are in my ownership or guardianship under the National Monuments Acts. </p><p>Natura 2000 is the centrepiece of EU nature and biodiversity policy. It is an EU-wide network of nature protection areas established under the 1992 Habitats Directive.  The aim of the network is to assure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats.  It is comprised of special areas of conservation (SACs) (also referred to as sites of community importance in the EU context) designated by Member States under the Habitats Directive and special protection areas (SPAs) which are designated under the 1979 Birds Directive. </p><p>Ireland has publicly advertised some 429 SACs and 154 SPAs.  Legal protections, consummate with those set out in the Birds and Habitats Directives, have applied to the sites since initially proposed for designation and Ireland&rsquo;s planning and environmental legislation has operated under these designations.</p></reply>

One of the core objectives of the programme is to encourage and facilitate participation by, and the inclusion of, the citizens of Ireland to the greatest extent possible in the programme of events to commemorate this significant centenary.</p><p>The programme is underpinned by five intersecting and overlapping themes: Remembering, Reconciling, Presenting, Imagining and Celebrating.  The programme comprises seven strands: State Ceremonial, Historical Reflection, An Teanga Bheo, Youth and Imagination, Cultural Expression, Community Participation and Global and Diaspora.  It outlines a range of activities and events already planned under each of the seven strands and full details about the work being undertaken under each strand is outlined on the website .</p><p>The development of the centenary programme has been informed by the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations, the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations and an extensive consultation, engagement and planning process, which has already been underway for several months and will continue until the end of this year.  The purpose of the process is to inform, to stimulate debate and discussion about the events of 1916 and to foster programme initiatives.  The consultation process involves a range of Government Departments and agencies, relatives, local authorities, local community groups, schools and universities, the Diaspora, historians and historical societies, as well as interested individuals and organisations.  The strength of local community involvement and the unique perspectives and creative ideas of the participating groups and citizens will ensure that the significant events of 1916 will be brought to life and made interesting and relevant for people of all ages on the island of Ireland and abroad.  </p><p>Some of the events and projects detailed in the programme are Dublin-based, particularly some of the State ceremonial events, given the very significant role that key buildings and locations in Dublin played in the 1916 Easter Rising.  However, it should also be noted that Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme is very much a national programme and a range of events is planned across the country for 2016, including a number of State ceremonial events.  </p><p>In addition, the Community Participation programme strand will be led by local authorities and I have allocated funding of &euro;1 million in 2015 to support this overall process.  A series of public meetings is currently being undertaken in each county, at which members of the public can come together to hear about Ireland 2016, meet those involved in their community, and to explore and learn about how they can get involved.  I have requested that local authorities consult widely with local interest groups and community organisations, historical societies, schools and youth organisations, other stakeholders and members of the authority in relation to the selection of initiatives and development of county plans. Each local authority is expected to publish its plans in October 2015.</p></reply>

The Youth and Imagination strand of the programme places children and young people at the heart of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme.  It provides a platform to our children and young people to articulate their views on the events and ideals of 1916.  Through creative and innovative initiatives, children will be guided upon a journey to explore the aspirations and principles of the participants in the Rising.  They will be inspired to reflect on the ideals of the Proclamation and, in an action-learning context, to write their own new proclamation for 2016, to reflect the values, hopes and dreams of their generation.</p>  <p>  Work will continue with the Thomas Meagher Foundation, which has been engaged in the provision of the National Flag to secondary schools around the country. In addition, special flag ceremonies will be held at which the National Flag will be presented to every national school in the country by a member of the Defence Forces.  Drama, film, art and music will all feature prominently in the Youth and Imagination strand of the programme so that learning moves from the remote pages of history books to become real, vivid and inviting.  </p>  <p>  Children and young people will also be encouraged under the &lsquo;1916 Ancestry Project&rsquo; to look to the past, tracing a family tree back to 1916 and exploring what life was like during that time.  Intergenerational and community learning will be central to this journey of discovery and children will be invited to engage with local historical societies, active retirement groups and relatives of those who fought in the Rising, as well as exploring the abundance of online and archival material available.  </p>  <p>  Proclamation Day will take place on 15th March 2016.  The day will begin with the raising of the National Flag, followed by a reading of the Proclamation.

The changes have been welcomed by the industry and were developed following consultations between my Department, the Irish Film Board and the Department of Finance. The intention is to ensure that Ireland remains competitive in attracting film projects.

Our heritage assets continue to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits throughout the country.  In this regard, figures available for 2013 show that some 3.5 million overseas visitors engaged in cultural activities while in Ireland.  Almost 2.5 million tourists visited historic houses or castles, with over 1.5 million visited our archaeological monuments.  In 2013, there were over 4.1 million visitors to heritage sites where the Office of Public Works provides a guide service.  While the promotion and development of tourism is the responsibility of Ireland&rsquo;s National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, my Department is committed to exploring the role Ireland&rsquo;s unique heritage has to play in promoting Ireland at home and abroad.</p><p>In 2015 my Department&rsquo;s voted allocation will fund, inter alia, the activities of the Heritage Council, whose mission is to engage and advocate a wider appreciation of heritage.  My Department continues to engage with the expansion of access and improvement of facilities at our National Parks and Nature Reserves.  The grant-aiding for conservation of the country&rsquo;s built heritage is carried out via a number of programmes, which includes the provision of funding to the Office of Public Works for the conservation, presentation and promotion of the State&rsquo;s heritage portfolio.  Under the <i>Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015 &ndash; Towards a Sustainable Future: Delivering Quality within the Built Environment</i>, my Department continues to support initiatives which promotes awareness of architecture and the built environment.  This includes supporting the Irish Architecture Foundation in operating the highly successful <i>Open House</i>events.</p><p>If the Deputy requires more detail on specific programmes or plans, I will be happy to provide this information.</p></reply>
