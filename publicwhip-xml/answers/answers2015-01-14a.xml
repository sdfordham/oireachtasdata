In turn, the Defence Forces would provide information and knowledge from its own experience on the use and application of innovative civilian technologies in the military sphere. </p><p>  A policy framework and the requisite procedures to support this co-operation have been agreed between Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Defence. </p><p>  The Defence Forces now participate with Irish based companies, research and training institutions, which have the capacity to contribute to Defence Forces capability and capacity development.  In addition, subject to the provisions of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions Act) 2010, the Defence Forces also participate in relevant capability development projects at European level under the umbrella of the European Defence Agency. </p><p>  Defence Forces military capabilities are never used in violation of human rights.  </p></reply>

The Reserve is now organised alongside the Permanent Defence Force, within a more efficient single force structure.  There have been no recommendations relating to the introduction of employment protection legislation for members of the Reserve Defence Force and I can see no basis for such a recommendation.  The minimum training requirements Reservists must meet have been in place for many years and there has been no increase in the level of training arising from the implementation of the reorganisation and the introduction of the single force structure.   </p><p>  Ensuring an appropriate balance between voluntary activities and work and home life is a key challenge that is common to individuals involved in many voluntary organisations throughout the State.  I am aware that some members of the Reserve have expressed concerns that proposed attendance requirements, including attendance at medical exams and fitness tests, would require them to take excessive time off work.  They see employment protection legislation as a way to facilitate this attendance.  I believe that such attendance requirements reflect a reasonable level of commitment that is achievable for the vast majority of Reservists.  However, any concerns about attendance targets will be considered as part of the process in arranging attendance requirements. </p><p>  With regard to the issue of retention rates, the Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force identified significant issues relating to the turnover of Reservists.  Poor retention rates were found to cause inherent inefficiency in the Reserve training system.    </p><p>  I am informed that whilst a degree of caution must be taken when making comparisons with the armed forces in other jurisdictions owing to wide variances between countries in terms of standards, roles and taskings, poor retention rates are not unique to Ireland.  Other countries struggle with retention of Reserve personnel in their Defence Forces and face similar challenges with recruitment, retention and the training of Reservists to appropriate standards.       </p></reply>

A further five Defence Forces medical personnel, one doctor and four medics recently deployed to the UK on Tuesday 6<sup>th</sup>of January for mission specific pre-deployment training.  These personnel are due in Sierra Leone shortly to commence a three month deployment.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) formerly<font color="#373A36"> </font>the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the statutory authority with responsibility for the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines in Ireland.  There are three anti-malarial medications licensed by the HPRA, in use in the Defence Forces, namely Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline.  The malaria chemoprophylactic agent of choice by the Irish Defence Forces for use in Sub-Saharan Africa (which includes Sierra Leone) continues to be Lariam.<br/><br/>The choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues.  The choice of medication for the particular mission in Sierra Leone is a medical decision made by Defence Forces Medical Officers having regard to the efficacy of particular medications, the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. <br/><br/>The deployment by the Irish Defence Forces is in co-operation with the U.K. Defence Forces.  The medication being prescribed by the UK Defence Forces for their personnel is Malarone.  The choice of malaria chemoprophylaxis for use by other armed forces is an internal matter for those forces.  It would be inappropriate for the Irish Defence Forces to comment on other Nations policy in this regard.<br/><br/>Former Ministers for Defence have had the various allegations surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces.  Anti-malarial medications must remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have the most effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.<br/><br/>Since 2003, the Garda&iacute; have requested support from the Defence Forces at Shannon Airport and in 2014 there were a total of 372 such deployments.  The costs of these operations, which include Security Duty Allowance, rations and fuel were &euro;180,913 in 2014. <br/><br/>I am satisfied with existing arrangements and I have no plans to recommend any changes.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-14a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011400050#WRA01400"><p>The Defence Forces have a long association with peacekeeping missions in Africa.  The work carried out by Irish personnel deployed with such missions represents an important contribution to the peace and security of the region.  Ireland is currently contributing four personnel to the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO).  Ireland has participated in MONUSCO since its establishment in 2010.  Prior to that, from 2001 to 2010, Defence Forces personnel served with the United Nations Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), the first UN mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).  </p><p>  In common with all other UN members, Ireland received a general request in 2007 for a range of capabilities for the United Nations &ndash; African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID).  However, the Defence Forces did not have the required assets (heavy lift equipment etc).  Ireland offered to nominate up to eight (8) personnel to staff appointments at the Force HQ.  However, the offer was not taken up by the UN at the time.   </p><p>  With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.  However, due to Ireland&rsquo;s own current level of commitment in overseas peacekeeping operations, notably to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Golan Heights and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, we are not in a position to make any significant commitment to other missions at this time.  The current contribution of some 426 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security. </p></reply>

Arising from the comprehensive review of expenditure in 2011, the Government decided to stabilise the strength of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) at 9,500 personnel.  Resulting from the revised strength ceiling, a major re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force was initiated.  Key aspects of the reorganisation included the consolidation of three under-strength Army Brigades into two full strength Brigades, the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated redeployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.   </p><p>  All of these measures have ensured that the Permanent Defence Force continues to deliver required operational outputs for all approved Aid to the Civil Power and approved Aid to the Civil Authority requests.  The Permanent Defence Force also continues to meet Government requirements for overseas peace support operations.  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment is also available for deployments in response to emergencies and crises.   </p><p>  Looking to the future, a new White Paper on Defence is currently being prepared.  This will set out the Defence policy framework for the next decade having regard to an assessment of the future security environment.  The identification of future capability priorities is also a key part of the ongoing process.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces can continue to fulfil all roles assigned by the Government.    </p></reply>

Defence policy is a critical aspect of Government policy and I am determined to ensure that the new White Paper fully addresses the Defence response to future security challenges and associated resource requirements in a comprehensive way.  Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering likely future operational demands and the defence capabilities required to meet these demands.  This work will inform recommendations regarding defence provision. <br/><br/>I have received an initial draft outline of the White Paper and this will be further developed and refined over the coming months.<br/><br/>I have decided to establish an external Advisory Group to further support me in the production of the White Paper.  I have recently approved the terms of reference for this group and appointed Mr. John Minihan to act as chairman.  I hope to appoint the remaining members of the Group shortly.<br/><br/>I anticipate that the final draft of the White Paper will be submitted to Government for approval by the summer recess.  Subject to Government approval, the White Paper on Defence will then be published.</p></reply>

In the Haddington Road Agreement the Government reaffirmed its commitment that public service pay and any related issues will not be revisited over the lifetime of the Agreement, subject to compliance with the terms of the Agreement.  Crucially, there was no cut to the basic pay of any enlisted personnel under that Agreement.  I presume that the Deputy is referring to the Government Decision on the Department of Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Review of Allowances and Premium Payments which recognised that there are possible weaknesses in the pay structures applicable in the Defence Forces as these structures have evolved over very many years and have become increasingly complex.  It was therefore decided that a review of the overall pay structures for the Defence Forces is merited, in the medium term, to ensure that the pay structure is appropriate and cost effective for a modern military force.   </p><p>  It is my intention that such a review of pay structures will take place after the reviews of Security Duty Allowance and Technical Pay, currently being conducted as part of the Defence Sector Action Plan under the Croke Park Agreement, have been completed.   </p><p>  It is of course also open to the Representative Associations of the members of the PDF, subject to the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and the Haddington Road Agreement, to avail of the mechanisms in place should they wish to pursue any particular concerns in relation to the pay and conditions of their members.  </p></reply>

The role of the Air Corps as set out in the White Paper is to provide a range of military and non-military services in support of the State.  These supports include maintenance of a general helicopter capability for a variety of tasks, including support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as provision of a maritime patrol service, a ministerial air transport service, an air ambulance service on the basis of agreed arrangements with the Department of Health, and the provision of assistance to the principal response agencies, including the Irish Coast Guard, in relation to civil emergencies.    </p><p>  The preparation of a new White Paper on Defence is one of my key priorities.  The White Paper process, which is ongoing, is intended to provide an opportunity to examine critically future demands and consider how to best meet associated operational requirements across the Defence Forces. </p><p>  Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering likely future operational demands.

Discussions have been taking place with the Representative Association, with regards to their claim, under a special Subcommittee of Conciliation Council.  As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration. <br/><br/>  As Military life places unique physical and psychological demands on individuals it is necessary that its members be physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations and to undertake their duties on deployment overseas<font color="#555555">.  I</font>t is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised.  As such, in order to maintain the age profile of the PDF to carry out the operational tasks required by Government, it is necessary to have a constant input of recruits into the PDF.  The maximum age for personnel who have enlisted in the PDF post 1 January 1994 provides the mechanism through which a satisfactory age profile can be achieved. <br/><br/>  While there was significant progress made in recent discussions between PDFORRA and Civil and Military Management on this issue, it was not possible to reach full agreement.  As a result, the issue is being referred to third party adjudication for a ruling.  It is planned that the adjudication hearing will take place on 30 January 2015, following the exchange of submissions between the parties.In the meantime work is continuing on exit support measures to support those due to be discharged.  A number of military courses and other skills courses are already accredited with various third level institutions and professional bodies.  In addition, a comprehensive training course to aid transition to civilian life for these personnel, which involves a skills appraisal and review of a person&rsquo;s service history and training already provided, is currently being piloted. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality is defined by non-participation in a military alliance or mutual-defence arrangements.  Irish Governments have never interpreted neutrality as meaning that Ireland stands aside from international engagement.  Rather, participation strengthens our ability to make an effective contribution to the promotion of global peace, security and development, whether through the UN, the EU or our own bilateral actions.  Ireland acts in an objective and even handed manner in accordance with international norms and the rule of law in international relations and is seen as both an impartial and effective actor in its international relations and in support of international peace and security.  None of the issues raised by the Deputy compromise or conflict in any way, with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality.   </p><p>  Ireland has made over-flight and landing facilities at Shannon Airport available to the United States for well over 50 years.  The current arrangements are fully consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under successive Resolutions of the UN Security Council. </p><p>  While the Lisbon Treaty states that Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities, it imposes no obligation in this regard nor can the Union require any Member State to increase expenditure or investment on defence.  The amount a Member State spends on defence and the nature of its military capabilities are solely a matter for national decision and the EU has no role or competence in the matter. </p><p>  The provisions in the legal guarantees, secured by Ireland and attached to the Lisbon Treaty, clearly state that the Lisbon Treaty &quot;does not affect the right of Ireland or any other Member State to determine the nature and volume of its defence and security expenditure and the nature of its defence capabilities&quot;. Therefore, there is no requirement under the Lisbon Treaty for increased spending on defence.    </p></reply>

The current Defence Forces contingent, the 46th Irish Infantry Group UNDOF, comprises 130 troops and consists of a Force Reserve Company and support elements. Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility. In that capacity, in August 2014, the Irish contingent dealt with several incidents as requested by the Force Commander UNDOF. The Golan situation remains volatile as Syrian Arab Armed Forces and Anti Government Armed Elements continue to clash within the Area of Separation. The threat to Defence Forces personnel serving in Golan Heights on the Israeli occupied side is assessed as MODERATE and on the Syrian side is assessed as SUBSTANTIAL.  Eight (8) other Defence Forces personnel are also deployed in UNDOF Headquarters, Camp Ziouani, including the Acting Force Commander Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon. <br/><br/>Last September, given events on the ground, I called for the UN to undertake a review of the mission, particularly the capacity of the mission to fulfil its mandate in light of the civil war in Syria. Since then there has been a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimising unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate. The UN continues to review the mission and will provide regular updates on the mission to the Security Council in this regard.<br/><br/>During my visit to the Middle East last month, I had the opportunity of meeting the then Force Commander UNDOF, Lieutenant General Singha, and the Irish troops serving with the mission. The visit also afforded me an opportunity to see, at first hand, the dedication and professionalism of military personnel and the tremendous work done overseas by the Irish Defence Forces. I conveyed to the troops our deep appreciation for the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service.</p></reply>

It has not been cut, and the 2015 iteration of the plan is expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>  Within the Intreo activation process managed by the Department of Social protection, a Personal Progression Plan is developed with each Jobseeker. Participation in a training, education, or development programme may form part of this development plan. At any time in the activation process, including on exiting a programme, a Jobseeker may seek a meeting with his/her Case Officer/Mediator to discuss potential next steps in their journey back to employment.  </p><p>  As part of a structured engagement with the enterprise sector to maximise recruitment from the Live Register, the Department undertook a series of activities and events in 2014 to deliver on the measures under Pathways to Work. The national employer relations team and divisional employer liaison teams work closely with employers and industry bodies on an ongoing basis to support engagement with job seekers and the Department&rsquo;s employer services. In addition the www.jobsIreland.ie website is being redeveloped/ upgraded to better respond to employer and client needs via a new job matching system on a successor site which should be in place by late 2015.</p><p>  As an example of this kind of engagement, officials from my Department met with Irish Water and the main contractors selected for the Water Metering Installation in 2013/2014 and provided information on the services and supports available for employers through the Intreo service.  </p><p>  In addition Irish Water has advertised over 320 positions for roles in Irish Water through the Department&rsquo;s Jobs Ireland service &ndash; www.jobsireland.ie.  This includes 11 vacancies which are currently available. The Department assisted the contractors in meeting their obligations under the social clause in their contracts.</p><p>  Finally, the public service provides significant entry-level employment opportunities to those on the Live Register. The current legislative and regulatory framework for most public service recruitment is underpinned by the principle of merit-based recruitment which precludes discrimination against applicants from the Live Register. The recently-announced end to the public service recruitment moratorium from 1st January may provide an opportunity to consider how best the public sector in its recruitment activities can support Government policy around activation.</p></reply>

This process has involved building advocacy capacity and skills within Citizens Information Services to deliver advocacy to all citizens, including those with a disability who are able to access mainstream services. </p><p>  In 2009, an evaluation report on the community and voluntary sector advocacy programme set out a proposed structure for the roll out of advocacy services, and recommended the establishment of a single service to provide improved advocacy services to people who need them, regardless of location, disability type or level of vulnerability.  Following on from this report, the National Advocacy Service was established under the Citizens Information Board in January 2011, to provide an independent, confidential, and free representative advocacy service to vulnerable people with disabilities who cannot self-advocate, while supporting others to use mainstream services.</p><p>  The aim of the National Advocacy Service is to ensure that people with disabilities have a voice and that their rights are safeguarded, particularly those who cannot self-advocate or  who find themselves isolated in the community or living in residential institutions. </p><p>  More recently, the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities has been restructured to form one National Service under a National Advocacy Service Board.

The main FAS/Solas programmes of relevance to DSP clients are Specific Skills Training, Traineeships, Local Training Initiatives, and training for people with disabilities through Specialist Training Providers. In 2014 seven hundred and fifty eight places were provided by F&Aacute;S/Solas in Kilkenny.<br/><br/>MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, is part of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>initiative. It was rolled out by the Department of Education and Skills in 2013. MOMENTUM supports the provision of free education and training projects to allow long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors. Details of MOMENTUM courses offered in Kilkenny in 2014 are shown in the table below.<table><tr><th>Momentum Courses offered in Kilkenny-2014 </th><th>Number of Places available</th><th>Numbers referred</th><th>Learners recruited</th></tr><tr><td>Hospitality and Tourism</td><td>24</td><td>36</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Early Childhood Care and Education</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Looking Forward 2- Warehousing and Logistics</td><td>16</td><td>29</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Tourism Today</td><td>24</td><td>29</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Coach Driving with Guiding</td><td>24</td><td>44</td><td>24</td></tr></table><br/><br/>Those wishing to upskill or return to work who are long-term unemployed can undertake re-training on a full-time basis and generally qualify either for a Solas training allowance or for support from the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Back to Education Allowance scheme. Where the training is part-time or of shorter duration, support may be provided under the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;amp;D). Details of education courses offered in Kilkenny in 2014 are shown in the table below.<table><tr><th>Numbers currently on Education courses in County Kilkenny as 3/1/15</th><th>Kilkenny LO</th><th>Thomastown LO</th><th>Total</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Springboard</td><td><div>21</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>22</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Back to Education Allowance</td><td><div>197</div></td><td><div>51</div></td><td><div>248</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part-time Education Option</td><td><div>35</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>43</div></td><td></td></tr></table>In conjunction with these programmes, there is also ongoing engagement between Intreo Offices and Education and Training Boards (ETBs) to ensure that training programmes are relevant to the needs of the unemployed. More generally, substantial reform is being undertaken in the education and training sector to ensure programmes are relevant to the needs of learners and employers. <br/><br/>When taken together these reforms and initiatives constitute a comprehensive approach to the reskilling of the unemployed.</p></reply>

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. There are currently approximately 5,800 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, of which some 2,490 are on the Live Register, representing a small minority of less than 1% of the total number on the Live Register.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas:</p><p>  - Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrower;</p><p>  - A social housing response sponsored by local authorities;</p><p>  - Comprehensive advice to borrowers; and</p><p>  - Personal Insolvency Reform. </p><p>  In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem. Discontinuation of entitlement to the mortgage interest supplement (MIS) scheme was introduced for all new applicants from 1 January 2014. Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018. </p><p>  It is expected that during the four year period, existing customers will no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders, exit strategies sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or through securing employment. The Department of Social Protection provides a range of employment supports to jobseekers, including persons currently on mortgage interest supplement. Supports include career advice and guidance, information on and access to suitable further education and training opportunities, advice on employment incentives and supports and access to internships and employment programmes.</p><p>  Where a jobseeker in receipt of mortgage interest supplement takes up temporary employment greater than 30 hours per week and does not qualify for the supplement, they may have their payment generally suspended for up to 8 weeks and re-instated after this period.  I would advise any person in receipt of mortgage interest supplement who is taking up temporary employment to discuss their individual circumstances with the officer in the Community Welfare Service administering their claim.  </p></reply>

Intreo Centres also support clients who have independently identified MOMENTUM through other channels. </p><p>  MOMENTUM programmes available to eligible Dun Laoghaire residents assist unemployed jobseekers to gain in-demand skills and to access work in sectors of the economy where there are job opportunities.  Eligible clients are supported to access to the most appropriate programme, taking account of their personal requirements and circumstances, including training needs, geographical location, etc.  An initial induction module on each programme provides an opportunity to reaffirm course suitability or exploration of alternative options, where appropriate.  Continued monitoring of the participation and progression of the learners throughout the programme is facilitated by an active case management approach and a sharing of information between SOLAS and my Department.</p><p>  It is not possible to establish the number of Jobseekers in the Dun Laoghaire Constituency who are currently on MOMENTUM programmes.

He is also paid an increase in respect of a qualified adult (his spouse) and an increase for a qualified child.  </p><p>  His spouse is also in receipt of a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance. She was employed as a polling clerk for one day last year. A person in receipt of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance is entitled to work in paid employment for up to 15 hours per week and any such income from employment is assessed as means. In this regard, a couple can have means of up to &euro;665 per week without affecting entitlement to a maximum rate of either a full-rate or half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment. Payment is reduced at a tapered rate (50%) where means are in excess of &euro;665 per week. Accordingly, the income form employment as a polling clerk did not affect the rate of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payable. </p><p>  When the spouse of a person in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is in employment, his or her earnings are assessed as means for the purposes of establishing the level of entitlement to the payment. Means are assessed by applying a &euro;20 earnings disregard per day worked (up to a maximum of &euro;60), with the remainder of earnings assessed at 60%. </p><p>  In the case in question, the spouse worked for one day as a polling clerk and earned &euro;350.00.  The means assessment was calculated as follows:</p><p>  &euro;350.00 - &euro;20 (disregard) = &euro;330.00 x 60% = &euro;198.00 weekly means. </p><p>  These means reduced the level of entitlement for the week in question by &euro;198 and an overpayment of this amount arose. In the case of the individual concerned, there was a previous overpayment of &euro;134.10, which accounted for a total overpayment position of &euro;332.10. </p><p>  Employment as a polling clerk is treated in the same manner as any other form of employment in relation to means testing.  There are currently no plans to make any changes to these arrangements.  It is considered that the current arrangements offer sufficient incentive for jobseekers and other means tested recipients including qualified adults to engage in employment, as earnings as assessed on a partial basis only and weekly or daily income disregards apply. </p></reply>

The rate of payment of BTWEA in the first year for a customer who pursues a self-employment option is equal to the full value of their previous jobseeker&rsquo;s payment to which they were in receipt of prior to taking up the Allowance.  Therefore, there is no particular advantage toa customer reverting to jobseekers payments during periods of slack business.  The value of the BTWEA reduces to 75% of the prior payment in the second year.  As indicated in my previous reply, it is likely that customers in receipt of BTWEA will be better off by the combination of the BTEWA payment and any income from their business venture, rather than reverting to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p></reply>

A statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme has never existed.  The level of employer and employee contributions is agreed and established in contract in the Trust Deeds and Rules of each scheme when a pension scheme is established. The imposition of such an obligation on employers has been considered on a number of occasions in recent years. The issue was last considered in the preparation of the measures included in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013. However, it was decided not to proceed with such a measure given the current economic circumstances, uncertainties as to the overall impact on such a measure and the potential for unintended consequences.<br/><br/>I am aware that many pension schemes are encountering funding difficulties at this time.<br/><br/>A number of legislative measures have been put in place to assist employers and trustees of pension schemes respond to these difficulties. I hope that these measures will be of assistance in resolving the funding difficulties in the Tara Mines pension scheme. It would not be appropriate for me to engage with or comment on developments relating to a particular pension scheme as these are a matter for the management of the company and the trustees of the pension scheme.  <font color="#FF0000"> </font></p></reply>

I am keeping this matter under close review. However, raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and could impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. Increasing housing supply and the reactivation of the construction activity is a key issue for Government and is critical to restoring stability to the rental market.<br/><br/>The Department is taking measures to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers who are in danger of becoming homeless are being addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the scheme. A notice reminding all staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated during 2014 and a further instruction recently issued in December 2014 to ensure that there is consistency throughout the country.  <br/><br/>The tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations is designed to protect families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation from becoming homelessness and payment in excess of the rent limits are being made for some 290 families in the Dublin region. The protocol will be shortly extended to Cork city and staff in the Department are engaging with Cork City Council and non-Government organisations in this regard. Staff outside the Dublin region are also increasing rent supplement payments as necessary and are actively engaging with the relevant local authority and various local organisations involved in homelessness.  <br/><br/>Where a person in receipt of rent supplement is at risk of losing their tenancy they should make contact with the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold in Dublin or to their local Community Welfare Service.<br/><br/>Rent supplement recipient numbers by county and information on expenditure since 2010 is provided in the attached tabular statements.

The relevant schemes are farm assist, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, state pension non-contributory and pre-retirement allowance.  The latter scheme was closed to new entrants from 2007.  These arrangements do not apply to other means tested schemes such as one-parent family payment and disability allowance.</p><p>  A person who is engaged in farming is eligible to apply for farm assist including farmers receiving a REPS/AEOS payment.  This scheme was established in 1999 to provide income support for low income farmers and replaced the support previously available known as &ldquo;smallholders&rdquo; unemployment assistance.  The Department operates a number of other social assistance schemes which provide for various contingencies, such as unemployment, disability, old age, widowhood and single parenthood.  As a result of being based on these diverse contingencies, the operation of these schemes necessarily varies in relation to the conditionality, eligibility criteria and the means test that apply.  It is considered that the current arrangements relating to the treatment of REPS/AEOS payments to farmers are appropriate given that a dedicated means-tested scheme is available for farmers generally.  Accordingly, there are currently no plans to introduce a disregard for monies received from agri-environment schemes in the means assessment for disability allowance or any scheme to which is does not currently apply.</p></reply>

On foot of this, payment of Rent Supplement was suspended with effect from 3rd of September 2014, pending a review of entitlement.  As part of the review, the Department contacted the landlord to ascertain if the matter regarding the non-payment of rent by the tenant had been resolved.  The landlord confirmed that he had a PRTB hearing date for either September or October, although he could not confirm the date.  As part of the review, the tenant was requested to authorise the Rent Supplement to be paid directly to the landlord.  The tenant consented to this request and the Rent Supplement for September and October 2014 issued directly to the landlord&rsquo;s bank account.  The tenancy ceased shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  </p><p>  The Government has no plans to change this policy, and I have not been presented with any plans from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to reduce the basic rate of the State pension.  In fact, the Government increased payments for certain pensioners by increasing the rate of the Living Alone Allowance in Budget 2015 to &euro;9.00.</p><p>  This increases the maximum personal rate of the State non-contributory pension for a qualified person living alone to &euro;228 per week, and the maximum rate for the contributory pension to &euro;239.30, when both the basic pension and the allowance are taken into account.  </p><p>  The most recent change in the core rate of State pensions was in Budget 2009, when the State pension contributory was increased by 3.1% to &euro;230.30, and the non-contributory pension by 3.3% to &euro;219.00.  Both of these are the maximum personal rates, and there are increases for dependant adults which attracted similar increases at that time. </p><p>  Core pension rates were not reduced in the period since then, despite significant pressures on Exchequer spending, and a period of significant deflation which has protected those increases in real terms from erosion by inflation.  This has had the effect of protecting older people from poverty, and all CSO figures show that those over 65 are significantly less likely to be at risk of poverty or deprivation than those aged under 65, whichever measure is used.</p><p>  The recovery has also allowed us some leeway to increase spending in targeted areas, which is why I was able to restore a partial Christmas bonus last month, benefitting over 575,000 pensioners and 1.23 million welfare recipients in total.</p><p>  I am aware of an options paper that was prepared by an official in the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform which considered the arguments for a reduction in a number of payment rates, including that of the State pension, and this may be the basis of the question asked by the Deputy.  However, that paper stated quite clearly that the views presented in the paper were those of the author alone and do not represent the official views of that Department or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am satisfied that this remains the case.</p></reply>

A number of both legislative and administrative changes have been made in recent years to assist employer and the trustees of pension schemes address the funding challenges facing such schemes. </p><p>  The most recent changes to pension legislation extended the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pension Act to include a portion of pensioner benefits.  Prior to this change, the trustees of a scheme could only consider the benefit of active and deferred scheme members in any restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act.  Any consideration of a restructure of pensioner benefits is limited to up to 10% of benefit where the annual pension is greater than &euro;12,000 and less than &euro;60,000.  Pension over &euro;60,000 can be reduced by up to 20%.  Pensions up to &euro;12,000 cannot be reduced.  The benefits of active and deferred members do not receive this level of protection under the Pensions Act.  </p><p>  The recent changes to pension legislation essentially provide for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme beneficiaries.  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries.</p><p>  These recent changes to the Pension Act are underpinned by additional measures which are being put in place by the Pensions Authority to assist pension schemes achieve a sustainable funding position.</p></reply>

In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.  As at December 2014 the average time taken to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing has reduced to 28.7 weeks and for a summary decision to 21.4 weeks.<br/><br/>The reduction in processing time reflects the significant resources which have been invested in the Social Welfare Appeals Office over the last number of years.<br/><br/>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant reduction in the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,480 at 12 January 2015.<br/><br/>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<br/><br/>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<br/><br/><b>Appeals Processing Times by Scheme 2014</b><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>SWAO<br /><br />(weeks)</th><th>Department of Social Protection<br /><br />(weeks)</th><th>Appellant<br /><br />(weeks)</th><th>Totals</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>8.2</td><td>8.9</td><td>-</td><td>17.1</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Pension</td><td>18.7</td><td>11.2</td><td>-</td><td>29.9</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td>8.8</td><td>19.3</td><td>0.4</td><td>28.6</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td>15.1</td><td>6.8</td><td>0.1</td><td>22.0</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>11.7</td><td>11.7</td><td>0.2</td><td>23.6</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>9.6</td><td>11.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>20.7</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>9.4</td><td>14.1</td><td>4.4</td><td>27.8</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td>13.0</td><td>37.1</td><td>-</td><td>50.1</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>9.3</td><td>11.9</td><td>0.2</td><td>21.4</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>13.1</td><td>18.1</td><td>0.4</td><td>31.7</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>12.2</td><td>8.7</td><td>-</td><td>20.9</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>9.6</td><td>18.1</td><td>-</td><td>27.8</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>9.4</td><td>17.4</td><td>0.1</td><td>27.0</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>9.8</td><td>28.0</td><td>0.5</td><td>38.3</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>14.3</td><td>18.6</td><td>0.1</td><td>33.0</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>16.2</td><td>7.6</td><td>-</td><td>23.8</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>12.4</td><td>17.6</td><td>0.7</td><td>30.7</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>12.8</td><td>13.8</td><td>0.1</td><td>26.8</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>13.8</td><td>29.4</td><td>0.3</td><td>43.5</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>12.0</td><td>35.1</td><td>0.4</td><td>47.5</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>13.3</td><td>14.4</td><td>-</td><td>27.7</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>10.4</td><td>23.8</td><td>-</td><td>34.2</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)</td><td>11.0</td><td>8.6</td><td>-</td><td>19.6</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)</td><td>11.5</td><td>10.1</td><td>-</td><td>21.7</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>12.6</td><td>16.4</td><td>0.2</td><td>29.1</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>11.0</td><td>13.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>24.3</td></tr><tr><td>JA/JB Fraud Control </td><td>12.1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>12.1</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>10.7</td><td>14.6</td><td>0.1</td><td>25.3</td></tr><tr><td>Pre Retirement Allowance</td><td>6.1</td><td>4.0</td><td>-</td><td>10.1</td></tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant</td><td>10.8</td><td>9.6</td><td>0.2</td><td>20.6</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance</td><td>9.3</td><td>11.5</td><td>0.2</td><td>21.0</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)</td><td>10.4</td><td>21.4</td><td>0.2</td><td>32.0</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-con)</td><td>10.5</td><td>17.5</td><td>-</td><td>28.0</td></tr><tr><td>Widows Parent Grant</td><td>15.1</td><td>7.1</td><td>-</td><td>22.2</td></tr><tr><td>All Appeals</td><td>10.5</td><td>13.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>24.2</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It provides valuable resourcing for service delivery undertaken by not-for-profit companies and cooperatives in communities around the country.  Some 2,800 people are supported in employment by the programme across approximately 400 not-for-profit companies and co-operatives.  Funding of &euro;46m has been provided for the programme in 2015 which will maintain the current level of activity.</p><p>  Service providers must operate community or social enterprises that are able to deliver tangible services and are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising.  The programme is not intended to represent full funding for any operation.  Rather, funding is provided on the basis of a contribution to the cost of full-time staffing positions to support the delivery of the service and can include management and non-management elements.</p><p>  Given the restrictions on resources, the Department has been unable to make an open call for new proposals to the programme for a number of years.  However, from time to time and as resources allow, the Department does process new applications received from organisations that have expressed an interest in and are considered eligible under the programme.  Any not-for-profit company wishing to express an interest to be considered for the programme can send an expression of interest and its proposals to the Department by email to cspinfo@welfare.ie.</p></reply>

To date my officials have had one formal meeting with the various parties mentioned above in connection with this issue and continue to engage with all relevant parties to try to progress the matter. </p><p>  I am not in a position to indicate when this review will be completed. </p><p>  My Department is aware of circumstances where companies have ceased trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process and where those employers may owe monies to their employees.  Such employees are not eligible for payments under the insolvency payments scheme.  At present we have information on approximately 200 such situations.  We have been informed of the value of the claims in 75% of cases and they range in value from &euro;52 to &euro;33,411.  However, the number and value of cases notified to us cannot be taken to be indicative of the total number.  Individuals in this situation may not have made contact with the Department, as they would be aware that eligibility for payment under the insolvency payments scheme only arises when a company has been formally wound-up.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-14a.214.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011400054#WRE02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 to 86, inclusive, 89, and 93 to 98, inclusive, together. <br/><br/>Table 1 contains details of the breakdown of JobBridge host organisations by number of interns.  <br/><br/>Table 2 contains details of the breakdown of JobBridge interns by age.  <br/><br/>Table 3 contains details of the breakdown of JobBridge interns by Government Department and Agency.  <br/><br/>Since the commencement of JobBridge in July 2011, 805 interns have been placed with the 5 host organisations with the highest number of interns, of whom 317 are currently on placement.  3 of those host organisations are in the public sector, 1 in the private sector and 1 in the community and voluntary sector.<br/><br/>At present, a total of 43 host organisations are excluded indefinitely from participation, a number of others are excluded for shorter periods of time.  The reasons for exclusion from participation in the scheme vary and include issues such as poor quality internships, that there is evidence of employment displacement, that the internship as operated did not reflect that which was advertised and that Standard Agreement was not completed as required.<br/><br/>Following the announcement of the Youth Developmental Internship, when the T&aacute;naiste invited expressions of interest from potential host organisations, the Department has undertaken a number of actions to develop and promote interest in the scheme. In addition to contacting a range of potential host organisations the Department has also contacted the Education and Training Board Ireland (ETBI) to develop a one week work preparation course.  It is envisaged that the first intake of participants will be in March/April 2015.<br/><br/>The Department, in the immediate future, will provide for quantitative evaluation of a number of programmes through econometric analysis of post-programme outcomes for participants and for control groups of non-participants.  The evaluation approach will be based on learning from a &ldquo;pathfinder&rdquo; evaluation of the Back to Education Allowance currently close to finalisation by ESRI, exploiting data from a longitudinal jobseekers&rsquo; database developed by the Department.  This project is establishing the extent to which the data, and the available evaluation techniques, are able to produce insights sufficient to support policy choices and the assessment of the costs and benefits of alternative approaches.  Building on the outcome of the pathfinder project, it is intended to launch structured, econometric, evaluation(s) of a number of further programmes, including JobBridge, in 2015.<br/><br/>Participation in JobBridge is voluntary therefore prospective interns are free to apply for internships which are of interest to them.  As such PEX is not a determining factor for participation and the data regarding PEX as requested by the question is not routinely recorded as part of the JobBridge process.<br/><br/>The Department receives employer supplied progression data at the end of each internship which outlines the reason for the completion of the internship.  This information will form part of the econometric evaluation examining progression rates for a number of activation programmes as outlined above.<br/><br/>In general the cooling off period applies to all host organisations as per the scheme guidelines.  In cases where the cooling off period is waived this is done on a case by case basis, and as such statistics are not maintained.<br/><br/>From July, 2011, some 65,686 internship positions have been advertised by host organisations, of which 29,387 internship have not been filled.<br/><br/><b>Table 1: Breakdown of JobBridge Host Organisations by number of interns (</b>As at 8 January, 2015)<table><tr><th>Number of Interns</th><th>Number of Host Organisations</th></tr><tr><td>1-4</td><td>14,703</td></tr><tr><td>5-9</td><td>764</td></tr><tr><td>10-20</td><td>239</td></tr><tr><td>21-50</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>51-100</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Over 100</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>15,843</td></tr></table><blockquote></blockquote><b>Table 2: Breakdown of JobBridge Interns by Government Department/Agency (</b>As at 8 January, 2015)<table><tr><th>Host Organisation</th><th>Total Interns</th></tr><tr><td>D/Agriculture Food and Marine</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>D/Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>D/Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>D/Defence</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>D/Education and Skills</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>D/Environment, Community and Local Government</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>D/Finance</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>D/Health</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>D/Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>D/Justice and Equality</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>D/Public Expenditure and Reform</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>D/Social Protection</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>D/Taoiseach</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>D/ Transport, Tourism and Sport</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Houses of the Oireachtas</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Attorney General</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Pensions Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Secretary General to the President</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue Commissioners</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Valuation Office</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Teagasc</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>486</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b>Table 3: Breakdown of JobBridge Interns by Age  (</b>As at 8 January, 2015)<table><tr><th>Age Range</th><th>Total Interns since Scheme Commenced</th></tr><tr><td>Under 25</td><td>10,125</td></tr><tr><td>25-34 years</td><td>15,614</td></tr><tr><td>35-44 years</td><td>6,408</td></tr><tr><td>45-54 years</td><td>3,312</td></tr><tr><td>Over 55 years</td><td>975</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>36,434</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Charter is an initiative of the Labour Market Council which was established by An T&aacute;naiste to help drive actions under the Government&rsquo;s programme of change as set out in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>and <i>Pathways to Work</i>.<br/><br/>33 companies have signed the Charter to date.  Companies who sign the Charter are agreeing to engage with the Department in relation to supporting a number of activities which will benefit unemployed people &ndash; particularly long-term and young unemployed people &ndash; find a route back into employment. There are three main areas of activities which a company may be involved in:<br/><br/>- Considering potential candidates from the live register as part of the recruitment process.  Companies who sign the Charter guarantee that at least 50% of candidates to be considered for interview will be taken from the live register;<br/><br/>- Providing training/work experience opportunities, and<br/><br/>- Providing employability supports including information sessions for jobseekers and advice/guidance in relation to job search, CV preparation and interview skills.<br/><br/>Given the early stage of rollout of the charter, data is not yet available in regard to its impact on employment of people from the live register.  Data will be collected and made available in Q2 2015.<br/><br/>The Charter is reflective of the ongoing work of my Department in building relationships with employers and is also a means of publicising the supports and services available from my Department which form the basis of that work and of raising employer awareness about initiatives, such as JobsPlus, JobBridge and the Youth Development Internship. <br/><br/>The ethos of the Charter is to build on the strong corporate social responsibility practices operating in Ireland through the involvement of business in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s jobseekers by contributing in terms of their organisations&rsquo; time and expertise.<br/><br/>I would very much welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s support in encouraging employers to sign the Charter which can be accessed on .</p></reply>

In this particular case however, the Judge considered that the decision makers did not have regard to certain specified matters relating to financial and material support in deciding the case and remitted the matter to be re-considered in the light of those issues.</p><p>  The fact that one parent is in receipt of rent supplement would not in itself preclude the other parent from being entitled to assistance towards his or her rent. In these situations, the circumstances of both parents are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined including matters relating to financial and material support in relation to their children.</p><p>  Persons seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy a decision maker that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from within their own resources. In addition, the decision maker must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant and that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-14a.263.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011400056#WRG00700"><p>Following the notification of the decision of the Clones Branch Office Manager to retire on 6February 2015 a review of the delivery of the Department&rsquo;s services in North County Monaghan was carried out.Over the last number of years the Department has developed a new integrated income support, employment and support service called &lsquo;Intreo&rsquo;, and has been transforming its nationwide network of Local Offices into &lsquo;Intreo Centres&rsquo;. The Intreo Centre is a one-stop shop for all income and employment support services where customers can access job-seeking advice, information on vacancies and income support services all in the one place. The local Intreo Centre provides expert help and advice on employment, training and personal development opportunities with a focus on customer needs to help them enter the workforce. Self-service kiosks are available to provide information and case officers offer advice and guidance on employment and training opportunities. The individualised supports which are available to jobseekers assist them in getting back to work and increasing their employability.    There are a number of key elements which make up the Intreo service including:</p><p>- Integrated reception providing a one-stop shop incorporating all strands of the Department&rsquo;s income support and employment services.</p><p>- Provision of information and access to income supports, including jobseekers' payments, back to work and back to education payments, one-parent family payments and community welfare services. Integrated decision-making process leading to quicker payment decisions.</p><p>- Intreo has introduced a new approach to engagement with people who are unemployed. It transforms the nature and level of engagement between employment services and people on the Live Register with the objective of helping people on the pathway back to employment. The aim is that the first day a client enters an Intreo Centre and engages with the service, that day is the start of the journey back to work.</p><p>  Currently these new Intreo services are not provided to our customers in County Monaghan and following the review mentioned above the Department has decided that these enhanced services can best be provided by utilising the capacity of Branch Offices in Monaghan Town, Castleblayney, and the Intreo Centre in Cavan Town.  The Department is confident that by adopting this approach we can better serve the needs of our customers by providing the broad range of Intreo services much sooner than would otherwise be the case.</p><p>  To ensure a smooth transition, and to minimise disruption to our customers, each customer has been assigned to the next closest DSP service in accordance with their geographic location. They have therefore been aligned with Branch Offices in Monaghan Town, Castleblayney, or the DSP Intreo Centre in Cavan. This re-configuration will provide customers with access to enhanced activation services and those attending Cavan Town will benefit immediately.  Customers attending the Monaghan Town Branch Office will also benefit from the proposed participation of that office in Intreo trials during 2015.</p><p>  Customers who reside more than 16 kilometres from their assigned Branch Office/Intreo Centre may avail of postal signing arrangement whereby they sign a postal declaration two months out of three and sign in the Branch/Intreo Office on the third month.  The Department is communicating in writing to each customer regarding the operational changes detailing their new DSP access point and signing arrangements.  Customers will be informed that there will be no changes to current payment arrangements.</p><p>  Department services such as Social Welfare Inspector, Designated Officer (former Community Welfare Officer) and Local Employment Services will not be affected by this change and will continue to be provided in Clones for customers and the general public as normal.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring our services meet customer needs in as efficient a manner as possible.</p></reply>

This would be necessary for the computation of the cost.

In addition to providing certainty, it also eases the administration burden on the homeowner by not having to revalue their houses each year.</p><p>  The regular revaluation periods ensure that the property register is maintained with accurate and up to date information to assist in evaluating the operation of LPT, as well as bringing newly built properties within the scope of LPT.  The Deputies may be aware that under the LPT legislation, where a property is not a &quot;relevant residential property&quot; on a valuation date (i.e. not liable to LPT), with certain exceptions, that property will not be a relevant residential property until the next valuation date. In the interests of equitable treatment of compliant LPT payers, it is important to have regular valuation dates so that newly built properties are brought into the LPT net. It also provides certainty to those homeowners as to when they will become liable to LPT.</p><p>  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid from 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2016, and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, including repairs or improvements made, during this period. I also committed not to amend the central national rate of LPT for the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  While I am very conscious of the concerns of homeowners over increasing property prices and the effects this will have on their LPT liabilities, particularly in urban areas, the next valuation date is not until 1 November 2016. In advance of that date, in conjunction with my officials, I will be examining the LPT and impacts on LPT liabilities due to increasing property prices.</p></reply>

This includes euromillions prizes of &euro;101.7m. Based on 2014 figures, assuming the tax only applies to the excess winnings over &euro;750,000, a tax of 5% on National Lottery winnings over &euro;750,000 would yield &euro;8,313,828.<br/><br/>The introduction of such a tax could have a significant detrimental impact on sales of National Lottery games and on the profits of Premier Lotteries Ireland as licensee. The introduction of such a tax was not referred to in the Licence competition and PLI bid for the licence on that basis.<br/><br/>Section 41 of the National Lottery Act 2013 provides that moneys paid into the Central Fund pursuant to section 44 shall be applied for the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time:<br/><br/>(a) sport and recreation;<br/><br/>(b) national culture and heritage (including the Irish language);<br/><br/>(c) the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act 2003);<br/><br/>(d) health of the community;<br/><br/>(e) youth, welfare and amenities;<br/><br/>(f) natural environment;<br/><br/>(g) such other objectives (if any) as the Government may determine from time to time.<br/><br/>A taxation on winnings could be expected to have a behavioural effect on participation and reduce the surplus available for these purposes.  National Lottery winnings are currently exempted from Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Capital Acquisitions Tax.  I do not propose at this time to introduce a tax such as is suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

At the household level, lower energy prices are likely to lead to an increase in real disposable incomes, which can be used to reduce indebtedness or increase consumption on other goods and services.</p><p>  In terms of quantifying the impact, a reasonable rule of thumb is that, everything else being equal, each sustained &euro;10 per barrel reduction in the price of oil boosts the level of real GDP by somewhere in the region 0.1 - 0.2 percentage points.</p><p>  The decline in oil prices will also reduce inflation.  At the level of the euro area, the latest figures show that inflation moved into negative territory in December for the first time since 2009.  Falling oil prices will further weigh on inflation in the short-term.  If expectations of falling prices were to become entrenched, the negative impact on the euro area economy could potentially be severe.</p></reply>

A Revenue officer has reasonable grounds for believing that a return of income is incorrect due to its having been completed in a fraudulent or negligent manner,<br/><br/>2. A Return has not been filed,<br/><br/>3. A Revenue officer is not satisfied with the sufficiency of a return, having regard to any information  received in that regard,<br/><br/>4. A Revenue officer has reasonable grounds for believing that a return does not contain a full and true disclosure of all material facts, or<br/><br/>5. A case involves a tax avoidance transaction to which the provisions of section 811 or section 811C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 apply.<br/><br/>A taxpayer who is aggrieved by any assessment made or amended by a Revenue officer outside the 4 year time limit has a right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners.<br/><br/>The general 4 year time limit within which Revenue may ordinarily examine returns made by compliant taxpayers is matched by a 4 year time limit within which taxpayers may claim a repayment of tax.  This scheme of 4 year time limits was designed to achieve the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for compliant taxpayers, including equality of treatment between PAYE and self-employed taxpayers, while at the same time providing the necessary protection for the Exchequer both from exposure to repayment claims for historic periods and providing the Revenue Commissioners with the authority to pursue liabilities for these historic periods where a taxpayer had not filed a tax return, had filed an incorrect return or had engaged in tax avoidance transactions which could be challenged under the general anti-avoidance rule.</p></reply>

The table illustrates the effect of the proposal in the case of a single individual assessed under the PAYE system. As it is assumed in costing the proposal that all current tax credits and allowances are abolished, this effect would be amplified and extended in the case of married one earner couples. Furthermore, the very large benefits accruing to the better off under this proposal would undermine the progressivity that is inherent in the current income tax system.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is committed to reducing the marginal tax rate on low and middle-income earners, over a series of budgets, in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.</p></reply>

Brent crude oil has fallen by nearly 50 per cent in euro terms (by over 55 per cent in US dollar terms) since June 2014. In this context, core inflation which excludes energy and unprocessed food prices has averaged 0.8 per cent in the first eleven months of 2014.</p><p>  In terms of the impact, a distinction must be drawn between short and medium-term effects. In the short-term, low inflation or even falling prices helps protect real incomes and boost competitiveness. However, a prolonged period of low inflation or falling prices is problematic for a number of reasons. Firstly, the expectation of lower price levels in the future leads households and firms to postpone personal consumption and investment, therefore reducing aggregate demand. Secondly, it pushes up the real interest rate, which increases the real cost of borrowing. Thirdly, low inflation or deflation increases the real burden of debt.</p><p>  In terms of addressing the risk of low inflation, the appropriate approach is to ensure solid economic growth. This is what the Government is doing by putting the public finances on a stable path and ensuring a banking sector capable of providing credit to support the real economy. It is also important to note that deflationary trends were highlighted as an economic risk in Budget 2015 and continue to be monitored in this regard.</p></reply>

These charges shall be appropriate and in line with the payment service provider's actual costs. <br/><br/>All charges applicable must be provided before a user uses a payment service.<br/><br/>Providers must give 2 months notice to users of any proposed changes to framework contracts  and if the user is not happy with the changes proposed they can object and/or immediately terminate the contract for free.<br/><br/>The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 contains a number of provisions relating to charges which regulated entities including credit institutions must comply with, except when providing payment service and/or issuing electronic money. Under the Code regulated entities must:<br/><br/>- make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer.<br/><br/>- provide consumers with a breakdown of all charges, including third party charges prior to providing a product or service to the consumer.  Where such charges cannot be ascertained in advance, notify the consumer that such charges will be levied as part of the transaction.<br/><br/>- display a schedule of fees and charges in public offices, in a manner that is easily accessible to consumers. If the regulated entity has a website, its schedule of fees and charges must also be made available on the website.<br/><br/>- notify affected consumers of increases in charges, specifying the new charge and the old charge, or the introduction of any new charge, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect.<br/><br/>- must, where charges are accumulated and applied periodically to accounts consumers, and amount to &euro;10 or more notify the consumer at least 10 business days in advance of the deduction of the charges and give each consumer a breakdown of such charges.<br/><br/>In relation to an account held by a consumer who then relocates to another jurisdiction, there are numerous scenarios, including whether the relocation is temporary or permanent and whether the consumer wishes to maintain their account or close it etc. and therefore it is difficult to be definitive about a bank's obligations.  If a customer is moving abroad, he/she should clarify these matters with their bank.<br/><br/>With regard to the Deputy's question regarding maintenance fees and dormant accounts,  it is not entirely clear to what type of account the Deputy refers, that is, a bank account that is currently not actively being used by the customer or a dormant account within the meaning of the Dormants Accounts Act 2001.  Under the Act,  a bank account is only considered a dormant account when it is transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund after laying dormant for 15 years. <br/><br/>The NTMA informed me that it is not aware that any requests for maintenance fees from the banks have been processed by the NTMA since the establishment of the Dormant Accounts Fund. The Central Bank also informed me that it was not aware of any maintenance fees being applied to dormant accounts. <br/><br/>If the account is not a dormant account but has merely not been used for a period, the normal rules under the Payment Services Regulationsand Consumer Protection apply.</p></reply>

The reforms introduced by the 'two-pack' and 'six-pack' were also underpinned by the 2012 Stability Treaty.</p><p>  It is also important to stress that considerable progress has been made towards a pan-European Banking Union with considerable progress made during Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union   while a substantial firewall (the European Stability Mechanism) has been created.  The existence of a banking union will help participating Member States, including Ireland, avoid and where necessary respond more efficiently to any future economic shocks. </p><p>  So we are now in a much better place and I would point out that Ireland has fully participated in the European Semester since last year, having exited the EU/IMF programme of financial assistance at the end of 2013.  From an Irish perspective, we are doing our bit to ensure stability in the euro area our public finances have been put on a more stable footing and we are reducing macroeconomic imbalances.  This is positive from a euro area perspective but also from an Irish perspective.</p><p>  Finally, it is worth noting that a further discussion on the future of the euro area economic and fiscal framework will be included in the forthcoming 'Four Presidents' report.</p></reply>

This will have implications for economic activity in Ireland in real and nominal terms.</p><p>  On the real side, it should be recalled that Ireland is a net energy importer and as such any unanticipated fall in oil prices will havea positive impact in the short term.  Lower energy prices reduce firms' input costs, thus improving profitability and  competitiveness.  At the household level, lower energy prices are likely to lead to an increase in real disposable incomes, which can be used to reduce indebtedness or increase consumption.  As a result, there is some upside potential to real domestic demand forecasts as announced in the Budget.</p><p>  There is generally a lag between movements in prices at wholesale and retail level given that suppliers have entered into forward contracts.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is no price control on liquid fuel products in Ireland.  All persons selling certain fuel products are legally required to specifiy on their premises the price per litre being charged to the consumer for these commodities.  Consumers are strongly encouraged to inform themselves of the different price offerings in their localities so as to enable them to proactively seek out the best value when purchasing fuel products.</p></reply>

The report can be found at the following website address - <br/><br/>For background Ireland's EIB Task Force's project list was the result of coordination between my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and the Departments with responsibility for public expenditure in the investment sectors specified in the Task Force's Terms of Reference. We have relied on Department's and agencies with direct policy responsibility as the source of all the projects that have been included in Ireland's input to the EU wide project list. <br/><br/>The Irish project list is part of an EU wide request from the Task Force to gauge the level of available projects in the period 2015-2017 should investment resources be found.  The project list is only a cross section of available projects that could commence between 2015 and 2017. The list does not involve prioritisation and does not bestow any special status on the projects themselves. <br/><br/>In the case of public capital expenditure, it is still a matter for the Department's concerned to advance those projects in accordance with the Capital programme and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. As of now, there is no extra funding available beyond the allocations agreed at Budget time and published in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015-2017. It is also important to acknowledge that the current rules of the Stability and Growth Pact mean that even if additional resources were to become available whether they could be used for additional expenditure would depend on the impact of that expenditure on our expenditure limits and the GGB, while how they could be used would depend on competing expenditure priorities.</p></reply>

However, in the case of a PIA or DSA proposal, the relevant creditors have the opportunity to consider and, where necessary, vote on the proposal made by the debtor.  The precise terms of any PIA or DSA, as proposed by a debtor and agreed by creditors, is a matter for the respective parties, having regard to the circumstances of any individual case. </li><li>Where a protective certificate issues, creditors affected by it are prevented by law from taking any step to secure or recover payment, including initiation or prosecution of legal proceedings.  Where a proposal is accepted by creditors these protections extend for the duration of the arrangement.</li><li>I understand from the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) that both the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Development Association, as credit union representative bodies, have been very engaged in working with the ISI on developing protocols covering standard terms for DSA and PIA arrangements. </li><li>However, both from a regulatory and supervisory point of view, it is the money of the saving members of credit unions that is ultimately lent to borrowing members, and credit unions must take appropriate steps to protect these funds.

This package is designed to help put the Greek economy on a path to sustainable growth and its domestic finances on a sound footing. This package was agreed in the context of the statement by Euro Area Heads of State or Government that the scale of the Greek problem is so large that it requires special attention.  <br/><br/>One of the measures agreed in November 2012, the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) measure, asks Member States to pass on, to Greece's segregated account, an amount equivalent to the income on the SMP portfolio accruing to their national central bank as from budget year 2013.  Member States under a full financial assistance programme, such as Ireland at that time, are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance. <br/><br/>It is important to note that the agreed concessions are specific to Greece and were accompanied by significant additional conditionality, and must be seen in the context of the very significant debt restructuring that has taken place under the Greek programme.<br/><br/>Section 2 of the Central Bank Act 2014 (No. 9 of 2014) provides for Ireland's payments under this measure. <br/><br/>Ireland's needs, as a country that has successfully exited a programme, are very different to those of Greece.  We have now returned to the international capital markets and our bond yields have fallen to historically low levels. We continue to seek ways to further reduce the interest burden, as demonstrated by our recent early repayment of some &euro;9 billion to the IMF. However,  I do not see the SMP measure agreed for Greece as appropriate in our case.</p></reply>

The main deductible expenses are:<br/><br/>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;<br/><br/>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;<br/><br/>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;<br/><br/>- the interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and <br/><br/>- payment of local authority rates. <br/><br/>In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.<br/><br/>The effect of the deduction of allowable expenses from gross rent means that the amount of taxable rental income will often be substantially lower than the gross rent, and could, depending on individual circumstances, be nil.<br/><br/>I have no plans at the moment to change the tax treatment of rental income for tax purposes, however, as a matter of course all such taxation measures and reliefs are considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p></reply>

I understand that there is the very small number of large claims where the maximum ICF payment of &euro;825,000 will apply.  </p><p>  In summary, the Liquidator has advised that settlements can only be paid out after all of the company's liabilities are quantified.  This process may take a number of years.  However, the Accountant of the High Court is in the process of agreeing procedures for the advance payment of 65% in respect of all claims that are eligible for payment from the ICF and he is hoping to apply to the President of the High Court in the coming months in respect of the first batch of 300 claims.</p><p>  The Accountant of the Courts of Justice can only deal with claims which are submitted by the Liquidator, so the advice to all claimants continues to be that they should contact the Liquidator of Setanta.</p></reply>

To qualify for the scheme, an applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate.<br/><br/>To be eligible for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions outlined in Regulation 3 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 353 of 1994) which provides that a person shall be assessed by reference to any one or more of the following medical criteria:<ol type="1"><li>persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</li><li>persons wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</li><li>persons without both hands or without both arms;</li><li>persons without one or both legs;</li><li>persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</li><li>persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</li></ol>The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria required to receive a Primary Medical Certificate.

In the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the person in question lodged a claim for full exemption but was advised that he did not meet the conditions for exemption as he is employed on a full-time basis.<br/><br/>The person subsequently lodged a claim for relief under Section 15A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended). This particular relief takes the form of a reduction in the chargeable value of a property that has been adapted to make it more suitable for occupation by a disabled person.  It is important to note that the chargeable value is not reduced by the actual cost of the adaptation work but, instead, is reduced by the amount (if any) by which the chargeable value has increased as a result of the adaptation work, i.e. the amount of the chargeable value that is directly attributable to the adaptation work.  Even relatively substantial adaptations, such as the construction of additional rooms, may not have the effect of moving a property into a higher valuation band given that valuation bands cover a span of &euro;50,000.  This means that, for many properties, there might not be any net effect for LPT purposes as a result of adaptation work.<br/><br/>In this case, the person valued his property at &euro;200,000 at 1 May 3013, putting the property in the valuation band of &euro;150,001 to &euro;200,000. This property would have required a reduction in its chargeable value of at least &euro;50,000 to move into the next lower valuation band of &euro;100,001 to &euro;150,000. As the person spent &euro;50,000 on adaptation work, the chargeable value of the property would have increased by less than this amount. In any event, there is an upper limit on the allowable reduction in a property's chargeable value of the lower of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work and the maximum local authority grant that would have been payable (if the person had availed of such a grant) when the adaptation work was carried out. The maximum local authority grant that would have been payable in this case would have been &euro;20,320 or &euro;12,700 (if the property was less than 12 months old at the time).  Regardless of which of these limits would have applied, neither would be sufficient for the property to move into the lower valuation band of &euro;150,001 to &euro;200,000. <br/><br/>In this case, the adaptation work that was carried out does not have the effect of moving the property into a lower valuation band with the result that there is no change in the amount of LPT payable.</p></reply>

Our most recent Budgets forecasts indicate future compliance with the fiscal rules without the inclusion of aggregate tax increases or nominal expenditure cuts.</p></reply>

The introduction of the ESM's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument (DRI), has been discussed on a number of occasions at those meetings. </p><p>  On 8 December 2014, the ESM Board of Governors approved the creation of the DRI in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM.   The operational framework for the DRI, approved on the same date, includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument. The guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.  </p><p>  However, unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.  Investors are now willing to support Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.</p><p>  My overall objective in relation to the State's investment in the banks is to maximise the return to the Irish taxpayer over time. In line with this objective my Department is working with AIB, the institution where &euro;20.8 billion has been invested, on reconfiguring the capital structure.  I have also appointed Goldman Sachs International to provide financial advice. The focus will be on ensuring that the best decisions are made regarding potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time. While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer. </p><p>  All options remain on the table and it is too early to specify what steps will be taken next or indeed to put a timeline on decisions.</p></reply>

This plan involves a Pilot Project that would see the channelling of some of An Post services through credit unions and also looks at the prospect of An Post providing some credit union services.</p><p>  I am always open to considering proposals in relation to credit unions, particularly those that would see the development of the credit union business model and an increase in income for the sector. Having read this proposal I believe there is some merit in it. However, it must be stressed that the proposal is at a very early stage of development and would require additional work, as identified in the paper by the proposers, before it can be progressed further. </p><p>  While officials from my Department met with one of the proposers of this plan on the 29 August 2014 to discuss its merits, such a proposal would require agreement from all stakeholders before a pilot project could be rolled out. A further meeting is scheduled with the proposer in the coming weeks to further discuss the matter.</p><p>  The proposal was also forwarded to the Central Bank, the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo). I have been informed by the Central Bank  that they met with credit union representatives involved in the proposal in October 2014 and have provided feedback on the proposal. The feedback covered matters for consideration in further developing the proposal, including areas of the financial services legislation that apply to credit unions, such as requirements whereby individual credit unions can only provide services to their members rather than to the general public. The Central Bank have also indicated that they are available for further meetings with the relevant parties as appropriate.  </p><p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is responsible for the regulation of credit unions and as such, any proposal in relation to credit unions would be subject to regulatory approval by the Regulator.</p></reply>

The Budget 2014 forecast assumed that prepayments in 2014 of 2015 LPT liabilities would be similar to the significant pre-payments for 2014 liabilities of c. &euro;75 million that were made in November and December 2013. However, there has been a significant behavioural change with a shift towards phased payments for 2015 LPT and pre-payments received in 2014 for 2015 are some &euro;35 million lower than expected.  In addition, fourteen of the thirty-one local authorities reduced the LPT rate that will apply for 2015, which has also impacted on the pre-payments received.  Furthermore, following a review carried out by the Revenue Commissioners on payment methods and patterns, the Commissioners extended the payment deadline of the 1st of January 2015 to 7 January to take account of the holiday period and to avoid property owners having to pay their LPT before Christmas.</p><p>  Finally, the target for 2014 LPT included an indicative estimate of additional Household Charge monies to be collected by Revenue.  I am advised that, over the course of the year, as Revenue worked these cases, it became clear that a significant number of properties were exempt or not liable for Household Charge and so additional payments did not arise for these properties.</p></reply>

The Bank stated it will sell a minimum of these securities in accordance with the following schedule: to end 2014 (&euro;0.5 billion), 2015-2018 (&euro;0.5 billion per annum), 2019-2023 (&euro;1 billion per annum), and 2024 on (&euro;2 billion per annum until all bonds are sold). As part of these minimum sales, the Bank sold &euro;350 million of the 5.4% Irish 2025 Government Bond by end December 2013.  There were no sales, purchases or transfers of FRNs in the year  2013.<br/><br/>I have been advised by the NTMA that total cash interest payable on the floating rate bonds in 2013 was &euro;638 million and total cash interest payable in 2014  was &euro;755 million.  The increase in interest payable in 2014 compared to 2013 largely reflects the fact that a full year's interest was payable in 2014.<br/><br/>As per its 2013 Annual Report the CBI sold &euro;350 million of its holdings of this bond in 2013. However, as the CBI's holdings of this bond during 2014 are not known, it is not possible to state the level of interest the CBI received on its holdings in 2014.<br/><br/>The next Central Bank of Ireland annual report will contain the updated overview of their holdings of these bonds as at YE2014 and is expected to be published in April 2015.</p></reply>

As part of that role my Department is currently considering options for advancing the objective of grade restructuring as one of a number of actions to strengthen Human Resource Strategy and resourcing policies. In this regard, Action 16 of the recent Civil Service Renewal Plan also provides for the redesign of organisational and grade structures in order to simplify them so that all roles and responsibilities are clear. It is also aimed at improving decision making by making sure that grade level never limits opportunities to make decisions, innovate or meet objectives. Implementation of this provision will take place during the term of the Renewal Plan and will be subject to discussions with Staff representatives.As mentioned above, commitments such as those referred to in the Deputy's question apply to the Civil Service as a whole and are implemented on a service-wide basis, rather than individually decided at the level of each individual Government Department and Office. It should be noted, however, that within the parameters of overall policy the management of the resources in a particular Department is a matter for the management of that Department. It has been a particular priority of the Management Board of my Department to ensure that the human resources of the Department are used in an effective and efficient way to support the achievement of Government objectives. The Deputy might be interested in reviewing the Annual Report of the Department for 2013, which summarises the significant achievements of its workforce. This is available on the Department s website.</p></reply>

Failure to provide this compliance certificate will result in payment not being made by the contracting authority. If a main contractor provides a certificate of compliance that is subsequently found to be untrue or partly untrue the contracting authority has the right to deduct the money relating to the work or part of the work covered by the certificate from any sums due to the main contractor. This money can be withheld until the pay and conditions of employment issue is made right. The ultimate sanction if a main contractor continues to be non-compliant is for the main contract to be terminated.</p><p>  The public works contracts also oblige a contractor to maintain records of pay, timesheets and any deductions made on behalf of all those employed on the site.  It requires a contractor to ensure that all deductions from payments to workers required by law are paid on to the relevant authorities/bodies.  These records are subject to inspection by representatives of the contracting authority as required. </p><p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract and the administration of the contract once awarded is a matter for each contracting authority.</p><p>  Whilst non-compliance with clause 5.3 carries the contractual remedy of non-payment or the deduction of sums that are legally due to employees or State authorities, contracting authorities should also report such matters to the relevant enforcement authorities. </p><p>  Enforcement of employment law and health and safety are matters for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The National Employment Rights Authority has the necessary powers to compel employers to provide the documentary evidence to establish whether they may have breached employment law and the Health and Safety Authority has similar powers to deal with breaches of health and safety legislation.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that Ministerial responsibility for the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland will be transferred to the Minister for Justice and Equality in 2015, in advance of the establishment of the proposed new body.</blockquote>The associated savings for each of the measures, derived from a reduction in the number of public servants and from other administrative savings, is set out in Appendix 3 of the aforementioned published Report.</p></reply>

The Decision, building on the earlier 2011 Decision, required my Department to prepare Guidelines on a new process to be agreed by Government. <br/><br/>The Guidelines were approved by Government in November 2014 and seek to provide good practice rules around the implementation of the Decision, which has at its core three key principles:<br/><br/>- promote wider access to opportunities on State Boards;<br/><br/>- put in place detailed and comprehensive criteria for those roles; and<br/><br/>- introduce transparent and rigorous assessment of candidates against these criteria.<br/><br/>The Guidelines clarify which positions on Boards they apply to and change the process around Ministerial appointments of individuals to State Boards. <br/><br/>The new arrangements provide for a robust selection system operated independently by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) with selection being based on objective criteria. The new arrangements will ensure that candidates recommended for appointment have the skills and competencies required to carry out their duties on a State board.  <br/><br/>Under the new system for appointments to State Boards, the specific requirements identified for board roles will be published as well as information illustrating the knowledge, skills, experience and expertise possessed by appointees conforming to those requirements. <br/><br/>Applications are welcome from people who believe they have the relevant skills and experience to join a State Board, barring any disqualifications that may apply under legislative provision. Persons interested in serving on a board should apply via the State Boards portal run by PAS at .</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money for public funds. It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, location, organisational size, and reputation, and there are legal remedies which may be sought against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  Circular 10/14 issued earlier this year by my Department is aimed at further opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is as easy and low cost as possible.  This guidance set out positive measures that contracting authorities and the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) are taking to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises as well as highlighting practices that are to be avoided because they can hinder smaller businesses in competing for public contracts.</p><p>  In relation to the question as to whether firms seeking to secure State contracts for services such as the cleaning of Garda stations will need the ISO9000 quality standard (or equivalent) in the future; there are no plans at this time to make this mandatory. </p><p>  The OGP will continue to work with suppliers to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

No. 124 of 2014) set out the provisions of the new Public Service Sick Leave Scheme.</p>  <p>  Regulation 10 of the Sick Leave Regulations provides that an individual's sick leave record will be reviewed over a 4-year period in order to determine how much paid sick leave they have access to.  Reviewing records over a period of 4 years is generally considered to be a more flexible way of providing support to employees during periods of illness. The alternative, providing more limited access to sick pay over a shorter time frame, is often more restrictive.</p>  <p>  The retention of a 4 year look back was agreed by the Labour Court and reflects the practice that previously existed in the majority of the Public Service.  The rationale for maintaining this provision was to ensure that individuals' sick leave records were not completely cleared on day one of the new Sick Leave Scheme.  This would have undermined a fundamental purpose of the new Sick Leave Scheme, which is to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave, by allowing individuals who had exhausted their access to paid sick leave under previous sick leave arrangements to have access to the full allowance of paid sick leave under the new Scheme.</p>  <p>  Regulations 19 and 20 provide additional access to paid sick leave for pregnancy related illness and were designed to comply with the European Court of Justice ruling in North Western Health Board v McKenna (C-191/03).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in the McKenna case, the Court considered that it was not discriminatory for pregnancy related absences to be offset against the maximum number of days' paid sick leave to which a female employee is entitled.  The Court also confirmed, however, that although it was not discriminatory to record the number of pregnancy-related sick leave days, a woman should still have access to the minimum payment that she would have received if she had not suffered a pregnancy-related illness.</p>  <p>  In accordance with this, Regulation 20 provides that any pregnancy-related absence for which a female employee has been paid at the half rate of pay will not count towards her paid sick leave limits.  In addition, Regulation 19 provides that a female employee who suffers from a pregnancy related illness will never receive less than the half rate of pay.</p>  <p>  A further arrangement was recently introduced, in line with advice from the Attorney General's Office, to ensure that women who did not previously have access to sick leave at half pay (e.g. teachers), do not exhaust their access to paid sick leave because of pregnancy related illness.</p></reply>

No. 124 of 2014) set out the provisions of the new Public Service Sick Leave Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Sick Leave Regulations provides that an individual's sick leave record will be reviewed over a 4-year period in order to determine how much paid sick leave they will have access to.  Reviewing records over a period of 4 years is generally considered to be a more flexible way of providing support to employees during periods of illness. The alternative,  providing more limited access to sick pay in a shorter time frame, is often more restrictive.</p>  <p>  The retention of the 4 year look back was agreed by the Labour Court and reflects the practice that previously existed in the majority of the Public Service.  The rationale for maintaining this provision was to ensure that individuals' sick leave records were not completely cleared on day one of the new Sick Leave Scheme.  This would have undermined a fundamental purpose of the new Sick Leave Scheme, which is to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave, by allowing individuals who had exhausted their access to paid sick leave under previous sick leave arrangements to have access to the full allowance of paid sick leave under the new Scheme.</p>  <p>  Regulations 19 and 20 provide additional access to paid sick leave for pregnancy related illness and were designed to comply with the European Court of Justice ruling in North Western Health Board v McKenna (C-191/03).</p>  <p>  In the McKenna case, the Court considered that it was not discriminatory for pregnancy related absences to be offset against the maximum number of days' paid sick leave to which a female employee is entitled. The Court also confirmed, however, that although it was not discriminatory to record the number of pregnancy related sick leave days, a woman should still have access to the minimum payment that she would have received if she had not suffered a pregnancy related illness.</p>  <p>  In accordance with this, Regulation 20 provides that any pregnancy related absence for which a female employee has been paid at the half rate of pay will not count towards her paid sick leave limits.  In addition, Regulation 19 provides that a female employee who suffers from a pregnancy related illness will never receive less than the half rate of pay.</p>  <p>  A further arrangement was recently introduced, in line with advice from the Attorney General's Office, to ensure that women who did not previously have access to sick leave at half pay (e.g. teachers), do not exhaust their access to paid sick leave because of pregnancy related illness.</p>  <p>  I have committed to undertake a formal review of the new Sick Leave Scheme after a full year of its operation to identify and changes that will enhance the operation of the Scheme.  I will consider all issues raised in the course of the year as part of that review.</p></reply>

Having regard to the implementation of the Gaeltacht Act 2012, Departments will be asked to pay particular attention to posts that are located in, or that are serving, Gaeltacht areas.  This process will be central to ensuring that future recruitment and interdepartmental promotion competitions run by PAS make sufficient provision for appointments to posts requiring functional bilinguals.  In the case of Departmental recruitment and promotion competitions, an assessment will be made of the requirement for functional bilinguals and, where necessary and appropriate, a sub-panel of functional bilinguals will be put in place.<br/><br/>The new arrangements replace the scheme of bonus marks for Irish, introduced nearly 40 years ago following the abolition of compulsory Irish for entry to the civil service.<b></b>Under the new arrangements, where a post in a Government Departments is identified as requiring proficiency in Irish, the intention is that it should be filled by a functional bilingual.<br/><br/>The new arrangements are part of the Executive Officer (EO) recruitment competition for which applications closed on 8 January 2015.  The new arrangements have also been incorporated into the ongoing Clerical Officer (CO) recruitment competition.  Stage 2 of the CO process is nearing completion.  Those who expressed a preference to be tested in Irish will now move on to oral and written tests which will test their abilities in the Irish language.<br/><br/>It is intended that a sub-panel of Irish language functional bilinguals comprising up to 6% of the overall panel size, will be created in both competitions subject to a sufficient number of candidates meeting the required standard.<br/><br/>The operation of the new arrangements in these competitions will be reviewed and will be revised as necessary in the context of experience and progress in achieving the Government's objectives.</p></reply>

According to assessments made by the European Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost the EU's GDP by 0.5% per annum, resulting in 400,000 additional jobs across the EU.  Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 118,000 people employed in 585 US companies here.  The total level of trade (imports and exports) between Ireland and the US in 2012 was &euro;55 billion.  The US is Ireland biggest merchandise export market.  The most recent data from the CSO shows that Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to the US increased by 40% in 2012.  Notwithstanding the present high level of trade enormous benefits could be derived from a comprehensive and ambitious TTIP.<br/><br/>My Department has commissioned a study on the potential impact of the TTIP for Ireland.  This study is intended to assist in guiding the Irish position in the negotiations.  The study is expected to be finalised in January 2015 and published in early 2015.<br/><br/>The initial findings by Copenhagen Economics show that the benefit to Ireland would be more than double the EU average, with 1.1% added to GDP.  Other preliminary findings include increased exports (2.7%), increases in real wages (1.4%) and investment (1.6%).  Opportunities are expected mainly in manufacturing &ndash; pharmaceutical and chemical industry, electrical machinery and other advanced machinery; services &ndash; insurance and ICT and Agriculture and processed foods.<br/><br/>A total of seven rounds of negotiations in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have taken place to date, the most recent during the week beginning 29 September last year in the US.  A summary of each of the Rounds is included in the reply to Question No 179 [48982/14] of 18 December 2015.<br/><br/>The next round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in Brussels during the week of 2 February 2015.<br/><br/>On 7 January, 2015, the EU Commission published a number of documents, all of which can be found at .<br/><br/>Included in the published documents are some of the EU&rsquo;s proposals for legal text in the TTIP that have been tabled for discussion with the US.  The areas covered by the texts published are competition, food safety and animal and plant health, customs issues, technical barriers to trade, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and government-to-government dispute settlement.  The EU Commission also published EU position papers explaining the EU's approach in the areas of engineering, vehicles, and sustainable development.  This brings to 15 the total number of published EU position papers on TTIP.  In addition, the EU Commission has published readers guides to the documents it has made available explaining what each text means, a glossary of terms and acronyms, and a series of factsheets that set out in plain language what is at stake in each chapter of TTIP and what the EU's aims are in each area.  I very much welcome the openness and transparency which will help to demystify the negotiations.<br/><br/>The EU Commission published its report on the results of the public consultation on investor protection on 13 January, 2015.  The Report, along with explanatory material, can be found at .</p></reply>

The price of fuel is dictated by global factors and reflects global market price (traded in dollars), Euro/Dollar fluctuations, refining costs, transportation costs, other operating costs, prevailing Excise Duty and VAT.  The National Consumer Agency, now part of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, carried out a survey in 2008 in relation to the underlying reasons why pump prices for petrol and diesel were appearing not to fall in line with the drop in the wholesale price of oil.  The related Report&rsquo;s overall finding was that, at national level, price changes for refined petroleum products are being passed on to Irish consumers in a relatively timely fashion.  The report noted in particular, that the prices that Irish retailers charge for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  The refinery price for oil products varies with demand and does not always move in line with crude oil prices.  There is a time lag between movements in crude prices and refined prices.<br/><br/>The former Agency&rsquo;s report also found that, in the main, as well as price changes for refined petroleum products being passed on to consumers in a relatively timely fashion, that profits of oil companies involved in the downstream supply of refined oil product supplies in Ireland were relatively modest and that many fuel retailers were becoming more and more dependent on non-fuel retail offerings to sustain revenue and margin opportunities.  The Agency's report did highlight the importance of the availability of price information in terms of empowering consumers to achieve the best value for money when purchasing liquid fuel products.<br/><br/>Many international studies have identified that petrol and diesel prices tend to rise faster than they decline, and that this is likely due to a time lag between when the retailers learn that wholesale prices will be changing and when consumers learn this and begin to more actively shop around.<br/><br/>The Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order 1997 (S.I. No 178 of 1997) requires all persons selling certain fuel products to specify by way of a public notice on their premises the price per litre being charged to the consumer for these commodities.  Accordingly, I would strongly encourage consumers to inform themselves of the different price offerings in their localities so as to enable them to proactively seek out the best value when purchasing fuel products.<br/><br/>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State and has a statutory role in monitoring compliance with this law and ensuring that petrol and diesel prices are accurately and accessibly displayed.  As the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission can investigate anti-competitive practices on its own initiative or on foot of complaints received, any evidence (past or present) of anticompetitive arrangements in the wholesale and retail market for petrol, diesel and home heating oil should be brought to the attention of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission .</p></reply>

This new framework proposes a mechanism whereby, in future, at the request, separately or jointly from organisations substantially representative of employers and/or of workers, the Labour Court can initiate a review of the pay and pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and, if it deems it appropriate, make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter, who in turn, if satisfied that the process provided in the new legislation for the Labour Court to follow has been complied with, he/she shall make the Order.  Such an Order will be binding across the sector to which it relates and will be enforceable by the National Employment Rights Authority.</p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that this approach is not reflective of the system struck down by the Supreme Court which provided for employment agreements made between trade unions and employer representatives being given general application by being registered by the Labour Court.

This will see a reduction in the number of agencies or bodies under the remit of my Department fall by 41.  This includes the dissolution of 35 City and County Enterprise Boards, the merging of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, the integration of Forf&aacute;s into the Department, the integration of Shannon Development into a new Shannon Group and the consolidation of the five workplace relations bodies into two.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which was established on 31 October, has a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law and will build on the work of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to protect and strengthen competition, empower consumers to make informed decisions and protect them from harmful business practices.<br/><br/>The transfer of enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and tourism functions to Bord F&aacute;ilte took place during the last quarter of 2013.  The legislation to merge Shannon Development and Shannon Airport into a new commercial state company, State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, was enacted on 27 July 2014.  Responsibility for the newly formed Shannon Group PLC rests with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<br/><br/>As the Deputy may be aware, last year, the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards were dissolved under the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act, 2014, and on the same day 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) were established.  Under the legislation, the functions, assets and liabilities were transferred to Enterprise Ireland (EI), and these functions are now being delivered on behalf of EI by the LEOs.  The reformed structure provides a service which amalgamates national enterprise policy and local business supports in order to strengthen the local business culture and environment.  The LEO structure combines the expert knowledge of the former County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), the Business Development expertise of the Local Authorities, overseen by the dedicated National Centre of Excellence in Enterprise Ireland which ensures that &lsquo;best-practice&rsquo; prevails across the LEO network.<br/><br/>Forf&aacute;s was integrated into my Department with effect from 1 August 2014 under the Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Act, 2014.  As part of this integration the functions of the Irish National Accreditation Board were transferred from Forf&aacute;s to the Health and Safety Authority.<br/><br/>A  Reform Programme also underway will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission.  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.<br/><br/>There will be savings made as a result of shared services and abolition of Boards but, more importantly, the new streamlined structures will provide a quicker, simpler and improved service for the taxpayer.<br/><br/>Details of the position to end December 2014 on the above and other measures are set out in the table below as follows:<table><tr><th><div>Measure</div></th><th><div>Position to end December 2014</div></th><th><div>Associated annual savings </div></th><th><div>Reduction in Staff</div></th></tr><tr><td>Merge the National Consumer Agency (NCA) and the Competition Authority into one single entity</td><td>The Competition and consumer Protection Act 2014 (No. 29 of 2014) amongst other things, provided for the establishment of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the dissolution of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  The establishment day for the CCPC was 31st October 2014</td><td>Prior to the amalgamation there already has been expenditure in the legacy organisations associated with the establishment of the new body.  Savings of approximately &euro;170,000 per annum will be achieved as there will be no fees for a Board or Chairperson to be paid (or associated costs such as travel and subsistence for Board members) while some minor savings might be realised in other areas</td><td>In 2008 when the merger was first announced, the combined ECF figure for both organisations was 139 whereas in 2014, the directly comparable figure was 86.  (In 2010 an extra 20 posts were added to the ECF of the NCA to cover the new functions assigned to the NCA under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 in the financial services area.)</td></tr><tr><td>Dissolve the 35 County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and transfer their functions to Enterprise Ireland (EI).</td><td>The 35 City and County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were legally dissolved on 15th April 2014 and their functions, assets and liabilities transferred to Enterprise Ireland.</td><td>Over time it is expected that there will be some savings from the removal of costs associated with the individual company status of each CEB.  In addition, the use of shared services and the reduced rental costs associated with the relocation of offices will result in savings.</td><td>Not applicable</td></tr><tr><td>Dissolve Forf&aacute;s and provide for the transfer of the agency&rsquo;s assets, liabilities and staff to my Department and other bodies, as appropriate.</td><td>The Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Act 2014 which provided for the transfer of the functions and staff of Forf&aacute;s to my Department and a number of State agencies was enacted in July 2014.  <br /><br />Forf&aacute;s was integrated into my Department with effect from 1st August.  <br /><br /></td><td>The rationale for integrating Forf&aacute;s into my Department was to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy. The integration will facilitate improvements in the use of existing resources against the backdrop of the moratorium on Public Sector recruitment. <br /><br /><br /><br />The dissolution of Forf&aacute;s gives rise to a potential saving on Board Fees of approx. &euro;100,000 per annum.</td><td>Not applicable</td></tr><tr><td>Transfer relevant enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and Bord F&aacute;ilte and merge Shannon Development with Shannon Airport</td><td>Shannon Development&rsquo;s functions and the associated staff in relation to indigenous enterprises and foreign direct investment have been transferred to Enterprise Ireland and IDA respectively.  Shannon Development&rsquo;s functions in relation to tourism including the Regional Tourism Offices have been transferred to F&aacute;ilte Ireland. These changes have been accompanied by the redeployment of staff to other public bodies and the implementation of a voluntary redundancy scheme.  The restructuring of Shannon Development has been completed.  The Government recently approved legislation &quot;State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014&quot; to establish the Shannon Group as part of a drive to establish an International Aviation Services Centre in the mid-west with the aim of delivering new routes and new jobs for the region.</td><td>This is a restructuring and merger of Shannon Development and Shannon Airport.  As Shannon Development was self-financing there was no direct cost saving to my Department. There was, however, an elimination of duplication of roles between Shannon Development, Enterprise Agencies and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the region.  This restructuring resulted in significant savings for the Exchequer.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services to deliver a simplified two-tier structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court</td><td>The process of establishing a new two-tier workplace relations structure is continuing.  <br /><br />Significant progress has been achieved to date in relation to the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the Workplace Relations Reform Programme, including the establishment of a Shared Workplace Relations Customer Relations, a Shared Post-Registration Unit and an Early Resolution Service, the completion of the design of a Customer Relationship Management Solution, the transfer of the Equality Tribunal to the Department, the launch of an e-complaint facility and Workplace Relations website, the design of an Adjudicator training programme, the holding of an open recruitment competition for Adjudicators and the design and implementation of enhanced technologies and business processes.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Workplace Relations Bill 2014, which will give legislative effect to the reforms, was published on 30th July, 2014.  The Bill has completed Second Stage and Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il in 2014.  Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il are scheduled to resume in January, 2015.  It is my intention to have the Bill enacted during Q1 2015 with a view to establishing the new workplace relations structures shortly thereafter.</td><td>The annual cost of the Workplace Relations Services amounted to just over &euro;20 million in 2010.  It is expected that significant savings, in terms of both reductions in staff numbers and increased efficiency and productivity, will be generated by this Reform Programme.<br /><br />Annual savings of <br /><br />&euro;2 million per annum.</td><td>Staff reduction of 30 will be generated under the initial phase.</td></tr><tr><td>Discover Science and Engineering (DSE) Programme</td><td>In March 2012, responsibility for the DSE Programme transferred from Forf&aacute;s to Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).  The programme is now named SFI Discover</td><td>The transfer of DSE to SFI resulted from synergies between the DSE programme and SFI&rsquo;s outreach programmes, and this transfer of responsibility was not by itself expected to generate cost savings. The integration of these programmes has achieved economies of scale, minimised duplication of effort, and contributed to operational efficiencies.</td><td>Not applicable</td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) to the Government</td><td>The Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser was included in the bodies due for critical review under the Public Sector Reform initiative. Following a Government decision in October 2012 to abolish the separate Office of the CSA, the Director General of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) took responsibility for the role of Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government in addition to his existing role and co-terminous with his tenure as Director General of SFI. </td><td>There is an annual savings of &euro;120,000 arising from this efficiency. </td><td>1 post - Chief Scientific Adviser</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It would require a very significant redirection of Departmental resources to seek to provide dis-aggregated travel data specific only to the category of journey requested.<br/><br/>It should be noted that inspectors for NERA are regionally based and hearings for the Employment Appeals Tribunal are similarly organised.  To identify travel or expenses solely incurred on the basis sought would be extremely difficult.  I can, however, advise the Deputy that travel and subsistence payments are made in line with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform instructions and travel is only authorised having due regard to value for money.  Travel costs are generally paid at the applicable return train fare rates save in exceptional circumstances where an officer is required to transport a significant level of files or equipment to/from Dublin and mileage would accrue in respect of the use by the officer of his/her car.  Finally, Video Conferencing facilities are available in all decentralised offices and in Dublin, and these facilities are regularly used to facilitate staff attending meetings without the need to travel. Likewise, where appropriate, Video Conferencing is also regularly used to conduct business between the Department and our colleagues in the Permanent Representation in Brussels.<br/><br/>I have asked all Agencies under the aegis of my Department to advise me of their response, and I will communicate that information to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p></reply>

There are currently 117 such centres across the country.</p>  <p>  There are currently no specific proposals to extend the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme to fund Business Development Management in 2015.  The last scheme rolled out was in 2012 and 2013 when Enterprise Ireland provided funding of &euro;2 million to support the recruitment of a total of 46 Business Development Managers.</p>  <p>  On the wider issue of the Centres, the success levels, occupancy levels and sustainability of jobs at the Centres varies and therefore I have asked Enterprise Ireland to review the operations of the Community Enterprise Centres in the context of regional enterprise development and how the Community Enterprise Centres and the Local Enterprise Offices might work more closely in support of business start-ups before giving further consideration to the matter.</p>  <p>  There are a number of dimensions to this issue, including the role of other players such as the Local Authorities, private sector involvement and the level of supply and demand for business space in the locality.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders, including Community Enterprise Centres, in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in the regions.  While there is already a significant amount of practical cooperation taking place at local and regional levels between many public bodies, developing a framework in which cooperation can be improved, is timely.</p>  <p>  I have been actively working on a template for the development of Regional Enterprise Strategies and it is my intention that this framework will be applied initially on a pilot basis to produce action-oriented plans to support enterprise growth and jobs in the Midlands region and the South East region.  These pilots will inform any adaptations that might need to be made prior to the framework being applied to other regions.  I fully expect that the existing network of Community Enterprise Centres will have a role to play in the creation and implementation of enterprise strategies in their regions.</p></reply>

Data is gathered on an annual basis and aggregated at county level. It is therefore not possible to provide separate figues for Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin, as requested by the Deputy.  The survey shows that over the past three years there have been a total of 45,331 gross new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies.  The attached tabular statement (A) shows, on a county by county basis the total number IDA client company jobs in each of the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 as well as the number of jobs created and lost in each of those years.<br/><br/>I am informed by IDA Ireland that site sponsored visits by potential investors are tracked on a county by county basis only and during 2012, 2013 and 2014 there were a total of 1,063 such visits to various locations across the country.  Details of the number of site visits during this period are set out in the attached tabular statement (B).  It must also be remembered that decisions as to where to visit and where to locate is ultimately a matter for the investor.<br/><br/>Foreign direct investment (FDI) is key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  I am glad to inform the Deputy that IDA Ireland&rsquo;s end of year results show that 2014 was another record year for investment wins and job creation, with over 7,000 net new jobs being created in the Agency&rsquo;s client companies.  Total employment at IDA Ireland client companies now stands at 174,488 people, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.<br/><br/>I have been working with my Department on the development on a framework for the formulation of Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to identify the sustainable competitive strengths of each region and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in areas of potential.  A key element of this process is the Regional Enterprise Forum, which I chairedin Athlone on 19 December last.  I hope to publish the framework strategy shortly.  The Regional strategy will be rolled out firstly in the Midlands before being rolled out in other regions and will include specific actions and targets on the part of my Department, the enterprise development agencies and other public bodies to promote enterprise growth and job creation in the region.<br/><br/><b>TABLE A</b><br/><br/><b>Table shows the total number of IDA Ireland jobs, number

Export sales growth leads to an increase in demand for Irish goods and services, and increases the flow of income into the Irish economy.  This is fundamental to job creation and maintenance in Ireland.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland works with entrepreneurs and business people across the full business development spectrum - from early-stage entrepreneurs, to established business owners and Irish multinational companies. Enterprise Ireland clients include:<br/><br/>- High Potential Start-Up companies with the capability to start a business and sell in export markets.<br/><br/>- Established manufacturing and internationally traded services businesses that are .<br/><br/>- Large companies (employing more than 250).<br/><br/>- Irish-based food and natural resource companies that are overseas-owned or controlled.<br/><br/>On 12/1/2015, Enterprise Ireland had approximately 6,000 clients on their database which are trading or pre-trading and at various stages of the business development spectrum broken down by county as shown in the Table below.

The ultimate objective is increased employment and prosperity in Ireland.  The companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland.<br/><br/>In its &ldquo;End of Year Statement&rdquo; published on Monday, January 12, Enterprise Ireland reported that client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014.  This resulted in a net increase of 8,476 in the total number of people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, the highest net gain in the history of the Agency.<br/><br/>Total direct employment (full and part time) in Enterprise Ireland client companies stood at 180,072 in 2014.  Of these, 156,202 were full-time jobs, while 23,870 were part-time.<br/><br/>This continuation of employment growth demonstrates clearly the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland supported companies now, directly and indirectly, account for more than 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy - 16% of total workforce.Significantly, Enterprise Ireland clients recorded the lowest level of job losses since 2000.<br/><br/>These employment figures reinforce Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy of driving innovation, scale and leadership positions in international markets and new sectors.<br/><br/>The Table below breaks down the employment by County for 2012 and 2013.

Employment data for Enterprise Ireland is collected annually as part of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Annual Employment Survey which measures the number of jobs in Agency assisted client companies.  In its &ldquo;End of Year Statement&rdquo; published on Monday, January 12, Enterprise Ireland reported that client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014.  This resulted in a net increase of 8,476 in the total number of people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is on the economic benefits that can be achieved through its financial supports.  All financial approvals are underpinned by a continued focus on ensuring positive economic impact and value for money for the taxpayer.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s investments have also performed favourably over the years in terms of financial return on the investment.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland financially supports a significant number of Irish companies across the company developmental lifecycle by way of equity and grant aid, a high proportion of these being start-ups in an early stage of development.  Investing in early stage companies is inherently risky, particularly in the very early stages of company development.<br/><br/>Many of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s early stage companies require substantial funding to develop a final market offering.  Enterprise Ireland, when making an investment, will always seek that the company raises matching funding from the private sector or that they invest off their own Balance Sheet to support the particular project or company development.  This private sector participation can come from a diverse range of sources of capital and debt.<br/><br/>In order to reduce the investment risk Enterprise Ireland also requires that the private sector&rsquo;s funding contribution must constitute at least 50% or more of the total funding support.  This ensures that the private sector shares a larger proportion of the investment risk.  Commercial success however is never guaranteed.<br/><br/>In the case of grant aid, the company has to provide evidence of expenditure on their part before a grant payment is released.<br/><br/>The total amount of income generated through equity gains and grant repayments to Enterprise Ireland (grant refunds, dividends and redemption/sale of shares), over the period 2011 to 2014, amounted to &euro;119m (Table 1).<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland writes off investments where a company is being liquidated or is being wound up.  The average level of impairment (write-offs) associated with Enterprise Ireland equity investments in client companies that fail (based on investment periods of ten years and older) is 21%.  Before any investment or grant is written off Enterprise Ireland conducts a thorough due diligence process to ensure that all monies, if any, which are recoverable by Enterprise Ireland, have been recovered.<br/><br/>These impairments can be attributed to companies not achieving market success, in what has been a difficult economic period.<br/><br/>These losses have to be considered within the wider economic and monetary gains generated through the EI equity portfolio.  EI continues to actively manage the balance of its portfolio with a view to maximising the economic benefits and the financial return.<br/><br/><b>Income generated through equity gains and grant repayments to Enterprise Ireland</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Provisional</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>2014</td><td>2013</td><td>2012</td><td>2011</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;'000</td><td>&euro;'000</td><td>&euro;'000</td><td>&euro;'000</td><td>&euro;'000</td></tr><tr><td>Expenditure</td><td>95,250</td><td>93,615</td><td>106,099</td><td>109,191</td><td>404,155</td></tr><tr><td>Income</td><td>30,818</td><td>27,654</td><td>22,332</td><td>38,209</td><td>119,013</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Statistics in relation to the number of clients supported and jobs created in 2014 through support provided by the LEOs are currently being compiled as part of the LEO Annual Employment Survey of client companies.  It is expected that the information will be available later this Quarter.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the system for delivery of support to micro and small enterprises was reformed last year to make the operating environment for businesses more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship at local level.  The LEOs are now the first-stop-shop for those beginning a new business as well as those wishing to expand their existing one. The LEOs provide financial and non-financial supports to help micro and small businesses to expand their growth potential and the LEO staff can advise clients directly or direct them to the most appropriate source of support for their project.<br/><br/>As part of the process of restructuring the enterprise supports for micro-enterprises, the metrics previously being used by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were revised and extended to make them more relevant as a means of reporting on the performance of the LEOs.<br/><br/>Each LEO is developing a Local Enterprise Development Plan for 2015 which will aim at further boosting enterprise growth within the area within their remit by building on the achievements to date and setting targets for job creation and enterprise growth in their area.  Key targets in the Plans will include new business start-ups, business expansions and jobs created or sustained as well as wider economic impacts such as exports, mentoring, training and enterprise promotion.  It is expected that this reform will continue the momentum for sustained growth in job creation in each County across the country.<br/><br/><b>Table 1: CEB / LEO Client and Employment Statistics 2012 / 2013</b><table><tr><th>CEB / LEO </th><th>Full Time Gains 2012</th><th>Other Time Gains 2012</th><th>Full Time Gains 2013</th><th>Other Time Gains 2013</th><th>Active Clients 2012 (exc Ceased Trading)</th><th>Active Clients 2013 (exc Ceased Trading)</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>254</td><td>165</td><td>278</td><td>124</td><td>230</td><td>211</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>138</td><td>150</td><td>117</td><td>121</td><td>231</td><td>233</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>200</td><td>105</td><td>114</td><td>51</td><td>447</td><td>464</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>52</td><td>19</td><td>67</td><td>23</td><td>202</td><td>185</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>59</td><td>12</td><td>67</td><td>15</td><td>72</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>Cork South</td><td>179</td><td>97</td><td>264</td><td>156</td><td>274</td><td>278</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>83</td><td>58</td><td>75</td><td>88</td><td>185</td><td>177</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>131</td><td>255</td><td>233</td><td>116</td><td>265</td><td>257</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>382</td><td>183</td><td>75</td><td>2</td><td>709</td><td>757</td></tr><tr><td>DunLaoghaire/Rathdown</td><td>337</td><td>511</td><td>254</td><td>128</td><td>362</td><td>353</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Fingal</td><td>240</td><td>135</td><td>270</td><td>204</td><td>320</td><td>339</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South</td><td>168</td><td>135</td><td>190</td><td>142</td><td>362</td><td>379</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County/City</td><td>124</td><td>78</td><td>91</td><td>86</td><td>572</td><td>572</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>316</td><td>199</td><td>389</td><td>234</td><td>507</td><td>459</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>133</td><td>77</td><td>217</td><td>93</td><td>167</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>84</td><td>30</td><td>242</td><td>169</td><td>311</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>69</td><td>98</td><td>136</td><td>126</td><td>201</td><td>175</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>35</td><td>32</td><td>48</td><td>37</td><td>244</td><td>243</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City</td><td>100</td><td>96</td><td>132</td><td>70</td><td>194</td><td>178</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County</td><td>73</td><td>2</td><td>91</td><td>7</td><td>345</td><td>362</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>79</td><td>55</td><td>121</td><td>87</td><td>282</td><td>289</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>148</td><td>84</td><td>155</td><td>92</td><td>317</td><td>226</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>43</td><td>35</td><td>71</td><td>89</td><td>281</td><td>288</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>175</td><td>145</td><td>233</td><td>63</td><td>347</td><td>277</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>120</td><td>83</td><td>96</td><td>36</td><td>145</td><td>147</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>75</td><td>41</td><td>74</td><td>112</td><td>195</td><td>204</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>81</td><td>53</td><td>46</td><td>19</td><td>217</td><td>214</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>117</td><td>144</td><td>86</td><td>119</td><td>246</td><td>253</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary(NR)</td><td>41</td><td>53</td><td>49</td><td>30</td><td>214</td><td>220</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary(SR)</td><td>53</td><td>10</td><td>139</td><td>126</td><td>248</td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City</td><td>76</td><td>64</td><td>160</td><td>67</td><td>274</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County</td><td>110</td><td>97</td><td>113</td><td>41</td><td>249</td><td>266</td></tr><tr><td>WestMeath</td><td>130</td><td>97</td><td>199</td><td>140</td><td>266</td><td>265</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>269</td><td>140</td><td>309</td><td>157</td><td>335</td><td>326</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>184</td><td>234</td><td>77</td><td>372</td><td>217</td><td>203</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>4,858</td><td>3,772</td><td>5,278</td><td>3,542</td><td>10,033</td><td>9,717</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Resources normally invested in inspection work were assigned to this initiative.  Over 50 such talks were held and were attended by over 2,000 farmers.<br/><br/>I am particularly concerned at the high level of farm fatalities and it goes without saying that safety in agriculture will continue to be a high priority for the HSA and for the Government in 2015.<br/><br/>I have addressed this issue on a number of occasions at events such as the Ploughing Championships, the HSA/NISO Conference and, most recently, with my EU level colleagues at the December EU EPSCO Council.<br/><br/>I met with Commissioner Marianne Thyssen in early December and we discussed the increased rate of fatalities in on farms and how to strengthen links between mainstream occupational, safety and health (OSH) policies and other EU policies in fields such as agriculture that have a high workplace accident record.  I am pleased to see from recent reports that Commissioner Hogan is considering how CAP incentives might be linked to compliance with farm safety practices.<br/><br/>Looking at what we can do nationally, the HSA adopts a broad based partnership approach to maximise its impact across the agriculture sector.  To this end the Farm Safety Partnership (FSP) includes among others representatives from all the farming organisations, the Department of Agriculture and Teagasc as well as my own Department.  An example of this collaborative approach is the launch in April 2014 by the HSA and Minister Coveney of the &quot;Safe Slurry handling&quot; DVD.  This DVD was produced in partnership with Irish Rural Link and this was made possible through a &euro;50k grant payment from my Department to the HSA.<br/><br/>I welcome the new approach to enforcement by the Authority under which it will (on a case by case basis) consider going straight to prosecution on certain matters which involve a very high risk of serious injury or death e.g. unguarded PTO assemblies.<br/><br/>The HSA will also be extending BeSMART &ndash; the free online risk assessment and safety statement tool to the agriculture sector in 2016, facilitating easy compliance with requirements and raising awareness of a risk based approach to health and safety.<br/><br/>Finally, the advisory and enforcement activity of the HSA complements the suite of programmes developed by the Department of Agriculture.  For example the Farm Safety Scheme which opened in October last year and aims to improve the standard of safety on Irish farms by providing grant-aid for a number of specified investment items.</p></reply>

At that time both Ministers appealed to farmers and all involved in the agriculture sector to increase their safety awareness and ensure that safety became part of a daily routine.</p>  <p>  Since my appointment I have attended the National Ploughing Championships where I met farming representatives and discussed the prevention of farm accidents.  I also assisted the HSA and Teagasc in launching their joint Farm Safety and Health Training Programme.  At this launch I emphasised the good working relationship between the two state agencies working towards a common goal.</p>  <p>  Last December the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Simon Coveney TD and I attended the launch of &ldquo;Too Cold for Sharks&rdquo;, a children&rsquo;s publication for families involved in fishing.  The educational approach used to develop this publication followed the model of the successful farm safety awareness initiative by the HSA in 2013.  The launch of the children&rsquo;s book in December 2014 presented a further opportunity to discuss farm safety issues.</p>  <p>  The Farm Safety Partnership (FSP) is the platform for developing coordinated initiatives on awareness raising, safety promotion, research, etc, and includes among others representatives from all the farming organisations, the Department of Agriculture and Teagasc as well as my own Department.  Positive outputs from this collaborative approach include the launch in April 2014 by the HSA and Minister Coveney of the "Safe Slurry handling" DVD.  This DVD was produced in partnership with Irish Rural Link and this was made possible through a &euro;50k grant payment from my Department to the HSA.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food will continue to engage proactively on this issue with a view to reversing the current trend in unprecedented levels of farm fatalities.</p></reply>

For a variety of reasons many companies do not wish for any publicity surrounding a proposed investment and therefore of the 653 investments approved by IDA Ireland less than half, approximately 300, have been publicly announced.  As a result it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the total investments by location as requested by the Deputy.  The following tabular statement (A) is a listing of those investments announced by IDA Ireland in the period 2011 to 2014.<br/><br/>In relation to the impact of those investments, it is important to acknowledge the natural time lag between an announcement of an investment and the coming on stream of that project which can be between 3 and 5 years in some cases.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery and the recruitment and training of suitable staff.  <br/><br/>The level of investments coming on stream is best measured by the number of new jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Forfas Annual Employment Survey. The following tabular statement (B) sets out on a county by county basis the number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in each year from 2011 to 2014 inclusive.<br/><br/><b>TABLE A:

Information on grant refunds and grant payments is made available by the Agency. <br/><br/>A grant may be approved in a given year but, once the relevant conditions of the grant agreement have been complied with, it is a matter for the individual company when it chooses to draw down the grant.  It would therefore not be possible to provide a figure on a yearly basis of grants that have been awarded but not drawn down.  <br/><br/>Refunds to IDA Ireland of grant payments made occur where companies have either closed or are not in compliance with conditions set out in their Grant Agreement.  The attached tabular statement sets out the amounts of grants paid and grant refunds for the years 2011 to 2013 inclusive. Figures for 2014 will not be available until after the accounts have been signed off on by the Comptroller and Auditor General later in the year.  <br/><br/><b>Table showing the amount of grants paid by IDA Ireland and refunded to the agency in each of the years 2011 to 2013 inclusive </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Grants Paid</th><th>Grants refunded </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;96,757,220</td><td>&euro;18,797,684 </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;89,326,201</td><td>&euro;3,131,797 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;87,951,297</td><td>&euro;2,443,564 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

For a variety of reasons many companies do not wish for any publicity surrounding a proposed investment.  The number of investments approved in each individual year from 2011 to 2014 is set out in the attached tabular statement. It should be noted that the number of investments approved has risen from 148 in 2011 to 197 in 2014.<br/><br/>It is important to point out that there is often a time lag, in the region of 3 to 5 years, between an announcement of an investment and the coming on stream of that project.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery and the recruitment and training of suitable staff.  Given these factors it is not possible to give an accurate figure for the number of projects which proceed and which do not proceed.  <br/><br/>The level of investments coming on stream is best measured by the number of new jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Forfas Annual Employment Survey, which tracks the jobs gained and lost in companies that are supported by enterprise development agencies.  Preliminary results from that survey show that in 2014 client companies of IDA Ireland created a total of 15,012 gross new jobs.  When job losses are taken into account the survey shows that 7,131 net jobs were created during 2014 as opposed to 5,595 in 2011.  There are now 174,488 people employed in IDA client companies, the highest figure on record.  <br/><br/><b>Table showing the number of IDA investment approved in each of the years 2011 to 2014 inclusive</b><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>Number of Investments </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>148</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>144</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>164</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>197</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Low Pay Commission will consist of:</p>  <p>  - An independent chairperson</p>  <p>  - Three people with a deep understanding of the interests of low paid workers, preferably with a proven track record of working on behalf of the low paid</p>  <p>  - Three people with a deep understanding of employer interests, preferably where the national minimum wage is relevant and who have good knowledge of issues such as labour costs and competitiveness challenges facing Irish businesses</p>  <p>  - Two members with experience of economics,  labour market economics, statistics or employment law </p>  <p>  With the exception of the position of chairperson, the appointment process is being managed by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).

Legislation to provide for the establishment of the LPC on a statutory basis will be published as soon as possible with a view to its early enactment and it is intended that the interim membership will constitute the Commission when it is established on a statutory basis.</p></reply>

The attached tabular statement (A) sets out, on a county by county basis, the number of site visits by potential investors during 2014.<br/><br/>2014 was a record year for IDA Ireland with 197 investments being secured for Ireland and 15,012 gross new jobs being created in IDA Ireland client companies.  There was a notable rise in new name investments with 88 new name investments being secured in 2014.  For a variety of reasons many companies do not wish for any publicity surrounding a proposed investments and many projects proceed without being publicly announced. During 2014, there were only 66 investment announcements, of which 38 were new projects with the balance being made up of expansion projects. The announcements lists for the period 2011 to 2014 are attached at Table B.<br/><br/>In relation to the impact of those investments, it is important to acknowledge the natural time lag between an announcement of an investment and the coming on stream of that project which can be between 3 and 5 years in some cases.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery and the recruitment and training of suitable staff.<br/><br/>Because of the time lag it is not possible to compare the numbers of jobs announced with the numbers of jobs created. In any given year the number of jobs created exceeds the number of jobs announced. Taking 2014 as an example the job announcements indicated a potential job creation figure in region of 7,000 jobs whereas the actual number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in 2014  was in fact 15,012.<br/><br/>The level of investments coming on stream is best measured by the number of new jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Forfas Annual Employment Survey.

Tipperary in 2014.<br/><br/>In 2014, there were 11 IDA client companies in County Tipperary employing 3,370.  64 new jobs were created in IDA Ireland client companies during the year.  The attached tabular statement sets out on a county by county basis the number of new jobs created  in IDA Ireland client companies during 2014.<br/><br/>Foreign direct investment (FDI) is key to Ireland's economic recovery.  I am glad to inform the Deputy that IDA Ireland's end of year results show that 2014 was another record year for investment wins and job creation, with over 7,000 net new jobs being created in the Agency&rsquo;s client companies.  Total employment at IDA Ireland client companies now stands at 174,488 people, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.  <br/><br/>I have been working with my Department on the development on a framework for the formulation of Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to identify the sustainable competitive strengths of each region and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in areas of potential.  A key element of this process is the Regional Enterprise Forum, which I chaired in Athlone on 19<sup>th</sup>December last.  I hope to publish the framework strategy shortly.  The Regional strategy will be rolled out firstly in the Midlands before being rolled out in other regions and will include specific actions and targets on the part of my Department, the enterprise development agencies and other public bodies to promote enterprise growth and job creation in the region.<br/><br/><b>NEW IDA IRELAND-SUPPORTED JOBS CREATED BY COUNTY during 2014</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th></th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>436</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>2,312</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>247</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>7,149</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>1,099</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>247</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>637</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>756</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>494</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>294</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>New Jobs Created</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary N Riding</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary S Riding</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>285</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>176</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>New Jobs Created </td><td>15,012</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Work on the transposition of the Directive is proceeding in my Department at present to ensure that the relevant transposition deadline is met as well as on the legal instruments to lay-down sanctions, etc. as required by the Regulation on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes.  It is intended that both of these measures will be done by way of secondary legislation.</p>  <p>  My Department undertook a public consultation process in June 2014 on how the EU Directive on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes might be applied in Ireland.  Fourteen responses from a variety of interested parties were received.  The contents of these submissions will form an input into what arrangements might be put in place to make alternative dispute resolution procedures available to consumers when the transposition process has concluded.

Though some respondents had reservations about specific aspects of the proposed legislation, the submissions were broadly supportive of the aim to update and consolidate the law on consumer contract rights along the lines set out in the Consultation Paper.  As indicated in the Consultation Paper, the next stage will involve publication of the Scheme of a comprehensive Consumer Rights Bill dealing with rights and remedies in transactions for the sale or supply of goods, digital content and services.  This will give stakeholders an opportunity to submit views on more detailed aspects of the legislative proposals not dealt with in the initial consultation, as well as to comment on a more final version of the main provisions of the legislation.  I hope to publish the Scheme of the Bill in the first quarter of the year.  </p></reply>

The use of Own Resource Income has allowed us to maintain the overall level of investment in support of job creation over the past four years, where direct Exchequer allocations have been required to be scaled back, as with all other areas.  The table attached sets out the outturn figures for the period 2011 to 2014 and includes the 2015 allocation recently published in the Revised Estimate.  The sanction sought for ORI for 2015 is in line with previous years.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, the past four years have seen all Departments operating in a challenging fiscal environment.  However, over the period 2011 to 2014, my Department has had funding available to support our job creation objectives of &euro;2.27 Billion in Capital across a range of activities, from the provision of direct supports to client companies of the enterprise agency clients to the provision of an enterprise focussed research and innovation system. <br/><br/>The investment by my Department is aligned to and underpins the objectives for recovery and transformation of the enterprise base as set out in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs. The Action Plan for Jobs is a multi-annual strategy initiated in 2012 to ensure a cross-government approach to optimising the environment for enterprise, such that a net additional 100,000 jobs will be created by 2016. <br/><br/>I am pleased to report that good progress is being made on the implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  My Department is currently completing the preparation of the 2015 Action Plan.  Ireland's ranking in terms of competitiveness and ease of doing business continue to improve.  On the jobs front, the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey, as of Q3 2014 indicates that 80,000 additional people are at work compared to Q1 2012 when the Government launched the Action Plan for jobs.  The enterprise agencies of my Department reported record levels of job creation by their client companies again for 2014.  From 2011 to 2014 direct employment in EI supported companies has increased by 16,420 and direct employment in IDA supported companies is up by 22,265 over the period.  These direct jobs have also supported the creation of a similar number of indirect jobs in the wider economy through purchases of materials and services locally. <br/><br/>The 2014 Action Plan contains 385 actions to be implemented in 2014 by all 16 Government Departments and by 46 agencies.  Cumulatively to the end of the 3rd Quarter 89% of those scheduled for delivery have been implemented.  These actions cover delivery of supports for enterprise, actions to develop sectoral opportunities and measures that will strengthen the competitiveness and capacity of our economy to support job growth. <br/><br/>There are also a series of cross cutting Disruptive Reforms being advanced in 2014.  They include critical areas where we can win an edge across many sectors and include Big Data/Analytics; ICT Skills; Trading Online; Energy Efficiency; and National Health Innovation Hub. Entrepreneurship; Winning Abroad; and Manufacturing: National Step Change. Each are well advanced in terms of implementation. <br/><br/>Some examples of important initiatives implemented in 2014 include:<br/><br/>- Launch of Local Enterprise Offices<br/><br/>- Launch of &quot;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur&quot; competition<br/><br/>- New staff in overseas office EI and IDA<br/><br/>- Record levels of new investment by EI and IDA enterprises<br/><br/>- Delivered Smart Futures science, technology and engineering awareness programme<br/><br/>The process involved in APJ has proved effective in driving reforms in the past three years.<table><tr><th>&euro;m</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014 (Provisional)</th></tr><tr><td>Total* </td><td>570.928</td><td>586.433</td><td>551.161</td><td>556.356</td></tr></table>* Includes Total Capital, Capital Carryover plus Own Resource Income Sanctioned, which includes a small amount of current spend. </p></reply>

In many cases, these announcements will set out the job creation plans of the enterprises for a number of years into the future and the Department and its agencies work closely with the promoters to ensure that the jobs envisaged are realised.<br/><br/>I should point out however, that some job creation projects in agency client companies are not announced by the agencies, for example, in cases where the company involved does not wish this to happen.<br/><br/>Accordingly, job announcements are not reflective of the ongoing work of the Agencies in terms of their respective investment in individual companies, which result over time, in job creation. <br/><br/>Employment growth in EI clients in Cork has shown continuous growth over the last four years.  Indicative figures from the latest DJEI 2014 Employment Survey show total employment in Cork-based EI clients increasing by around 8% between 2013 and 2014. (Official county based data for 2014 will be available shortly).<br/><br/>Between 2011 and 2014, Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;64 million specifically to support development projects undertaken by its 600 plus Cork based client companies.  <br/><br/>Indicative figures for the period 2011 to 2014 show that the number of IDA Ireland client companies located in Cork, city and county, increased from 135 in 2011 to 146 in 2014, while the total numbers employed in those companies increased by 3,564, rising from 24,981 in 2011 to 28,545 an increase of 14 %.<br/><br/>The following tabular statement sets out details of the employment data for Cork, for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland respectively.<br/><br/>Press releases relating to job creation issued by my Department&rsquo;s Press Office are available at .<br/><br/>Details of Enterprise Ireland's job announcements and those of IDA Ireland are also published on their respective websites &ndash; ; .<br/><br/>We will forward a list of individual announcements directly to the Deputy.<br/><br/><b>Table 1: Enterprise Ireland employment data for Cork from the 'Annual Employment Survey'</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>Number Of Companies</td><td>689</td><td>690</td><td>669</td></tr><tr><td>Full Time Jobs</td><td>18,100</td><td>19,008</td><td>19,775</td></tr><tr><td>Full-time Gains</td><td>2,055</td><td>1,751</td><td>1,741</td></tr><tr><td>Full-time Losses</td><td>674</td><td>843</td><td>974</td></tr><tr><td>Full-time Change</td><td>1,381</td><td>908</td><td>767</td></tr><tr><td>Other Jobs</td><td>2,162</td><td>2,221</td><td>2,437</td></tr></table><b>*</b>Employment Data for 2014 is being finalised and will be available shortly.  <br/><br/><b>Table 2: IDA Ireland employment data for Cork from the &lsquo;Annual Employment Survey&rsquo;</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>No of Companies</td><td>135</td><td>140</td><td>147</td></tr><tr><td>Total Jobs</td><td>24,981</td><td>26,263</td><td>27,399</td></tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created (gross gains)</td><td>2,187</td><td>2,395</td><td>2,139</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Losses</td><td>-1,189</td><td>-1,113</td><td>-1,003</td></tr><tr><td>Net Change</td><td>998</td><td>1,282</td><td>1,136</td></tr></table><b>*</b>Employment Data for 2014 is being finalised and will be available shortly.  </p></reply>

The numbers of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland supported businesses in the past four years are set out in Tables 1 and 2 below.<br/><br/>As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I introduced a collaborative, cross- government approach to advancing job creation in the State.  The Action Plan for Jobs is an annual plan designed to drive action across all Government Departments and Agencies in a collective effort to put in place the conditions needed to support and grow employment in the State.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s mission is to support indigenous industry, working with entrepreneurs, Irish businesses, and the research and investment communities to develop Ireland&rsquo;s international trade, innovation and competitiveness.  The ultimate objective is increased employment and prosperity in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland works with High Potential Start-ups (HPSUs) with a capability to start a business and sell in export markets, Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing and internationally traded services, large companies employing 250 or more, and, Irish-based food and natural resource companies that are overseas owned or controlled.<br/><br/>In its &quot;End of Year Statement&quot; published on Monday, January 12, Enterprise Ireland reported that client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014.  This resulted in a net increase of 8,476 in the total number of people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, the highest net gain in the history of the Agency.  This increase in employment reinforces Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy of driving innovation, scale and leadership positions in international markets and new sectors. <br/><br/>This continuation of employment growth demonstrates clearly the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland supported companies now, directly and indirectly, account for more than 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy - 16% of total workforce.  Significantly, Enterprise Ireland clients recorded the lowest level of job losses since 2000.<br/><br/>Total direct employment (full and part time) in Enterprise Ireland client companies stood at 180,072 in 2014.  Of these, 156,202 were full-time jobs, while 23,870 were part-time. <br/><br/>Total employment at IDA client companies now stands at 174,488, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.  The job performance took place against a particularly challenging European economic environment and a changing corporate taxation landscape.  IDA has now exceeded the jobs and investment targets set under its Horizon 2020 Strategy and is currently finalising a new Five Year Strategy to take the organisation into a new phase of development.<br/><br/>A dynamic talent pool in Ireland, improved macroeconomic conditions and a concentration on several core sectors were among the contributors to the strong 2014 performance.<br/><br/>There were 197 investments in 2014, equating to a 20% increase on 2013.  There was a notable rise in new name investment, with 88 new name investors in 2014, equating to a 13% increase on 2013.  Among the leading investments secured during the year were Amazon, Bristol Myers Squibb, Fidelity, LinkedIn, Survey Monkey, Air Bnb, PayPal, Ericsson, SAP, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, West Pharmaceuticals, Zendesk, Adroll and New Relic.  <br/><br/>There were job gains across most sectors IDA is focused on, but particularly in digital media/content, ICT, international financial services, life sciences and business services.<br/><br/><b>Table 1 &ndash; Number of Jobs created by Enterprise Ireland</b><br/><br/><b>Source:</b>Annual Employment Survey Results 2011 - 2014 <table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created (Gross Gains)</td><td>13,719</td><td>17,390</td><td>18,033</td><td>19,705</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b>Table 2 &ndash; Number of Jobs created by IDA</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created (Gross Gains)</td><td>14,432</td><td>15,215</td><td>15,104</td><td>15,012</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am informed by IDA Ireland that during 2014 there were 205 IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits by potential investors to Dublin City and County.  These visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and also from senior executives of existing client companies.  It must be remembered that the final decision on where to visit and where to locate are made by the investor.<br/><br/>At the end of<b></b>2014, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 596 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Dublin employing 70,989<b></b>people.  IDA Ireland works closely with these companies to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  <br/><br/>As is evidenced with IDA Ireland investment announcements over the past number of years, a significant number locate in Dublin so it is reasonable to expect that this trend will continue.<br/><br/>Typical examples of the type of investments which were announced in West Dublin during 2014 which will impact positively on the surrounding area including Tallaght,include the announcement in January  by Aspen, a global pharmaceutical company, in City West that it was expanding its Irish operation by adding 42 new high quality jobs.  These jobs will require the necessary skillsets in areas such as pharmaceutical production, quality control and assurance, regulatory affairs and supply chain management.  In April,  Alexion announced plans to expand its operations in Ireland following the acquisition of a new site in West Dublin.  The Company expects that this expansion will create approximately 200 new jobs at Alexion as part of an investment of approximately &euro;75million over the next number of years.<br/><br/>SAP announced in May that the company was increasing investment in the Business Objects Software Limited&rsquo;s Development Centre in City West with the creation of 60 jobs.<br/><br/>I am confident that these investments will have a positive impact directly and indirectly on job creation in the greater Dublin area which includes Tallaght.  </p></reply>

I understand that the TRP will set out necessary measures for implementation within each of the three sectors, to protect and conserve Hen Harrier, and in doing so, will bring clarity to farmers and other landowners about future land management activities within the SPAs.  In relation to forestry, it is envisaged that the TRP will determine, <i>inter alia</i>, the circumstances in which afforestation might be accommodated in Hen Harrier SPAs without impacting on the conservation of the species.  Until then, my Department is not in a position to grant approval for any afforestation projects in those areas until, as part of the TRP, an integrated series of measures across all three land uses has been identified to protect the species.  The Department therefore does not intend to reinstate the forest management protocol for the Hen Harrier Special Protection Areas.</p></reply>

In relation to Spurdog, the EU Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is set at zero and the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) has advised that the stock is depleted.  Spurdog spawning biomass is currently at the lowest observed level, although stable in recent years.  Spurdog is a long-lived, slow growing, and late maturing species and therefore is particularly vulnerable to fishing mortality.  ICES advice is that there should be no target fishery and that by-catch in mixed fisheries should be minimised.  It recommends that by-catches should be managed as part of a rebuilding plan, including close monitoring of the stock and fishery.  The Marine Institute supports ICES advice and further notes that spatial avoidance measures should be put in place as part of a rebuilding plan to avoid large accidental catches.  The Marine Institute advise that, considering the low stock size over the last two decades and the very low productivity of the stock, it is not possible to identify any non zero catch that would be compatible with the Maximum Sustainable Yield approach.  On this basis, the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a zero TAC for 2015 was accepted by the EU Council. <br/><br/>In relation to lesser Spotted Dogfish, this stock is not subject to a TAC and quota regime.  It is mainly a bait fishery and was not permitted under technical measures introduced in 2009 to protect the cod and whiting stocks in Area VIa (off the Donegal coast).  Trials by BIM, supported by the Marine Institute on the impact of a fishery targeting lesser spotted dogfish on cod, haddock and whiting was prepared and it allowed Ireland to successfully make the case for an amendment to the EU Regulations to allow for this fishery.  This derogation was introduced in Regulation (EU) No. 227/2013 of 13 March 2013.  The Regulation, <i>inter-alia,</i>provided for arrangements to allow for a lesser spotted dog fishery off the north Donegal coast.  The fishery is subject to a number of technical measures including a restriction on the area, length of gill net that may be deployed, maximum period of soak time, restrictions on by-catches.<br/><br/>In order to participate in this lesser spotted dogfish fishery, vessels over 10m, must be authorised in the Days at Sea Scheme to fish with Gill Nets in area VIa.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-14a.762.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011400066#WRR01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 291 and 292 together.</p><p>  Swaps of quota with other Member States are discussed in advance with the Industry at the monthly Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) meeting and also through e-mail with the QMAC. In almost all cases, the advice of the industry representatives are followed in respect of swops. </p><p>The monthly whitefish meetings are organised in accordance with a formal written protocol which I put in place in November 2013. This protocol provides that the Committee will comprise representatives from each of the 4 recognised Producer Organisation s (PO s ), the Irish Fish producers and Exporters Association   (IFPEA), the S ea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Department.  The meeting is chaired by a Department representative . Each of the Producer Organisations (PO s ) and the IFPEA are represented by a single attendee and in addition each organisation may invite one observer to the meeting. It is practice that the POs have usually one representative of a fisheries co-operative at these meetings as an invitee. Where representatives or observers have business interests related to the fishery / quota under discussion, they must advise the meeting of those business interests when giving a view on management issues.    </p><p>  It is in the interest of the industry as a whole that appropriately recognised organisations represent their interests to deliver a co-ordinated and cohesive view for the benefit of the industry. I consider that this would be very difficult if representation was at the individual level or fragmented amongst a large number of smaller ad hoc representatives groups. In addition, it is important as far as possible for the POs to develop a common position on issues, although this is not always achieved. </p><p>  Each year a number of swaps of fishing quotas and effort are arranged by the Department with other Member States. Swaps involve an exchange of fishing opportunities with another Member State and are based on financial value of the exchanges proposed. Swaps are normally initially proposed or organised by the fishing industry led by the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) which comprises the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, Irish Fish Producers&rsquo; organisation and the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Producers Organisation. The Irish South and East Producers Organisation also make proposals and each PO is consulted on swops. </p><p>In relation to the swap in 2014 between Ireland and Belgium for plaice in areas VII f,g, this was part of a swap for which Ireland received 125t Monkfish in Area VII. In return Ireland gave Belgium 150t of Plaice in VII f,g and 100t Plaice in Area VIIa. This is a long standing swop that is agreed each year between Belgium and Ireland that provides Ireland with additional monkfish which is a targeted fishery and very important for part of the Irish fleet. This swop was discussed in advance with the POs, at the QMAC meetings on 7 January and 21 February 2014. The FIF fully supported the swop, while the IS&amp;amp;EFO expressed concerns. Taking into account the views expressed, the Department completed the swop. It is expected that a proposal for a similar swop will be under consideration again this year.</p></reply>

Both my Department and I are very strongly committed to promoting Farm Safety in collaboration with the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the organisation with primary responsibility for securing health and safety at work.  Farm safety is one of the most critical issues facing farming today.  Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  There were 30 people killed in farm accidents in 2014, which is the greatest number of fatal accidents since 1992.  This was over half of all the workplace deaths in Ireland, making farming the most dangerous occupation in the country.  It is also clear that the most vulnerable people to have accidents and injury in the farming sector are the old and the young, with 5 people under 18 having died in farm accidents and a further 10 who were over 65.</p><p>  My Department has taken a number of steps over the last 12 months and over recent years in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the dangers of working in this industry.</p><p>  Most recently, I launched a new Farm Safety Scheme for the grant-aiding of items relating to farm safety.  I have committed funding of &euro;12.2 million to the scheme which covers items such as animal handling facilities, safety agitation points for slurry tanks and safety cages under translucent roof sheets, to name but a few of the items being supported.  This scheme will see a significant investment in farm safety on farms in the coming months.</p><p>  Research has shown that there is a high level of awareness amongst farmers of health and safety issues and that a focus should now be placed on changing behaviours.</p><p>  My focus at present is to encourage changes in farmers&rsquo; behaviour through positive supports and further education.  It is important that we all support a change in approach to safety on our farms.</p></reply>

In order to clarify the position regarding the areas deemed ineligible my Department undertook a ground verification check, which was carried out on 30th January 2014.  This check confirmed the 2013 area over-declaration as 51.32% in the case of both the Single Farm Payment and the Disadvantaged Area Schemes.  As this over-claim exceeds 20% of the newly established eligible area in respect of both schemes, no payment is due to the person named under the 2013 Single Payment and Disadvantaged Area Schemes.  The person named had received payments of &euro; 5,194.26 on 16/10/2013 and &euro;4,487.38 on 02/12/2013 under the 2013 Single Farm Payment Scheme and a payment of &euro;2,879.70 under the 2013 Disadvantaged Area Based Scheme, which are deemed overpaid.  These amounts must be recouped before any further payments can issue.</p><p>  A letter detailing the outcome of the ground verification check was issued to the person named on 10th June 2014, which also advised that if the number of hectares of eligible land found was insufficient to meet the number of his Single Payment entitlements, his Single Payment would be reduced accordingly.  This letter also advised the person named that any reduction in his claimed area and/or the application of a penalty under the Single Payment Scheme may also have implications for other area based schemes for which he is an applicant, for example, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.</p><p>  In the event that the person named was dissatisfied with the outcome of the ground verification check the decision could be appealed to the independent LPIS Appeals Committee, within 3 months of the notification letter.  To date no such appeal has been received.</p></reply>

Under the Terms and Conditions of the Single Farm Payment /Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; Schemes, an applicant as well as meeting the Scheme criteria is required to comply with EU regulatory requirements relating to Cross Compliance.  The Department&rsquo;s records indicate that in 2013, the amount of nitrogen from livestock manure applied to land on the holding of the person named above, (including that deposited by animals), was 323 kgs per hectare, which exceeded the limit of 250 kgs per hectare set down in the Nitrates Regulations for farmers with an approved derogation.<br/><br/>As similar breaches under the Nitrates Regulations had been identified within the previous three years, the regulatory provisions required that the rules on repetition be applied and this resulted in a final penalty of 100% being applied against the 2013 Direct Schemes payments. <br/><br/>The person named was notified of this decision on 14 October 2014.  The person named has appealed this decision to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and the appeal is currently being examined.  The person named will be notified of the outcome of the appeal on completion of the appeal process.  In the event that the person named considers that they have been treated unfairly by the Appeals Office they can raise the matter with the Office of the Ombudsman.<br/><br/>The person named was the subject of a Nitrates inspection on 3 April 2014, carried out by my Department on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  This inspection identified non-compliance with the cross compliance requirements under the Nitrates Regulations relating to no eve chutes being erected on sheds leading to soiled water mixing with clean water and the inadequate collection of soiled water and slurry from open yards<b>.</b>As similar breaches under the Nitrates Regulations had been identified within the previous three years, the regulatory provisions required that the rules on repetition be applied and this resulted in a penalty of 15% being applied against the 2014 Direct Schemes payments.<br/><br/>This inspection also identified non-compliance with the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) requirements relating to poaching due to cattle being out-wintered, resulting in a penalty of 3% being applied against the 2014 Direct Schemes payments.  The overall penalty applied in respect of 2014 schemes was maximised at 15%.<br/><br/>The person named was notified of these decisions on 24 April 2014.  The person named was also informed of the right to seek a review of this decision however no request for a review has been received by my Department to date.<br/><br/>EU Regulations governing payments under the Single Farm Payment and Disadvantaged Areas Schemes require that where overpayments are identified in respect of a scheme year for which payments have already issued, the over-payments must be recouped from any future year&rsquo;s payments due to the applicant.  In this case the 2013 overpayment under the Single Payment Scheme was deducted from the 2014 payment due to the person named under this scheme, resulting in no payment issuing in respect of 2014.  While the processing of the payment under the 2014 Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; Scheme has not yet been finalised the overpayment under the 2013 Scheme will be recouped from any payment due under the 2014 scheme.</p></reply>

Questions of price are ultimately matters to be determined between individual purchasers and the sellers of cattle.  Nevertheless, I am pleased to note that beef prices have improved considerably in recent weeks.  Prices for R3 steers in Ireland have risen on average by 36 cents per kilo since the beginning of September.  This is an increase of over 10% during this period and beef prices are now ahead of the price received this time last year.  Furthermore, Irish prices are at 10 3% of the EU average price.  As regards the coming year, the forecast is for some slight improvement in Irish cattle prices in 2015 as a result of tighter Irish cattle supplies and a shift in the UK beef supply and use balance. Irish calf and weanling prices should also increase in line with the movement in beef prices.</p><p>  As the Deputy notes, there was agreement between stakeholders on a range of outcomes at the most recent meeting of the Beef Roundtable in November.  This agreement addresses a range of the issues raised by farmers in recent months, including as regards bull beef and quality assurance.  The roundtable has committed to monitoring the implementation of the agreement reached and I will continue to impress on all stakeholders their obligations in this regard.</p></reply>

At recent meetings with the E.U. Commission it was made clear that it is incumbent on Member States to ensure that payments are for actions above the baseline and that clear evidence of same must be shown in order to secure approval for the Rural Development Programme.  There has been extensive consultation with the stakeholders concerned and I am well aware of the issues arising.  However, there is general agreement amongst all that the key to managing these valuable habitats is a single Commonage Management Plan (CMP), covering all participating GLAS shareholders. </p><p>  I have recently met with various hill-farmer representatives and I am very confident that we can deliver a successful implementation strategy for these commonages.  My focus now is to secure Commission approval to the Rural Development Programme at the earliest possible date so that I can open GLAS to applications, and agreement by all stakeholders on the way forward in terms of commonages is crucial in this regard.</p></reply>

Under the requirements of these Regulations, payment can only be made on eligible land.  Farmers are required to ensure that ineligible areas (scrub etc.) and features (rivers, lakes, houses, quarries, etc.) are excluded from the areas they declare for payment.  This was not a new requirement implemented for the first time in 2013.  Each year all applicants are provided with colour maps of the land parcels they declared in their application under the previous year&rsquo;s schemes.  All of the ineligible features that were established during previous on-the-spot inspections or were brought to the attention of my Department by the applicants, as they have always been required to do, were excluded by means of red-lining and other methods &ndash; e.g. splitting of land parcels.

The Commission services notified us of their detailed observations on the draft Programme at the end of October last year, to which my Department provided immediate and detailed replies.  Since then, bilateral discussions have been ongoing with the Commission, with the objective of securing approval for the Irish Programme at the earliest possible date.  Once approval is granted, my Department will move to complete the scheme Terms and Conditions for GLAS and will open the Scheme for applications.  I anticipate that between 25,000 and 30,000 farmers will be approved for entry to GLAS this year and, as the regulations require that all applications be administratively checked before any application is approved, it will take some time to process applications.  This work will be prioritised with a view to having it completed as quickly as possible.  As with the introduction of previous agri-environmental schemes, payment in the first year of application (2015) will be on a part-year basis, followed by annual payments for a further five full calendar years.  I have included a sum of &euro;20m in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2015 to cover expenditure on GLAS this year.</p></reply>

To this end, my Department recognises the important role that the land use sector plays in mitigating greenhouse gases and is strongly committed to providing funding for targeted research in the area of carbon sequestration. Since 2010, my Department has provided more than &euro;4.9 million towards on-going research into the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural and forest lands. A list of these projects, and completed projects, is provided in Appendix.The beneficiaries of research awards &ndash; including Teagasc and Irish Third Level institutions &ndash; are examining the effects of differing agricultural and silvicultural practices on soil organic carbon stocks. In addition, other projects are examining the effects of land use change and tillage management on carbon sink activity.<br/><br/>One of the larger projects my Department has funded is &lsquo;Gaseous Emissions and Land Use Network &ndash; GHG Ireland&rsquo;. This network aims to bring together, in a four year initiative, all principal investigators working in the field of agricultural climate change research. The main focus of the network is to improve our understanding of carbon stock changes in agricultural soils so that we can contribute to the development of a more robust inventory, and underpin future accounting for these categories. My Department has also funded a project on the management of soil organic carbon in Irish agricultural systems.<br/><br/>In addition, my Department has funded a number of research projects under the CARBiFOR (Carbon Sequestration in Irish Forest Ecosystems) programme in order to improve the estimation and reporting of carbon sequestration in forests in Ireland, including farm forests. Currently this work is being funded by the Department under the CForRep project, which is coordinated by University College Dublin and also involves The University of Limerick and University College Cork.

A number of Irish beef processing establishments which had applied for approval to export to the US were audited. The final report of the audit visit was received at the end of December 2014 and is available on the website of the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). FSIS has confirmed that: &ldquo; Ireland has consistently and effectively implemented a beef slaughter inspection system that satisfies all criteria for equivalence with the FSIS meat inspection system&rdquo;. This equivalence recognition has led to the re-opening of the US market to exports of beef from Ireland. However, before trade can commence a number of technical details remain to be concluded e.g. formally listing plants eligible to export, agreeing a veterinary health certificate covering both animal and public health, the eligibility of certain cuts including trimmings and the level of testing required for some intact cuts.</p><p>  As regards the testing required, it will be the responsibility of the Food Business Operator (FBO) to have the required tests carried out at an approved laboratory of their own choice. I am informed some Irish based private laboratories are in a position to provide such a service to processors. In addition, verification samples will be taken by my officials and will be tested in the Department&rsquo;s laboratory complex in Backweston.</p><p>  In accordance with normal practice, the certification of consignments to the US will be the responsibility of the official veterinarian in charge of the listed establishment.</p><p>  The total US beef market is estimated at 11 million metric tonnes. It is split 60: 40 between foodservice and grocery retail (by volume). Approximately 10% (by volume) is imported, the bulk of which is manufacturing beef. Demand for Irish beef there is expected to be immediate and exceptionally strong. I know that some of the leading Irish beef exporters have had people on the ground in the US for some time now in preparation for this announcement and the y are reporting huge opportunities for Irish companies when the trade does commence. Bord Bia has identified the primary target for US market entry as white tablecloth restaurants in key culinary centres such as New York City, Boston and Washington DC, followed by listings in premium grocery retailers initially in the North Eastern states. With record beef prices currently prevailing in the US, opportunities for Irish manufacturing beef are also being explored.</p></reply>

In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery and this has remained the case for many years. </p><p>  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally. I also met with members of the IFA National Pigs and Pigmeat Committee recently to hear their views on developments.</p><p>  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure in recent months and the difficulties that this is causing for producers. Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices remain above the EU average at present. However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.</p><p>  In relation to the Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market. At EU level the Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution. At recent Council meetings I have joined with other Ministers in requesting the European Commission to continue to monitor the developments on markets and called for the introduction of private storage aid. This request did not, however, have the support of a qualified majority of Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledged the significant decline in pig prices and will keep the situation under review. I am committed, however, to continuing to work with liked minded Ministers.   </p><p>  Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways. Firstly I have included provision in 2015 and throughout the whole RDP for an on-farm capital investments scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;37 million allocated for 2015. Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers. Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector. </p><p>  Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level. Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc will support Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The programme has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards. This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pig meat.</p><p>  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pig meat in domestic and overseas markets. Bord Bia provides assistance to the pig meat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pig meat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pig meat on the domestic market and helps expand its presence on EU and third country markets. Indeed from now until 1 February Bord Bia are running a detailed targeted Pork promotional campaign to assist the industry. Further campaigns are planned over the coming months to promote ham and bacon.</p><p>  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors. Indeed it is a key element of my strategy to seek new market opportunities. In that regard I was pleased to announce in recent months the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.</p></reply>

My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is engaged in a comprehensive programme of gathering the necessary baseline data appropriate to the Conservation Objectives of &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas. This data collection programme is substantially complete. This is followed by data analysis and the setting of appropriate Conservation Objectives by the NPWS. Once this process is complete all new, renewal and review aquaculture applications can be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.</p><p>  The Appropriate Assessment of Castlemaine Harbour has been completed and the relevant licensing determinations have been made based on applications to hand at the time of the assessment.   </p><p>  The specific applications referred to by the Deputy were submitted to my Department subsequent to the carrying out of the Appropriate Assessment process for this harbour. Accordingly, it was not possible to assess these applications against the designated Conservation Objectives for the harbour. </p><p>  The optimum method for appropriately assessing applications by individual operators, who are not included in the initial overall assessment procedure, is under consideration by my Department. The process must comply with best scientific practice and be achieved in a manner which will be acceptable to the national authorities and to the EU Commission. </p><p>In the meantime, the assessment procedures agreed with the EU Commission require Appropriate Assessments in respect of aquaculture activities to be carried out by the national authorities and unilateral departure from these arrangements is not possible.   </p><p>  Every effort is being made to expedite the conclusion of this matter as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, the importance of this market in terms of its future potential cannot be understated. The obvious preference is for a normalisation of trade relations but these issues cannot be viewed without taking into account the overall political context. Consequently, I and officials in my Department have been engaged in ongoing efforts to rectify the situation.    In October of last year, I met the Russian Ambassador with a view to working bilaterally to resolve some of the technical issues that have disrupted exports of certain agrifood products from Ireland to Russia. Specifically, we discussed ways in which restrictions imposed as a result of audits or animal disease outbreaks in other parts of the EU could be eased. </p><p>  As a follow up to this meeting, the Irish Ambassador to Russia, accompanied by senior officials from my Department met with their Russian counterparts in Moscow in December of last year. During this meeting it was agreed that bilateral meetings should continue with one being held yesterday. </p><p>  It is clear that certain sectors of the agrifood industry are disproportionately impacted by the current trade restrictions. For the Irish pigmeat industry Russia was the second largest export destination prior to the ban. My officials have impressed upon the Russians the importance of this market to the pig sector in Ireland.</p><p>  At EU level the Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution. At recent Council meetings I have joined with other Ministers in requesting the European Commission to continue to monitor the developments on markets called for the introduction of private storage aid. This request did not, however, have the support of a qualified majority of Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledged the significant decline in pig prices and will keep the situation under review. I am committed, however, to continue to working with liked minded Ministers.</p><p>  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors. Indeed it is a key element of my strategy to seek new market opportunities. And in that regard I was pleased to announce in recent months the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.</p><p>  My Department will maintain an ongoing assessment of the situation,   and continue to engage at EU level and with the Russian authorities regarding this and all other agri-trade matters.</p></reply>

However, the provisions of the Act have historically generally only been applied to agricultural land and the resulting impact on farming, rather than to weeds predominantly found in non-farming land such as river banks, Special Areas of Conservation etc. <br/><br/>Given the nature of penalties to offences applying under SI 477 of 2011, I am satisfied that adequate legislation pertaining to invasive species such as Japanese knotweed is in place without recourse to amending the Noxious Weeds Act 1936.</p></reply>

As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration. <br/><br/>  As Military life places unique physical and psychological demands on individuals it is necessary that its members be physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations and to undertake their duties on deployment overseas<font color="#555555">. I</font>t is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised. As such, in order to maintain the age profile of the PDF to carry out the operational tasks required by Government, it is necessary to have a constant input of recruits into the PDF. The maximum age for personnel who have enlisted in the PDF post 1 January 1994 provides the mechanism through which a satisfactory age profile can be achieved.<br/><br/>While there was significant progress made in recent discussions between PDFORRA and Civil and Military Management on this issue, it was not possible to reach full agreement. As a result, the issue is being referred to third party adjudication for a ruling. It is planned that the adjudication hearing will take place on 30 January 2015, following the exchange of submissions between the parties.<br/><br/>In the meantime work is continuing on exit support measures to support those due to be discharged. A number of military courses and other skills courses are already accredited with various third level institutions and professional bodies. In addition, a comprehensive training course to aid transition to civilian life for these personnel, which involves a skills appraisal and review of a person&rsquo;s service history and training already provided, is currently being piloted. </p></reply>

In a non-binding ruling, the European Committee on Social Rights (ECSR) found that current arrangements for industrial relations in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not in compliance with aspects of the European Social Charter:   </p><p>- Article 5 of the Charter (the right to organise) on grounds of the prohibition against police representative associations from joining national employees&rsquo; organisations;</p><p>- Article 6.2 of the Charter (the right to bargain collectively) on grounds of restricted access of police representative associations to national pay agreement discussions; and</p><p>- Article 6.4 of the Charter on grounds of the prohibition of the right to strike of members of the police force.</p><p>In the light of these ECSR findings, a complaint to the Council of Europe about the lack of union rights for military Representative Associations in Ireland has been now been made by EUROMIL, a European umbrella body for military associations, on behalf of PDFORRA. PDFORRA are similarly claiming most of the same violations of the European Social Charter as AGSI did, including denial of the right to join the ICTU, alleged restricted access to pay talks, and the prohibition on the right to strike.   </p><p>  This is a particularly difficult issue and raises complex questions for Ireland from a legal, operational and management perspective. In this context it is critically important that the Defence Forces are fully operational at all times, and it must be emphasised that the taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military law. These issues will require careful detailed input from all relevant parties. It is only in the full knowledge of all aspects of this issue that full and careful consideration can be given to any proposed change in the present arrangements. </p><p>As the question of the admissibility of the complaint is currently under consideration by the European Committee on Social Rights, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time. </p></reply>

In relation to its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role, the position is that whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they may be asked to provide assistance by the appropriate Lead Department, under the multi-agency Framework, in a wide range of emergency situations which could include disruptive industrial action. At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency.  The capacity of the Defence Forces to provide ATCA support in emergency situations is kept under constant review and plans and procedures are updated as necessary.     </p><p>  Primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to respond to ATCP requests and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to these matters. </p></reply>

In this regard, the level of remuneration in the Defence sector has maintained relativity with the levels available in other related public sector employments. The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2013 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (Haddington Road Agreement) define current pay policy. In the Haddington Road Agreement the Government reaffirmed its commitment that public service pay and any related issues will not be revisited over the lifetime of the Agreement, subject to compliance with the terms of the Agreement. Crucially, there was no cut to the basic pay of any enlisted personnel under the Agreement. Of the measures applying to the Defence Forces in the Haddington Road Agreement, the following may apply to enlisted personnel depending on their duties:<br/><br/>- Incorporation of duties attracting Technical Group 1 pay into standard duties for new enlisted personnel.<br/><br/>- Flat rating Security Duty Allowance and related payments at the standard weekday rate.<br/><br/>- A 10% Reduction in certain Defence Forces Allowances.<br/><br/>- Voluntary buyout of Border Duty Allowance for enlisted personnel.<br/><br/>- Implementation of additional incremental points in pay scales for new enlisted personnel post 01 July 2013.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that a Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for members of the PDF provides a formal mechanism for the PDF Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the Official side. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service. Since 1993, there have been significant developments and improvements in the pay and conditions of military personnel. The Representative Associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them in line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments. <br/><br/>  It is of course open to the Representative Associations of the members of the PDF, subject to the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and the Haddington Road Agreement, to avail of the mechanisms in place should they wish to pursue any particular concerns in relation to the pay and conditions of their members.</p></reply>

A total of 122 submissions were received.<br/><br/>Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are currently considering likely future operational demands and the types of defence capabilities required to meet these demands. In the course of their deliberations, the Working Groups are taking into consideration the matters raised in the submissions. <br/><br/>Discussions have also been held with a range of other Government Departments on cross-cutting policy issues and likely future demands from Government bodies and State agencies. The views of international organisations were also sought with a particular focus on likely future trends in international peace support operations. These discussions are continuing, as required, throughout the preparation of the White Paper.<br/><br/>I have decided to establish an external advisory group to further support me in the production of the White Paper. I have recently approved the terms of reference for this group and appointed Mr. John Minihan to act as chairman. I hope to appoint the remaining members of the group shortly.<br/><br/>I anticipate that the final draft of the White Paper will be submitted to Government for approval by the summer recess. Subject to Government approval, the White Paper on Defence will then be published.  </p></reply>

Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with several United Nations missions.   </p><p>  There are no Irish Defence Forces personnel deployed to the Ukraine.   </p><p>  Defence Forces personnel have been serving with the EU training mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) since March 2013 following Government approval. On 25 February 2014, the Government approved the continued deployment of Defence Forces personnel for service with the training mission. A total of 10 Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with EUTM Mali. Six (6) personnel form part of a joint UK/Irish Infantry Training team while three (3) Irish personnel occupy staff appointments in the Mission Headquarters in Bamako. One officer, of Lieutenant Colonel Rank, is the Deputy Commander of the Training Task Force. </p><p>  The purpose of the mission is to provide military training and advice to the Malian Armed Forces in order to improve their capacity to maintain security in Mali and restore the authority of the Malian Government and the territorial integrity of the Malian State. </p><p>  Currently there are no Irish Defence Forces personnel deployed to Chad. Ireland contributed Defence Forces personnel to the EU led Military Operation in Chad and the Central African Republic (EUFOR Tchad/RCA) from October 2007 to March 2009, and to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) from March 2009 to December 2010. </p></reply>

This programme has brought to fourteen the number of barracks closed during that time. To date the sale has been completed on nine of these barracks - Clancy (Dublin), Castleblaney, Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Monaghan, Cavan, Rockhill(Letterkenny), and a large portion of Longford.  In relation to the remaining barracks, agreement has been reached for the sale of Lifford to Donegal County Council, Castlebar to Mayo County Council and Clonmel to Tipperary County Council. It is expected that these sales will be fully completed shortly.     </p><p>  The remaining part of Longford Barracks has been reserved for sale to the Office of Public Works for the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Magee Barracks in Kildare and Columb Barracks in Mullingar remain the property of the Department of Defence. Approximately eight acres of Magee Barracks has been sold to the Department of Education to facilitate the construction of a new school and it is hoped to auction the remaining portion of the barracks in mid 2015.   </p><p>  Columb Barracks in Mullingar is currently used by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service for training purposes and a large part of the barracks has been licensed to Westmeath GAA Board for use as a potential centre of excellence. As part of the licence agreement, the Board pays a sum to my Department for use of the facility. Discussions are at an advanced stage with the Board in relation to the possible long term lease of the facility. Discussions are also ongoing with a number of other interested parties regarding future use of Mullingar.   </p><p>In addition to the main barracks outlined above a number of other properties have also been identified as surplus to military requirements over recent years. These include, married quarters, Reserve Defence Force (RDF) premises and training lands. A large number of these have already been disposed of whilst others are in the process of being prepared for disposal.   </p><p>  In the case of married quarters which are outside of military installations, the majority were sold to the occupiers/members of the Defence Forces. </p><p>  Over 20 Reserve Defence Force premises have been sold since 1998. Three were sold to local authorities, and one to a State agency with the remaining sold to private individuals. </p><p>A small number of these properties are also being used under licence by various organisations including sporting clubs and in some cases by private individuals for grazing purposes until arrangements are finalised for their disposal. In all cases appropriate rents are being paid to my Department by the licencees. </p></reply>

To this end, a General Service Recruitment competition took place in 2014. Recruitment from the panels established under this competition commenced on 18 August, 2014. Of the 443 Recruits enlisted to the Permanent Defence Force (both Army and Navy) since then, 380 remain in training. There are 37 cadets in training and 15 Apprentice Aircraft Technicians have been recruited to the Air Corps. Targeted General Service recruitment will continue this year from the recruitment panels formed from the 2014 competition. It is planned that these panels will remain in place until they are exhausted later this year.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

A key recommendation in that review was to ensure that all effective members of the Reserve were afforded the opportunity to undertake annual training.  In order to facilitate the nature of Reserve service, training is organised both in and out of normal working hours and at weekends. Reserve training is also organised during academic and traditional holiday periods in order to maximise attendance of Reserve personnel. Reserve personnel also have the opportunity to complete formal courses of training at Brigade and Formation level and in the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh Camp. Training of the Reserve remains a priority of the Defence Forces.   </p><p>  In 2014 members of the Reserve availed of 23,000 paid training man-days. The 2015 budgetary provision for paid training for members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve is &euro;2.068 million.

However, a key impediment in achieving greater female participation is the lack of female applicants relative to males. Recent recruitment campaigns have sought to target potential female candidates and such efforts will continue. <br/><br/>As part of the 2014 recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts were made to increase the number of female applicants. These efforts included school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and the use of social media. At the closing date for the 2014 recruitment campaign there were 749 Female applicants or 10.3% out of a total of 7,303 applicants for the Permanent Defence Force. On the face of it these figures appear to be disappointing. However, I believe that a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers. I am hopeful that through continued engagement and communication, this perception will change over time.</p></reply>

Resulting from the revised strength ceiling, a major re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force was initiated. Key aspects of the reorganisation included the consolidation of three under-strength Army Brigades into two full strength Brigades, the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units. <br/><br/>A major re-organisation of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve was implemented in 2013 and the Reserve Defence Force is now organised alongside the Permanent Defence Force, within a more efficient single force structure.<br/><br/>All of these measures have ensured that the Permanent Defence Force continues to deliver required operational outputs for all approved Aid to the Civil Power and approved Aid to the Civil Authority requests. The Permanent Defence Force also continues to meet Government requirements for overseas peace support operations. The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment is also available for deployments in response to emergencies and crises.<br/><br/>Looking to the future, a new White Paper on Defence is currently being prepared.

The budgetary situation, in the context of the current difficult economic situation, will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and Information Technology Equipment upgrades for the Defence organisation.    The development of a new White Paper on Defence is underway. The White Paper will provide the future policy framework for Defence and Defence provision for the next decade. A key part of the development of the White Paper is the consideration of potential challenges to our defence and security environment that may emerge into the future given that such areas can be volatile and unpredictable. </p><p>  The role of the Air Corps is part of the White Paper deliberations. In addition, the question of proceeding with any replacement aircraft programme for the Air Corps will be considered in tandem with the new White Paper on Defence, the overall equipment requirements of the Defence Forces generally and the funding envelope available in the coming years.   </p><p>  The Air Corps operate a maintenance plan which endeavours to ensure that the maximum number of operational flying hours is available from the current aircraft fleet when most needed. The maintenance of the Air Corps fleet falls into three broad categories: scheduled, unscheduled and routine/daily. The use of Performance Based maintenance contracts assists the Air Corps in keeping downtime of aircraft to the minimum.  </p></reply>

A key part of the development of the White Paper is the consideration of potential challenges to our defence and security environment that may emerge into the future given that such areas can be volatile and unpredictable. The role of the Naval Service and the ongoing Naval Service Ships Replacement Programme are part of the White Paper deliberations.   The Ships Replacement Programme continues to move ahead. Following a tender competition, a contract was placed in October 2010 with Babcock Marine, UK, for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service with the option of a third OPV. The ships are being built in the same dockyard in Devon where both L&Eacute; Roisin and L&Eacute; Niamh were built. </p><p>  The first of the two ships L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett was handed over at the end of April 2014. L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett replaced L&Eacute; Emer which was decommissioned and sold in October 2013. The second ship which will be named L&Eacute; James Joyce is scheduled for delivery in March 2015 at which stage it will replace L&Eacute; Aoife, due for decommissioning shortly. </p><p>  In June 2014, the Department of Defence exercised the option under the original contract to place an order for a third OPV which is scheduled for delivery in the middle of 2016.</p><p>  The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair, will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained.</p></reply>

The Curragh provides a working environment for three main users, the Defence Forces, the horse-racing and training industry and sheep owners. In addition in recent years there has also been a marked increase in the level of use as a leisure facility mainly because of the population growth in the area.  Officials from my Department have regular contact with the various parties involved in the use and management of the Curragh to discuss a wide range of issues including the development and protection of the Curragh plains and how best to deal with the day to day issues of illegal parking, dumping etc.   </p><p>  Also as part of the on-going management of the Curragh my Department officials liaise with various Departments and State Agencies including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the Chief State Solicitors Office to ensure that best practice is adhered to in relation to the development and up keep of the Curragh Plains. </p><p>  In relation to the Curragh of Kildare Bill, as you are aware a number of technical issues arose which caused difficulty in progressing the Bill. Also the establishment of the Authority as a separate agency under the aegis of the Department of Defence (as proposed in the Bill) would involve additional costs in terms of staff, accommodation, expenses and payments to members of the Authority, which would be significantly greater than the costs incurred by my Department in administering the Curragh Lands. This Government has targeted the rationalisation of State agencies as a key cost saving measure and in that context it would be inappropriate to establish a separate agency to manage work currently being done by my Department. Given the requirements of administrative efficiency, and the technical difficulties with the Bill I do not consider it prudent to reactivate the Bill.   </p></reply>

Consequently there is no necessity for a public consultation process.<br/><br/>The need to commence Part 3 of the 2008 Act arises from the changes brought about to the structure of the EU as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon.  In accordance with that Treaty, instruments providing for co-operation in police and criminal justice matters have to be implemented within 5 years of the Treaty coming into effect, that is by 1 December 2014.  Furthermore, these measures, including the EU Convention, have been brought within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice from 1 December 2014.  In order to accede to the Convention, all parts of the 2008 Act had to be brought into force.  Therefore, had Ireland not commenced Part 3 by 1 December, it risked infringement proceedings and potential fines.<br/><br/>The 2008 Act gives effect to the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.  It applies only to mutual assistance in relation to criminal matters and is the basis for Ireland's mutual legal assistance arrangements with other EU member states.  <br/><br/>Part 3 of the Act deals with mutual assistance cooperation in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions where the lawful interception of communications is considered necessary and appropriate. It does not provide for any form of mass surveillance or data gathering.  What it means in practice is where a lawful interception order is in place in one EU state for the investigation of serious crime, a request can be made in another state for assistance in facilitating interception. However, giving effect to that request may only be done if it is  in accordance with the domestic law of the State.  The provisions of the 2008 Act are also reciprocal so the Garda&iacute; can request this type of assistance from other EU member states. Given the sometimes international nature of serious crime, this will further enhance the capabilities of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to deal with it.<br/><br/>In Ireland the domestic law is the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  Again, this Act does not permit or facilitate any form of mass surveillance. Under the Act, interception of communications can only occur following the satisfying of specific conditions. One of these is that an investigation must be underway into a serious criminal offence before an interception warrant can be granted by the Minister for Justice and Equality.<br/><br/>Furthermore the Act<i></i>is overseen by a designated Judge of the High Court and also provides for a Complaints Referee to whom anyone who feels they have been the victim of an abuse of the legislation may refer their case.<br/><br/>Finally, there has been media comment about the provision in Part 3 of the 2008 Act for <i>in </i>camera Court hearings for a failure by a company to comply with directions issued by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources under the 1983 Postal and Telecommunications Services Act. I wish to be quite clear. The provision arises because, obviously, it would not be appropriate in <i>open</i>Court to disclose sensitive information concerning authorisations for interception in the investigation of a serious crime.</p></reply>

It commenced D&aacute;il Report Stage on 11th July 2014 which is to resume in the coming weeks. It is my intention that the Bill be enacted so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority come into operation during the first half of 2015.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>It is regrettable that the item to which the Deputy refers dates from an early 2012 edition of the Solicitors Gazette and is an initial iteration of the Law Society, as but one stake-holder, in response to the Bill's publication. The document is three years out of date at this stage and consequently does not reflect the subsequent development and enhancement of the Bill before the House. As the Deputy has confirmed in forming her Question, such views, like those of many other stake-holders in the Bill, are already in the public domain. They have also  been the subject of firm responses in support of Government policy by myself and my predecessor which are also a matter of public record - indeed my Department held a public conference in support of the Bill's reforms in July 2012. The Deputy will also have witnessed a number of these responses first hand in the debate of the Bill during D&aacute;il Report and Committee Stages and at the opening session of D&aacute;il Report Stage. By the same token, she will be aware of the various enhancements that have been made to the Bill in the course of those proceedings. Moreover, having been a key deliverable under the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Programme, the Bill and its structural reforms are now the subject of a Country Specific Recommendation under the EU Semester Process.<br/><br/>The Bill has an array of measures which continue to support both the public interest and public confidence. It continues to provide for a new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority with a lay majority and a lay Chair. The Authority will have responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers and will be independent in its functions and in its appointment by nominating bodies. There will now be an independent complaints framework to deal with public complaints directly instead of through the professional bodies as happens at present. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions. There will be a new, transparent and much more consumer-focussed legal costs regime augmented by an enhanced legal costs determination procedure under the aegis of a new Legal Costs Adjudicator whose findings will be publicly accessible. Moreover, the Bill continues to make provision for alternative business models for the provision of legal services, including in tandem with non-legal service providers, by way of increasing competition and choice in the legal services market and I will be bringing forward further amendments to these new business provisions for the resumption of D&aacute;il Report Stage.<br/><br/>It is clear from these developments and from the Regulatory Impact Analysis published by my Department that the Bill is not, as the Deputy would seem to insinuate, the property of any single stake-holder. Rather, it represents a more modern balancing of the interests of consumers of legal services with those which would have traditionally applied from a narrower professional perspective.  Among the more directly interested parties are the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association and the Honorable Society of King's Inns. I  continue to receive submissions from these as I do from other stake-holders who similarly have specific observations to make on the detail of the Bill. Over the past three years, my predecessor and I, and  departmental officials, have had various meetings with  interested groups and bodies. Alongside the legal professional bodies, these have included the Competition Authority, the Consumers' Association and the Committee of Heads of Irish University Law Schools all of whose views have been publicly iterated and are readily accessible on the internet. Over ninety written submissions have been received since the publication of the Bill, representing over thirty-six interested parties, along with dozens of individual letters from concerned members of the public as well as the formal observations of other Government Departments who support the Bill's structural reforms. <br/><br/>Submissions have, therefore, come from a wide range of bodies beyond those representing the legal professions including academics, civil liberty and human rights organisations, private businesses and the affected clients of legal practitioners. I continue to encourage, receive and consider such submissions and views on the Bill and I look forward to the Deputy's ongoing contribution in this regard.  I also look forward to the coming enactment of the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014 which, having just  completed D&aacute;il Committee Stage under the stewardship of my Cabinet colleague, Minister Brendan Howlin, is commencing D&aacute;il Report Stage this week.  These lobbying measures will  be a further and welcome embellishment of the parliamentary process. </p></reply>

Such information will only be included in a vetting disclosure if the non-conviction information gives rise to a bona fide belief that the person would pose a threat to a child or vulnerable person. Most non-convictions relate to minor offences such as motoring or public order offences. However in a small number of cases non-convictions arise in cases of assault or sexual offences where for a variety of reasons the person is not prosecuted or convicted. </p><p>  The 2012 Act provides certain important safeguards where disclosure of a non-conviction is proposed. The information that is to be disclosed must be provided to the vetting applicant and they must be given the opportunity to appeal the proposed decision to disclose the information to an independent Appeals Officer. The person can also ultimately appeal a decision by an Appeals Officer on a point of law to the High Court.</p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 has not yet been commenced. This is because a 2013 UK Court of Appeal judgment necessitated a review of the disclosure provisions in both the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Spent Convictions Bill.  That review has been completed and amendments to the Vetting Act and consequential amendments to the Spent Convictions Bill are currently being drafted.  The 2012 Act will then be commenced at the earliest opportunity. Pending the amendment of the Act, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures has been introduced, which provides that certain minor offences that are over 7 years old are no longer disclosed.</p></reply>

Once the Bill is enacted, the 1871 Act will no longer provide a legal basis for assessment of a person&rsquo;s decision-making capacity.  Instead, the Bill provides for any person who has been made a ward of court under the 1871 legislation to have her or his case reviewed by the court.  Following review, the person will be discharged from wardship.  Where the person is found by the court to lack decision-making capacity, the possibility will be available of having a decision-making representative appointed to take decisions on the person's behalf but who will have to take account of the person's will and preferences, where possible.   </p><p>  The Department has been advised that providing for the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 to cease to have effect will achieve the aim of ensuring that wardship is abolished for existing wards and for the future. However, as I finalise the necessary amendments for Committee Stage of the Bill, due shortly, I will also consider, in conjunction with the Attorney General's Office, whether particular provision can be made for unequivocal repeal of the 1871 Act.</p></reply>

Responsibility for coordinating policy on disability lies with my Department.  However, the implementation of sectoral policy is a matter for a number of Government Departments, with responsibility for provision of services resting mainly with the Department of Health. <br/><br/>In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government a National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan (NDSIP) was published in July 2013 following significant consultation and consideration between relevant Government Departments, representatives of a broad range of disability organisations and persons with a lived experience of disability. The Plan sets out the practical measures that will be taken to advance the National Disability Strategy over the period 2013 to 2015 and ensures that available resources are used to best effect to meet the needs of all people with disabilities, including those with intellectual disabilities. The issues raised in the correspondence referred to by the Deputy are all included in this Plan. <br/><br/>Progress on the Implementation Plan is reviewed by the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) through thematic meetings which deal with specific issues.  Such meetings are attended by all relevant bodies to ensure cross-sectoral input and review.

I published the Inspector's report on 17 December, 2014.  </p><p>  I would like to begin by taking this opportunity to offer my sympathy to the family concerned on their loss.  I would also like to thank the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, for his very comprehensive investigation and report into the death in custody of the prisoner concerned.  </p><p>  Since 1 January, 2012, the death of any prisoner in custody or on temporary release is the subject of an independent investigation by the Inspector of Prisons.  The Office of the Inspector is a statutory independent office established under the Prisons Act, 2007.  </p><p>  The Inspector's investigation and reports are part of a three pronged process, the other elements being investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and investigations and inquests conducted by Coroners.  The combination of the Garda inquiries, the Coroners&rsquo; investigations and inquests, and the Inspector&rsquo;s reports mean that this country is in compliance with its national and international obligations and meets the criteria laid down by the European Court of Human Rights when interpreting the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. </p><p>  It is important for all concerned, where any issues or deficiencies arise, that we ensure they are addressed and that we learn from them.  In that context, I am carefully studying the Inspector's report and am considering the issues involved.</p><p>  These include the issue of temporary release for the category of offenders referred to in the report, which is currently considered on a case-by-case basis. Proposals are under consideration for a more structured approach of limited temporary release in such cases, where full and constructive engagement with the prison and probation services could lessen the risk of re-offending.</p><p>  In this consideration, the safety of the public, the importance of victims, and the goal of reducing re-offending will be the primary objectives.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of Garda submissions on applications for temporary release, it is important, given the crucial role that Garda advice can have in the consideration of such applications, that this issue is addressed generally, and not simply in relation to any individual case. The Irish Prison Service is therefore being asked to engage with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on agreeing a more structured format for the submission of advice on such applications, drawing on the findings of this report and their joint experience in managing this issue.</p></reply>

One of the key requirements of the UN Convention is that persons with capacity difficulties should be enabled to exercise decision-making autonomy.  Consequently, the starting point in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill is one of enabling persons with capacity difficulties to take their own decisions to the greatest extent possible.  Where they are unable to take decisions themselves, the Bill provides for a series of decision-making supports.  However, the priority remains one of ensuring that the person's will and preferences are respected as far as possible.</p><p>  I recognise the fundamental and critical role of parents, and other relatives and siblings in relation to the day-to-day lives of many people who need assistance in exercising their legal capacity. The focus of the Bill is on enabling persons to make their own decisions, including choosing whom they wish to support them in the decision-making process. However, w  here persons with capacity difficulties are unable to take decisions themselves, it is likely that, in many cases, family members will be centrally involved in the decision-making support options available under the Bill.   Under the co-decision-making option in particular, where decisions are made jointly by the person with capacity difficulties and by the co-decision-maker, it is anticipated that the co-decision-maker will often be a family member as it is a requirement of this support option that the co-decision-maker should know the person and understand his or her will and preferences.  It will also be possible for a family member to apply to the court to be appointed as a decision-making representative for a person with capacity difficulties where that person lacks decision-making capacity. </p><p>  The Bill, when enacted, is intended to be of direct assistance in setting out guiding principles and levels of intervention which should be of considerable help to persons and their supportive families. In addition, the Office of the Public Guardian which will be set up under the Bill, will be able to provide advice and support to persons with capacity difficulties and families who help them.</p><p>  I intend to propose a range of amendments to the Bill at its forthcoming Committee Stage to strengthen the safeguards in the Bill aimed at respecting the person's autonomy, dignity and bodily integrity.  These amendments should address some of the other concerns raised by the Deputy. The Bill is expected to go through Committee Stage in the current session</p></reply>

However, these powers are exercised in circumstances where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reasonably suspects that an offence has occurred.  These powers can only be used, therefore, where a Garda has a reasonable suspicion supported by some evidence.  The mere assertion of wrongdoing by a member of the general public is clearly insufficient in this regard.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has investigated a range of complaints of alleged unlawful activity at Shannon Airport and, where appropriate, files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In all these cases, no further action was found to be warranted, owing to a lack of any evidence of unlawful activity.<br/><br/>Any person with credible information that Irish airports have been used for any alleged unlawful purpose should report their concerns to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The report of the task force was published on 2 September 2014. A dedicated website has been put in place outlining a range of options open to non-EEA students affected by the closure of private sector colleges and in that regard I am informed that arrangements for non-EEA students affected by the closure of Leinster College will be available on that website at www.studenttaskforce.ie by the end of this week.</p><p>  The recent experience surrounding the closure of various colleges, most recently Shelbourne College, and the widespread immigration abuses that have been seen throughout the sector, clearly illustrates that the status quo with respect to the regulation of Colleges accepting non-EEA national students is untenable and cannot be allowed to continue.  If the State is to grant immigration permission to non-EEA nationals to live, study and work in Ireland then it must be able to regulate the institutions which they attend and it must have confidence in the quality of education services that are being delivered. In that regard it is important that bona fide students can have confidence that providers will deliver to them the courses for which they have paid.  </p><p>  I am fully committed to delivering on the government's  regulatory reforms programme in this area as announced in September 2014 in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills.   Ireland's reputation as a high quality destination for international students is at risk and  I am committed with my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure that that reputation is protected. </p></reply>

Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 October 2011.<br/><br/><i>Legal Aid Custody Issues Scheme </i><br/><br/>This Scheme provides payment for legal representation in the High Court and the Supreme Court for certain types of cases not covered by civil legal aid or the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme namely (i) Habeas Corpus Applications, (ii) Supreme Court Bail Motions, (iii) Judicial Reviews, (iv) Extradition Applications and European Arrest Warrants and (v) High Court Bail Motions.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 June 2012. <br/><br/><i>Criminal Assets Bureau Legal Aid Scheme</i><br/><br/>The Scheme is applicable to persons who are respondents and/or defendants in any court proceedings brought by, or in the name of, the Criminal Assets Bureau including court proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the Revenue Acts or the Social Welfare Acts and applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 January 2014.<br/><br/><sup><font color="#000080"> </font></sup>It is proposed that the administration of the main Criminal Legal Aid Scheme will be transferred to the Legal Aid Board on foot of new legislation which is currently being drafted.  This move will be in keeping with the international model for the delivery of legal aid and advice services and will achieve a more dedicated focus to the management and delivery of Criminal Legal Aid.  It would be premature at present to commit to a date for the transfer of the scheme. <br/><br/><i>Family Mediation Service</i><br/><br/><sup></sup>In addition, the Board took on responsibility for the Family Mediation Service in November 2011 which had been under the auspices of the Family Support Agency up to that point. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. There are very positive signs which include the initiative set up in 2011 operating from the District Court in Dolphin House involving a co-location of the Courts with a family mediation service and a law centre. This has proved very successful and was put on a permanent footing in 2014. Similar initiatives are now operating from Cork, Naas, Limerick, Clonmel and Nenagh. Integration of the Family Mediation Service into the Legal Aid Board has also meant an increase in the referrals from Law Centres to mediation in appropriate cases.<br/><br/><b>Merger of the Property Registration Authority, Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland</b><br/><br/>The merger of the Property Registration Authority, Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland has been mandated by the Government under the Agency Rationalisation Programme. A Project Board, comprising senior representatives of the three Departments concerned along with the Chief Executive Officers of the three Agencies, is overseeing the merger. The CEO Designate of the merged body which is to be named Tailte &Eacute;ireann, was appointed from 1 July 2013. It is anticipated that Ministerial responsibility for the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland will be transferred to the Minister for Justice and Equality in due course. I can also advise that the General Scheme of a Bill will be brought to Government in early 2015.<br/><br/><b>Dissolution of the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests</b><br/><br/>The Charities Regulatory Authority, which is an independent regulatory body for the charities sector, was established on 16 October 2014, under the Charities Act 2009.  This Act also provided for the dissolution of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests and the consequential transfer of their statutory functions to the new Authority.  As the work of the former Commissioners, which related to supporting the trustees of charities in carrying out their functions in accordance with the Charities Acts 1961 and 1973 will continue under the new Authority, there have been no savings or staffing reductions arising from this change.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><br/><br/><b>Dissolution of the International Commission on Decommissioning</b><br/><br/>The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) was responsible for overseeing the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.  It was established by an agreement between the Irish and British Governments, signed on 26 August 1997, and by legislation enacted in the two jurisdictions.  It was dissolved on 31 March 2011. The outturn for the Commission's last full year of operation 2010 was &euro;594,000.<br/><br/><b>Dissolution of the Independent Monitoring Commission</b><br/><br/>The Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) was responsible for monitoring and reporting on paramilitary activity across Ireland and also for monitoring the security normalisation measures undertaken by the British Government in Northern Ireland.  It was dissolved on 31 March 2011. The outturn for the Commission's last full year of operation 2010 was &euro;426,000.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><br/><br/><b>Merger of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority</b><br/><br/>The Human Rights Commission and Equality Authority have been merged to establish a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014  was signed into law by the President on the 27 July 2014. The IHREC was established on 1 <sup></sup>November 2014. <br/><br/>The administrative savings anticipated as a consequence of the merger - estimated at some &euro;500,000 - have been retained by agreement by IHREC to support its core work.  In addition, the approved budget for the IHREC for 2014 was &euro;6,299,000 which represented a &euro;2m increase approximately on the 2013 allocation, with an interim staff complement of 47, to ensure the new Commission has adequate resources to meet its mandate and is well placed to be successful in its forthcoming application to the UN to obtain re-accreditation as Ireland&rsquo;s recognised National Human Rights Institution.<br/><br/><b>Equality Tribunal</b><br/><br/>The Equality Tribunal now falls under the aegis of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with effect 1<sup></sup>January 2013 and will become part of the new Workplace Relations Commission once established.  The Commission will also include the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the National Employment Rights Authority.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><br/><br/><b>Abolition of the Prisons Authority Interim Board</b><br/><br/>The Prisons Authority Interim Board was abolished on 26 July 2011. The amount saved was in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b><br/><br/><b>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board</b><br/><br/>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board has been operating for some time with reduced staff and now that all of the cases involving the Board have concluded, arrangements are being made to dissolve the Board.</p></reply>

The length of time applicants spend in the protection process is a matter to be addressed and you will be aware that an independent Working Group was set up by Government in October 2014 to report on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers. One of the tasks of the Working Group is to identify improvements to existing arrangements for the processing of protection applications taking account of the Government's intention to legislate for a single application procedure. The Group began its work in November last under the Chairmanship of retired High Court Judge, Bryan McMahon. A number of NGO's active in the asylum area, including the Irish Refugee Council, are represented on the Working Group. </p><p>  The Working Group is due to report to Government with its recommendations by Easter 2015 and I think it is important that the Working Group be allowed to continue its work without pre-empting the outcomes at this stage. I will consider whatever recommendations are put forward by it, including in relation to the processing of protection cases on hand, when it completes its work.   </p><p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that there are a number of initiatives already in place to address the number of cases in the protection system which are yielding significant results. The transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in late 2013 has resulted in decisions in some 825 cases at first instance by the end of 2014. The processing of these cases has been greatly aided by the establishment of a legal panel set up to assist the Commissioner with this work. It is now proposed to extend the use of that panel to the processing of asylum applications. I have also recently decided to appoint an additional nine members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to assist with the processing of asylum and subsidiary protection appeals on hand. These members have been selected from those who were considered suitable for appointment following a competitive process involving the Public Appointments Service.  My Department is also actively considering what other measures can be taken to reduce the number of cases on hand at the leave to remain stage of the process in advance of the introduction of a single application procedure.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that there is a political commitment among EU Member States against any form of process that would grant residence status to persons present in the state without first examining the merits of their individual cases. Broad regularisation programmes are problematic, in particular as they could give rise to unpredictable and very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.</p></reply>

The Court noted that the power conferred by section 3 of the Firearms Act 1925 on Garda Superintendents to grant firearms certificates is one of a wide range of powers in various areas conferred by legislation. In this regard, reference was made to the powers conferred on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Betting Act 1931, the Public Dance Halls Act 1935, the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. <br/><br/>The Court concluded as follows:<br/><br/>&quot;One is entitled to assume that in all such instances the Oireachtas decided that the power should be exercised by a senior garda officer in a particular locality for what seemed to them (the Oireachtas) good reasons, but they would, of course, have been perfectly entitled to confer the power in question on another body, such as a court of local and limited jurisdiction, a local authority or some other state agency.<br/><br/>It follows, in my view, that the learned High Court Judge was correct in holding that the power conferred on garda superintendents by s.2 of the 1925 Act was conferred on him as a <i>persona designata</i>and that, accordingly, it vested in him a discretion which he could not abdicate to anyone else.

It provides a further mechanism for Garda&iacute; to provide crime prevention information to community contacts who in turn forward the information to all members of a community group. This initiative has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 500 local groups involving in excess of 100,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme. I am informed that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. <br/><br/>Community Alert groups are key partners in relation to the the Text Alert scheme and for many years my Department has provided funding for the Community Alert programme, which is operated by  Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda authorities, and supports over 1,300 local groups.  My Department does not provide direct funding to local groups, but funding is provided in relation to the employment and associated costs of the national service, including regional Development Officers. The long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to my Department to support effective community crime prevention actions. I am currently providing the maximum possible funding to Community Alert that is open to me, having regard to the overall restrictions on my Department's resources and other expenditure needs.  I understand that funding for Community Alert is also received from the HSE. <br/><br/>More generally, I am advised that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government supports the Community and Voluntary Sector through a suite of schemes with a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat. A community organisation may qualify for inclusion under one or more of these schemes, should it meet the terms and conditions of a particular scheme managed by the Department.

The general position, however, is that conditions applicable to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor are set out in the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2011. Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is already an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person, including taxi drivers or other individuals, to do so. </p><p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 Report. The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made as part of the transaction in such cases, e.g. on-line shopping, and not later on delivery of the product. The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for on delivery were illegal transactions and recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees. Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the Licensing Acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution. </p><p>  Moreover, under section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), it is an offence for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol to any person for consumption off his or her premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.</p></reply>

Particular criminal groups have been identified as playing a large part in the recent increase and these groups are being targeted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a cohesive way in co-operation with other criminal justice agencies.  A further and related operation, Operation Creeper, assists in the surveillance of Acer targets by monitoring their movements.

I published the draft Order proposing the establishment of this Commission of Investigation on 19 December 2014.  The draft Order includes the terms of reference for the Commission.  All of the matters recommended by Mr Guerin SC for inclusion in a Commission of Investigation are included in the terms of reference. </p><p>  The case referred to by the Deputy is amongst the complaints being considered under the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach, or to other public representatives with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  The review of each complaint will consist of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a counsel from the panel.  Following the review of each complaint a recommendation will be made as to whether any further action is desirable and could practicably be taken.   </p><p>  I would assure the Deputy that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur.  However I would also make the point that, in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken.  This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.</p><p>  Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.</p></reply>

The contractual construction cost is &euro;33,706,391 excluding VAT.  <br/><br/>The current estimate for completing the construction contract is &euro;35.5m (excluding VAT).<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The only significant addition to the original Cork prison construction project is the inclusion of a purpose built recreation block.  <br/><br/>The inclusion of the recreation block was a result of a review of the completed extension to Midlands Prison and detailed consideration of the feedback received from prison management.  The Irish Prison Service (IPS) concluded that an insufficient amount of prisoner recreation space was provided for in the Cork prison plans as originally tendered.  It was agreed that separate Recreation Halls /Areas on each landing were not adequate for the recreational needs of the proposed prisoner population in the new prison in Cork.  <br/><br/>Accordingly, the IPS reviewed the plans for the proposed new Cork Prison in relation to the indoor recreation /amenity space provided for in the exemplar design which had been issued for tender purposes.  An information notice was issued in September 2013 informing all of the shortlisted tenderers of an emerging requirement for the construction of a recreation block during the course of the project.  The bidders were advised that the recreation block would be called up by way of a change order with the cost being determined in accordance with their submitted rates.  <br/><br/>The contract was awarded in December 2013.  The design of the recreation block was developed over a period of several weeks and a final design proposal was recommended to the IPS Capital Projects Oversight Board (CPOB) by the IPS Project Team.  The recommendation of the Project Team, and costs for the construction of the block were approved by the CPOB in March 2014.  As the block was not included in the tender scope of works it has been incorporated into the works by way of a change order.  The cost of the recreation block is &euro;1.63m exclusive of VAT.<br/><br/>No additional planning consent was required as the design of the additional recreation block has been developed to ensure it sits in the approved design with no material impact.  <br/><br/>The successful bidder has fully incorporated the recreation block into their programme and consequently no delay in the completion of the project should occur due to the inclusion of this requirement.  The anticipated duration of the programme is 20 months and the target date for practical completion is July 2015.  <b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p></reply>

The revised scope also includes a plan to incorporate an enhanced outdoor recreation area and yards, including a new Astro turf facility for 5- a-side football, a green area for horticultural activities, and a facility for handball.<br/><br/>The extent of these works were not envisaged at the time of the original consultants tender in 2012. However, provision is made in the Consultancy Tender to facilitate a change in the scheme through the brief development stage. As part of the tender process, tenderers were required to provide specific rates in relation to the project which were applied to changes in scope.<br/><br/>The estimated final payments for the Limerick development projects cannot be accurately estimated at this time as final approval for the project has not yet been granted.

As I indicated in that response, the reason that the General Scheme requires the assisted reproduction treatment to be carried out in a clinical setting is because there is very clear case-law on the situation of a donor father where the treatment takes place outside a clinical setting to the effect that he has all the rights of a father to apply for guardianship and access. The requirement for the treatment to be carried out in a clinical setting will enable the respective rights of a child, a birth mother, a father or second female parent and any donor to be safeguarded as clear procedures can be put in place regarding the consent of the parties to the treatment.</p><p>  As I also pointed out in that response, there are other provisions in the General Scheme which would enable a couple who have had a child through non-clinical assisted reproduction both to have a legal relationship with the child. </p></reply>

This included 136 prisoners who were serving less than 3 months solely for the non-payment of a Court ordered fine and 199 prisoners who were on structured temporary release programmes such as the community return Programme or Community Support Scheme.<br/><br/>The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release are fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.<br/><br/>A prisoner may apply through the prison Governor for consideration for temporary release.  Their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation made by the prison authorities and/or therapeutic services is to that effect.  Each application is considered on its individual merits and a number of factors are taken into account when making a decision on whether to grant temporary release including:<br/><br/>- the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates;<br/><br/>-the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed;<br/><br/>- the period of the sentence served by the person;<br/><br/>- the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released;<br/><br/>- the person's previous criminal record;<br/><br/>- the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release;<br/><br/>- the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release;<br/><br/>- any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Probation &amp;amp; Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release;<br/><br/>- the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release;<br/><br/>- the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release;<br/><br/>- the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment. <br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 and the Joint Prison Service/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2013-2015 includes working towards the objective of ensuring that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.<br/><br/>The Community Return Scheme is an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners, serving sentences between 1 year and 8 years, can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting.  The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.<br/><br/>In addition to Community Return, a community Support Scheme has also been introduced to reduce the current recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release. <br/><br/>Table 1.

There were 15,735 committals to prison in 2013 which was a decrease of 7.6% on the 2012 figure.  The overall daily average number of prisoners in custody has also dropped in recent years.  The average number in custody for 2014 was 3,916 a reduction of 10.8% on the 2011 average of 4,390.<br/><br/>The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23 February 2011. Today there are 973 less prisoners in custody which represents a decrease of 21%.</p></reply>

The ISI releases its statistics on a quarterly basis and the most up to date figures reflecting Quarter 4 of 2014 were published today on their website .  2014 was the ISI&rsquo;s first full year of operation and during that time almost 1000<font color="#FF0000"> </font>debt solutions were approved, comprising 547 alternatives to bankruptcy and 448 bankruptcy cases. <br/><br/>In the case of Debt Relief Notices (DRNs), 100% of applications made were successful.  There is no creditors meeting and no DRNs were rejected by the ISI or the Courts. 85% of Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSAs) were successful and 71% of Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) were successful.<br/><br/>Overall, 75% of DSAs and PIAs were successful.  It is encouraging that three out of four cases are being supported by creditors and the number of PIAs - the solution that deals with mortgage debt and aims to keep the debtor in their home - approved in Q4 increased by 148% over Q3 and also exceeded the previous three quarters combined.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Successful applications 2014</b><table><tr><th>DRN </th><th>DSA</th><th>PIA</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>251</td><td>97</td><td>199</td><td>547</td></tr></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Unsuccessful applications 2014</b><table><tr><th>DRN </th><th>DSA</th><th>PIA</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>18</td><td>81</td><td>99</td></tr></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Successful applications 2013 (September to December)</b><table><tr><th>DRN </th><th>DSA</th><th>PIA</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Unsuccessful applications 2013 (September to December)</b><table><tr><th>DRN </th><th>DSA</th><th>PIA</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><br/><br/>The ISI launched a number of initiatives last autumn through its &lsquo;<i>Back on Track&rsquo; </i>campaign, () including the waiving of application fees until the end of 2015.

The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.<br/><br/>The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to any Division may fluctuate due, for example, to promotion, transfer, retirements and resignations.  However, I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of the Kilkenny/Carlow Garda Division broken down by Station on 31 December 2010 to 2013 and on 30 November 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the table.<br/><br/>With regard to the number of vehicles, responsibility for the efficient deployment of Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances. The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.  In that context I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of cars in the Carlow/Kilkenny Garda Division is set out in the table below:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Carlow/Kilkenny Vehicles 2011 -

Its aim is to enable these persons to exercise decision-making autonomy to the greatest extent possible.  To this end, the Bill provides for the replacement of the adult Wards of Court system with a less intrusive system.  It also offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability.  Its enactment is a key element in enabling Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p><p>  The Bill was published in July 2013, completed second stage in D&aacute;il in December 2013 and is awaiting committee stage in the current session.  As the Bill has already commenced its transit through the Houses of the Oireachtas it will not be republished.  However, amendments to it will become a matter of public record as it passes through each stage of the legislative process. My Department is currently working, in this regard, on amendments to the Bill to align it more closely with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to strengthen the safeguards necessary to enable persons with capacity difficulties to exercise greater autonomy in decision-making. </p></reply>

I published the draft Order proposing the establishment of this Commission of Investigation on 19 December 2014.  The draft Order includes the terms of reference for the Commission.  All of the matters recommended by Mr Guerin SC for inclusion in a Commission of Investigation are included in the terms of reference. <br/><br/>With reference to the independent review by a panel of counsel of certain allegations of Garda misconduct to which the Deputy refers, the panel has been examining over 300 cases.  Its role is effectively to triage those cases with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.  Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The projects may also work with young people who are significantly at risk of becoming involved in anti-social behaviour with a view to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing community relations. </p><p>  Garda personnel levels and deployment are monitored and adjusted according to needs and analysis of crime trends and anti-social activities in the particular area.

The events in Paris last week are a stark illustration of the reality of this situation.</p><p>  However it is important that any response Ireland might make in a national context is proportionate. </p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour. The number of Irish citizens who are believed to have travelled to the conflict zones since the commencement of the Arab Spring is estimated at between 25 and 30. However, within that number are individuals who would have travelled to Libya and other Arab States to take part in the popular uprisings there which began in December 2010.  Others travelled for humanitarian or family reasons.  Nonetheless some are also known to have participated in the various conflicts and at least three have lost their lives. </p><p>  There are also a number of individuals who have returned from the conflict zones and a small number of people based here who support extremism and would try to facilitate it.  The activities of these people are closely monitored by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there is very close cooperation with security services in other jurisdictions.  It would be counterproductive to go into what specific intelligence is available.</p><p>  In line with best practice internationally An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas.  The Garda&iacute; also operate a progressive community relations programme through its Racial Inter-Cultural and Diversity Office. That office is in regular contact with our minority communities and recently received favourable comment on its operation from the UN Counter Terrorism Committee. </p><p>  It is also vital that the State has the necessary legislation in place to address the terrorist threat. In that context  I wish to advise the Deputy that the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all stages in the Seanad.   The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment and are particularly pertinent to the nature of the threat posed by radicalised individuals and indeed those who incite them to commit such heinous acts as those witnessed last week. It is expected that the Bill will go before the D&aacute;il next month and that it will be passed shortly thereafter. </p><p>  In an international context, Ireland has been active on this issue for some time now. Indeed priority was given to the matter during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. In that connection Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of the Member States to carry out a review of the EU Strategy for Countering Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism.  A primary point of focus in this review is the foreign fighter issue. A number of initiatives at EU level have since been developed for member States to combat this phenomenon including community relations initiatives, media campaigns,  enhanced tracking of suspects' movements, engagement with third countries (notably Turkey) and engagement with internet service providers and social media companies to curb radical online content.  </p><p>Within the EU framework the Government has consistently supported the availability of airline Passenger Name Records (PNR) data to law enforcement services, subject to the appropriate safeguards. The proposed EU Directive on PNR is an important measure in the ongoing fight against terrorism and serious crime. While agreeing a PNR Directive has proved a very contentious policy area from the European Parliament&rsquo;s point of view, this Government's strong preference is for an agreed EU framework for PNR and we will continue to work with our colleagues in other EU Member States to reach an agreement on this matter. The sole and shared aim of this Directive is, after all,  to ensure the safety of our citizens  .</p></reply>

The most recent published figures covered the 12 month period to the end of the second quarter of 2014 and indicated that the number of burglary offences were down very slightly on the previous 12 months (down by 0.1%).  While provisional information received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the full year 2014 indicates a largely neutral trend in burglary crime in the Eastern Garda Region (not including the Dublin area), it would be important to await finalised data from the CSO before making  any more definitive comments on the matter. </p><p>  One of my priorities is to maintain and enhance the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to protect the public, and in particular to prevent and detect crime.  It is true that Garda strength has been affected by retirements, and that is why I was pleased to be able to secure approval for the resumption of Garda recruitment.  As the Deputy will be aware, 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014, the first intake of Garda recruits since 2009 . This was followed by an intake of a further 100 new recruits in December.  A further intake of 100 is due to enter training at the end of this month.

The first intake of recruits will attest as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May of this year and will be assigned to Garda Stations by the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>  It is of course a key objective of the Garda Commissioner to allocate all of the resources at her disposal in a manner which maximises their impact on the protection of the public and on the prevention and detection of crime.  In that context, Garda management keep under continuing review developments in relation to security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p><p>  I have however been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Kildare and Meath Garda Divisions on 30 November 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 301 and 281 respectively.

I published the draft Order proposing the establishment of this Commission of Investigation on 19 December 2014.  The draft Order includes the terms of reference for the Commission.  All of the matters recommended by Mr Guerin SC for inclusion in a Commission of Investigation are included in the terms of reference. <br/><br/>The case referred to by the Deputy is amongst the complaints being considered under the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach,  with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  The review of each complaint will consist of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a counsel from the panel.  Following the review of each complaint a recommendation will be made as to whether any further action is desirable and could practicably be taken.  <br/><br/>Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.  <b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p></reply>

Applicants for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable then to pay for legal representation.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.The nature of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is that it is demand led, driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and the prosecution of cases through the courts system. <br/><br/>In seeking to reduce the expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, the rates of fees paid to the legal practitioners were reduced by 8% in March 2009 and by a further 8% in April, 2010. There was also a reduction of 10% in July 2011 in the fees payable in the District Court. Fees payable in the Circuit and higher courts were also decreased by 10% in October 2011 following the reduction in the fees payable by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecution practitioners. A reduction of 50% was also applied to payments in respect of adjourned sentence hearings and travel and subsistence payments from 2011. As the Deputy will see from the figures above, following these and other measures introduced in the course of 2011, a 10% reduction in expenditure was recorded in 2012 compared with 2011. This was the first substantial reduction ever recorded under this Scheme. Expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is monitored on an ongoing basis with a view to identifying any areas where further efficiencies may be achieved.  <br/><br/>I can inform the Deputy that a new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is currently being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Legislative provisions under consideration include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, enable the Board to verify the means of applicants and to provide for prosecution of cases of abuse.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

In this regard the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Under this model there is a community policing team in each District, headed up by a Sergeant.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  Within this framework, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle local crime issues including public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities and business groups, including the hospitality industry, to reduce crime and enhance community safety.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour and related criminality.</p><p>  Particular developments in recent years includes the national &lsquo;Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign&rsquo; which reaffirms the community policing ethos through the hosting of various local activities and as part of which Garda&iacute; give important Crime Prevention and Road Safety Advice.  In addition, new Garda Community Crime Prevention Guidelines, which build on the work of existing partnership programmes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, were published in January 2013.  The guidelines give information and advice to help establish new community &ldquo;watch&rdquo; groups and also to revitalise existing groups where necessary. </p><p>  Furthermore, a new Garda Text Alert Scheme, which was launched in September 2013, was piloted initially in a number of locations and developed in cooperation with Muintir na T&iacute;re, Neighbourhood Watch, the Irish Farmers Association and related stakeholders.  It provides a further mechanism for Garda&iacute; to provide crime prevention information to community contacts who in turn forward the information to all members of a community groups.  This initiative has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 500 local groups involving in excess of 100,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme.  I am informed that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. </p><p>  I am pleased to say that my Department continues to provide funding for the Community Alert programme, administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda&iacute;, which supports the operation of over 1,300 local groups.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also supports the operation of approximately 2,500 Neighbourhood Watch groups countrywide.</p><p>  In August last year, in line with the commitments in the Programme for Government, I published new guidelines for the operation of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) which have an important role in supporting local community policing partnerships.  The guidelines were finalised following a wide ranging consultation process and take account of the general reforms in local government structures.  The new JPC guidelines emphasise the need for collaborative approaches between all stakeholders to address local issues. They also underline the need for enhanced communication between JPCs, which have a strategic coordinating role, and the full range of local and community based fora which can contribute to the enhancement of community safety and support effective policing responses.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that I share the Commissioner's commitment to proactive engagement with communities in addressing crime prevention and community safety issues, and that the arrangements and measures in place are under continuous review and development.</p></reply>

There was one secondment from Grant Thornton Corporate Finance Limited for the period 12 November 2012 to 11 January 2013; one from KPMG for the period 10 December 2012 to 9 February 2013; and one from Deloitte for the period 4 February 2013 to 12 April 2013.  The individuals concerned provided expert assistance on the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland and their services were provided on a <i>pro bono</i>basis.<br/><br/>The Deputy should note that my Department is also involved in secondments, in and out, between other Departments and public sector organisations and has approximately 90 such secondments at the present time.  Typically these officers are seconded to serve in Visa Offices in Irish Embassies abroad or to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the establishment of Shared Service Centres.  Officers are seconded into the Department principally from the Courts Service to serve in the Insolvency Service of Ireland and from the Central Statistics Office.<br/><br/>A Staff Exchange Scheme between the Civil Service and the Private Sector, administered by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is designed to enhance communication, cooperation and understanding between the Civil Service and the Private Sector and to provide staff development opportunities for participants through new work experiences and project based assignments.  My Department nominated a member of staff for participation in the scheme in 2013 who was ultimately not facilitated with an actual secondment.  <br/><br/>Other secondments can also arise to address specific business needs which can be considered on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

Relevant details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. In developing the Terms of Reference due regard has been given to the emphasis on &ldquo;Mother and Baby Homes&rdquo; in the motion approved by D&aacute;il Eireann on the 11th June 2014 and the investigation will examine a wide agenda of matters in relation to these homes.  The investigation will thoroughly examine the experience of the many mothers and children who were resident in a Mother and Baby Home over the period 1922-1998. These institutions have not been the central focus of previous statutory investigations.</p><p>  From the information provided by the Deputy, it would appear that the issues being raised would not be within the remit of this particular Commission. While there are many additional matters which some might like to include, it is preferable that the investigation would focus as intended on mothers and children accommodated in Mother and Baby Homes for the purposes of extended maternity and infant care services. However as an independent Commission it will be a matter for the new Commission to decide how it proceeds with its investigations.  Once established, the Commission will publicise its contact details and the person concerned may wish to consider providing the Commission with any information in their possession which they consider may be relevant to its terms of reference.</p><p>  As we know a major investigation into historical child abuse has already been conducted by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Its remit was to inquire into the abuse of children in institutions in the period 1940 to 1999 and the broad definition of institutions covered included the particular institution raised in the details supplied. As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I do not have specific powers to make arrangements for exhumations, but I will refer the details supplied by the Deputy to Minister for Education and Skills for further consideration given her Department's role in relation to such institutions and the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. </p></reply>

Every effort will be made to notify youth organisations and projects of their 2015 allocations in respect of their youth services as soon as possible.  </p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children. </p><p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme. The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year. The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September. Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m have issued over the past month, with a third instalment in May 2015.   </p><p>  There are two School Completion Programme projects for the areas mentioned by the Deputy. The Donaghmede Ayrfield and Edenmore project is comprised of six primary schools and two post-primary schools. I am advised that an amount of &euro;214,184 was allocated by the Agency to this project for the school year 2014-2015, of which &euro;174, 024 has been paid in two instalments by 31 December 2014, with a final payment of &euro;40,160 due in May 2015. The Edenmore, Kilbarrack, Raheny SCP Project comprises of three Primary and one post-primary school. I am advised that an amount of &euro;178,203 was allocated by the Agency to this project for the school year 2014-2015, of which &euro;144,790 has been paid in two instalments by 31 December 2014, with a final payment of &euro;33,413 due in May 2015. The amounts provided for 2014-2015 take account of the savings requirements in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014. The allocation of the funding across the range of interventions planned for young people and between the local schools in the School Completion Programme project for the area is a matter for the Local Management Committee.</p><p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p><p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency. The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year. </p></reply>

The aim of this capital funding scheme was to provide much needed assistance to youth projects to improve the facilities and equipment available for their work with young people in their communities. The grants awarded under this funding scheme will provide for the up-grade or replacement of equipment or for the purchase of essential equipment to support the running of the project/organisation.<br/><br/>In December, I was pleased to announce the allocation of capital grants to 50 youth projects and organisations throughout the country. Of these, 43 of the grants were allocated to local organisations, while 7 were allocated to national organisations. The scheme was run in conjunction with the Education and Training Boards and the details of awards under the scheme are provided by Education Training Board area, in the table below. <br/><br/>In 2015, further capital funding of &euro;500,000 is being made available by my Department to support capital projects in the youth services. The focus of the 2015 scheme is a support for capital projects such as health and safety improvements to premises or the upgrade or refurbishment of premises. The closing date for applications is 27th February 2015.

A person wishing to establish a service for children should familiarise themselves with this publication, which is available on my Department's website. <br/><br/>The Children First Bill, 2014, which is currently progressing through the Oireachtas, will place key elements of the Children First National Guidance on a statutory basis once it is enacted and commenced. In effect, this means that providers of relevant services will acquire a number of statutory obligations. Under the Bill, providers of relevant services are defined as organisations which employ one or more persons. Relevant services are listed in Schedule 1 of the Children First Bill and include leisure and physical activities, such as fitness classes for children. Once the Bill is commenced, a provider of relevant services will  be required to undertake a risk assessment of the potential harm which could come to a child while availing of the services, and to then prepare a Child Safeguarding Statement which outlines the policies and procedures which are in place to mitigate the risks identified. <br/><br/>In parallel to the legislative process, my officials are currently revising and updating the existing Children First National Guidance. This is to ensure that the Guidance, which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns, reflects the new legislative obligations and provides, in one place, a complete reference resource for individuals and organisations.  This will provide clarity and ensure consistency between the proposed legislation and the existing non-statutory obligations which will continue to operate administratively for all sectors of society. <br/><br/>Requirements in relation to the vetting of persons who work with children are a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality. The Deputy should refer to the website of that Department for further information, including in relation to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, 2012.</p></reply>

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Child and Family Agency and the Ombudsman for Children's Office. </p><p>  Up to 31 December, 2013, my Department also funded the Family Support Agency (FSA) and the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  The Child and Family Agency, established on 1st January 2014 under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, has statutory responsibility for services previously provided by the NEWB and FSA. In addition, the Agency has responsibility for children and family services previously delivered by the HSE together with domestic and sexual violence services, certain psychological welfare services, and preschool inspection services. The coming together under one Agency of such a range of services provides a platform for the delivery of more efficient and effective services to children and families.  The remit of the Agency will contribute to the achievement of its overall vision, which is seeking to bring about greater integration of services with a focus on early intervention and community engagement.</p><p>  As the new Agency subsumed all of the staff and functions of the NEWB and the FSA there have been no savings of any significance accruing. The achievement of establishing the Agency means that, for the first time, there is a dedicated body responsible for child care and protection in Ireland. However, it is envisaged that when the staff of the former FSA and NEWB move into Tusla's new building, there will be a full year saving of &euro;112k based on rent.</p><p>  In July 2011, the Government decided that the Family Mediation Service should transfer from the Family Support Agency to the Legal Aid Board. This is in line with the Government's commitment to facilitate the use of mediation in family disputes  in order to speed up the legal process, reduce cost and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings. On 26 October 2011, the Minister for Justice and Equality signed the commencement order for Part 16 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 which gave effect to the transfer from 1st November 2011.</p><p>  It should be noted that following enactment of the Child Care Amendment Act 2011 the Children's Act Advisory Board was subsequently dissolved by means of the commencement by the Minister of Health of Part 6 of the Child Amendment Act 2011.</p></reply>

It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.</p><p>  A National Youth Strategy Task Group, convened by my Department, is overseeing the development of the new Strategy. This Task Group comprises statutory youth interests and voluntary agencies and organisations working with young people. I am keen that all stakeholders have a role to play in the development of the new National Youth Strategy and a comprehensive consultation process is underway at present. </p><p>  It includes online surveys of young people and those working with young people and three major stakeholder consultation events planned for later this month. These events are for young people, the youth sector, NGOs working for and with young people, Education and Training Boards, Government departments, agencies, business and academia and other youth interests. The events will include consultation on the priorities for the new Strategy and the findings of the recently completed Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes. The Review makes recommendations for the future operation of youth funding schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure effective, value for money services that will be evidence based and improve outcomes for young people. </p><p>  The consultation will run into February 2015 and I anticipate that the Strategy will be completed promptly thereafter.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives which operate across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools across the country and  provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children. </p><p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme. The amount allocated to the Programme for 2014-2015 takes account of the savings requirements in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014. I am advised that the Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year. The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September. Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m have issued over the past month, with a third instalment in May 2015.   </p><p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p><p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency. The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.    The review of the School Completion Programme is an important initiative in planning for the future development of the programme. It will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future. Preliminary information gathered in the review indicates that the School Completion Programme encompasses a broad and diverse range of measures and interventions that have been developed by local projects over the years. The intention is to learn more about the most successful of these, share the learning across the programme and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services that provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage. </p></reply>

It is important to state that assessment is a dynamic process and children's prioritisation ratings can change.  </p><p>  The main principle underlying the Child and Family Agency's prioritisation criteria is that children at greatest risk of harm are given the highest priority.  This is overseen by the principal social worker in each area who ensures that all cases are reviewed regularly both on an individual basis in supervision with social work teams and on a service wide basis every month.   </p><p>  The turnover of social workers in the Agency's first year of operation (2014) was 6.7% which compares favourably with other countries. Since its establishment, the Agency has recruited 155 social workers and a further 193 posts are currently at various stages of recruitment.  Also, a pilot Maternity Leave scheme has been introduced whereby temporary staff can be offered a 12 month contract to cover maternity leave. In addition and in recognition of the challenging nature of child welfare and protection work, new entrants and graduates have a reduced workload for their first year, with opportunities for regular supervision with experienced practitioners. </p><p>  The Agency has a  funding provision of &euro;643 million in 2015 including over &euro;12 million in capital funding.

For the academic year 2014/2015, based on standard rate payments of &euro;62.50 per child per week and an enrolment of 15 children, this service will be entitled to a total funding in the region of &euro;35,000 under this programme. </p><p>  The CETS programme supports parents who are endeavouring to enter or return to the workforce and who are participating in training or educational courses for this purpose.  Funding of &euro;4,259 was allocated to this service for the calendar year 2014.  In relation to 2015, funding will be determined by the number of children enrolled throughout the year whose parents qualify for support under the programme.</p><p>  Capital funding of &euro;2.5 million was provided under the Early Years Capital Programme 2014 for the maintenance and upgrade of community/not-for-profit childcare services.   This group was approved capital funding of &euro;36,841 under that programme of which 90% or &euro;33,157 was paid out.  The final 10% of the grant is dependent upon the review by Pobal of the financial return submitted by the service.  It is expected that this review will be completed shortly  .</p></reply>

As well as contributing to high levels of ED admissions, these factors can present difficulties in discharging such patients to home or other appropriate care settings.  In addition, changes in service provision (e.g. cancer services) have increased the general patient attendance at Beaumont, placing additional pressures on bed capacity.</p><p>  All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  Beaumont Hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve the patient pathway both through the ED and the hospital, in addition to working closely with the community.  All available bed capacity is open and off-site capacity is also being utilised. Elective surgeries (with the exception of cancer cases) have been cancelled for this week and this option is being kept under constant review.  The HSE would encourage patients to contact their GPs in the first instance where they can be directed appropriately to services such as rapid access clinics, day hospital services for older people and acute medical assessment units, as appropriate.</p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of  &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges. This funding is being targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and therefore improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  The Minister convened the Emergency Department Taskforce to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  Following an initial meeting in December, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of January to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.</p></reply>

These services include needle exchange provision, together with evidence-based treatment options such as methadone maintenance treatment, counselling and community-based and residential rehabilitation.</p><p>  In relation to the drug problem in Dublin city centre, the HSE, in partnership with a local voluntary service provider, Dublin City Council and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has set up an assertive case management programme to engage with the cohort who are  involved in public drug use. The pilot programme, which will be monitored and evaluated, is designed to provide the best possible outcomes for these individuals and address their issues of homelessness and addiction using shared resources. The HSE also cooperate with the local community representatives of the North and South Inner City and with local Garda&iacute; to minimise any negative public order issues that may arise in the vicinity of its treatment centres.</p><p>  The HSE Service Plan for 2015 includes an additional &euro;2.1 million for measures under the National Drugs Strategy which will benefit vulnerable problem drug users in the Dublin area. These measures include enhanced provision for residential detoxification and rehabilitation facilities and a demonstration project by the HSE, which aims to increase access to naloxone for opioid users. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist which is used to reverse the effects of opioids such as heroin, morphine and methadone and has been proven to be an effective way of reducing the number of opioid overdose deaths. </p><p>  The introduction of medically supervised injecting centres in Ireland would raise a number of serious issues including patient safety and legal concerns. Therefore, the Government's focus is on providing more opportunities for people to move on from illicit drug use, through drug treatment and rehabilitation, to a drug-free life where that is achievable. </p></reply>

Applications are being assessed by former High Court Judge Maureen Harding Clark. The Scheme has in the region of &euro;34 million available and participants will receive awards at three levels - &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000. The Scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned. It was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment.  It was established to give women who do not wish to pursue their cases through the courts an alternative, simple, non-adversarial option.</p><p>  Applications had to be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date. The closing  date for receipt of applications was therefore Friday 5 December 2014. In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark  has discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.  </p><p>  Judge Clark has informed my officials that, as of 9 January, 2015:</p><p>  -  568 applications were received by her office by the closing date of 5 December, 2015;</p><p>  -  75 offers were made amounting to over &euro;5,250,000;</p><p>  -  23 late applications were received, between the closing date and 9 January.  Of these, 10 were accepted, 4 were rejected and the remainder are currently being considered by Judge Clark.</p><p>  I understand that no offer that has been made to date has been rejected. It is also important to note that where there was a delay arising in the compilation of a woman's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, applications were accepted by the Scheme, provided the application was received within the time period set out in the Scheme, with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation.</p><p>  My Department made payments to 29 women before Christmas amounting to &euro;1,850,000, with a further 5 payments imminent.</p><p>  The Scheme is voluntary and I would like to emphasise that women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.</p><p>  The Government hopes the implementation of this Scheme will help to bring closure on this issue for the women concerned and their families.</p></reply>

It comprises of three integrated units: a clinical genetics service; a cytogenetics laboratory and a molecular genetics laboratory. The service is under the governance of OLCHC, which has recently made a decision to discontinue the separate identification of the service as the National Centre for Medical Genetics, in the interest of clarity on governance arrangements. I am assured  that there has been no reduction in the scope of the services provided.</p><p>  There have been rapid and progressive developments in genetics and genomic medicine over the past five years, and it is well recognised as one area of medicine that will continue to rapidly develop over coming years. A review of the service at Crumlin, commissioned by the HSE was submitted in May this year.  This report made a number of recommendations on both internal and national service issues, which will be addressed by the HSE in conjunction with OLCHC / the Children's Hospital Group. The report included a recommendation that a working group should be established, to develop a National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network that reflects best international practice. Any concerns on the network of services will be addressed by this group's work.</p><p>  The National Rare Disease Plan recognised that the timely diagnosis of rare diseases is essential. Effective genetic services have a role to play in diagnosing rare diseases; and it was in this context that the plan referred to the work of the NCMG at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. A National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases has been established in the HSE. A Clinical Lead for this programme has also been appointed. This clinical programme will ultimately be a channel for advancing and implementing recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases.</p></reply>

International best practice recommends that a population based cervical screening programme should target women aged from 25 or 30 years to 60 or 65 years.</p><p>  Invasive cervical cancer is extremely rare in women aged under 25, with less than 5 women in this age group being diagnosed with this condition each year.  There was one death from cervical cancer in women below the age of 25 in the years 2008-2012.  While changes in the cells of the cervix are very common for those under 25, in the vast majority of cases these changes will settle and return to normal without intervention.  If the screening age was lowered to invite those under 25 for smear tests, young women  could be subjected to unnecessary treatment that could have potential long-term negative effects on their health and fertility.</p><p>  I would encourage all women aged under 25 to be vigilant about their health and to consult their GP immediately if they have any symptoms which would raise the suspicion of cervical cancer.  If necessary, their GP will refer them to a gynaecology clinic for further investigation.  Meanwhile, any women concerned about their family risk of cancer should discuss this with their GP.</p><p>  I would also encourage all 12-18 year old schoolgirls to avail of the free HPV vaccination which is offered in second level schools.</p></reply>

PSI Guidelines on the Equipment Requirements of a Retail Pharmacy Business issued in draft form in 2012 and will be published in the PSI January 2015 Newsletter.  These advise pharmacy practitioners that, &ldquo;A high standard of equipment maintenance and cleanliness must be consistently applied. Equipment should be maintained, serviced and calibrated in accordance with the manufacturers&rsquo; instructions and records of such service and calibration should be kept.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Currently within the HSE Addiction Treatment Centres the pumps that are used are calibrated by the company contracted to provide methadone to the services.  The pumps are calibrated every six months to ISO standards by an external calibration agency. Each of the centres has Standard Operating Procedures for calibration and maintenance of the pumps. <br/><br/>In community pharmacy, pumps are not universally used for the measurement of methadone. Many community pharmacies use CE marked graduated cylinders in general and decant from 500 ml bottles, with the exception of some high volume dispensaries that may use a pump system. <br/><br/>The Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 (S.I. No 328 of 1988) requires pharmacies to maintain a Controlled Drugs (CD) Register in respect of all drugs, including methadone, listed in Schedule 2, with a running balance. Inspections are carried out by the PSI, under Section 67 of the Pharmacy Act 2007.  The sale and supply of all Schedule 2 controlled drugs and the manner in which the CD Register is maintained are checked as part of these inspections. The register is reviewed to see if running balances are properly maintained. <br/><br/>Manufacturers&rsquo; bottles of methadone liquid contain a small &lsquo;overage&rsquo; in some cases. The volume declared would be the nominal volume. In other words, if the label states 500 ml then at least 500 ml must be available for administration. That is the standard for medicines, and this means that a slight excess is included to allow the correct volume to be withdrawn. There is no upper limit in the pharmacopoeias (standards).<br/><br/>The extra liquid can result in a pharmacy having more methadone than expected in certain circumstances, and this should be accounted for through the regular balance checks and reconciliation. To assist pharmacists in maintaining the CD register for methadone products, PSI Inspectors have provided advice that is now available on the PSI website - .  This advice states that the CD register must be regularly reviewed to ensure the pharmacist can satisfy themselves that the register has been completed correctly for all controlled drugs, including methadone. Excess methadone is always accounted for with the CD register per the guidance that has been issued to account for &lsquo;overage&rsquo;. <br/><br/>If there is excess stock compared to the expected balance and the pharmacist is satisfied that this is due to &lsquo;overage&rsquo; from manufacturers&rsquo; bottles, the running balance may be adjusted to reflect the current stock level. This entry should be signed by the pharmacist and annotated to show that the adjustment is the result of &lsquo;overage' and their calculations documented in the CD register.<br/><br/>The latest figures available show that a total quantity of 142,119,673 mls of methadone was dispensed through community pharmacies in 2013 for palliative care and for the treatment of opiate dependency.  The total quantity of methadone dispensed through the HSE addiction centres for the treatment of opioid dependency was<i></i>73,530,249 mls of methadone.</p></reply>

The HSE is actively working with disability providers towards the migration of more services in 2015 to this person-centred supports model.<br/><br/>The Government&rsquo;s policy is this area is set out in<b></b>the <i>Report of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland </i>(<i>VFM Review)</i>, which recommends migration from an approach which is predominantly organised around group-based service delivery towards a model of person-centred and individually chosen community-based supports underpinned by a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use.<br/><br/>The implementation of the recommendations in the VFM Review has been given priority in the HSE&rsquo;s <i>National Service Plan</i>for 2015. A number of HSE working groups established to support the reform process will continue their work during 2015 on a range of inter-connected and challenging projects which will support and drive the move to a more personalised and socially inclusive service. <br/><br/>Key priorities for the HSE in 2015 which will progress the move towards greater individualisation of service delivery include:<br/><br/>-  Progress on the reconfiguration of residential services, which will support people to move from institutional settings to the community in line with their person-centred plans and in full consultation with the individuals and their families;<br/><br/>-  Provision of new day services and supports to approximately 1,400 young people with continuing support needs who are due to leave school and rehabilitative (life-skills) programmes in 2015 and measures to ensure that these new placements are individualised and person-centred. &euro;6m additional funding has been allocated in 2015 (at a full year cost of &euro;12m) for these new placements;<br/><br/>-  Progress on the reconfiguration of adult day services towards a model of person-centred supports.</p></reply>

I want to commend the participants for taking the time to discuss this very important topic and for summarising their views for me. I would like to assure the participants that I have read their submission very carefully and have taken on board the points made, which are clustered around the following issues:<br/><br/>- the cost of having an intellectual disability in Ireland;<br/><br/>- bullying;<br/><br/>- having more choice and control over services; and<br/><br/>- housing and respite services.<br/><br/>Many of the points made in the correspondence touch on the responsibilities of a number of my colleagues as well as myself, and I will make sure that my colleagues are made aware of these views.  This is a time of major change in the delivery of health-funded disability services in this country, as described in the <i>Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland,</i>and will result in shifting choice and control from professionals and administrators and giving it back to the individual with a disability, and his or her family. <br/><br/>One of the working groups established by the Health Service Executive to drive this change is examining how best to ensure that service users have a meaningful voice and role in service design and delivery &ndash; this working group is chaired by the Chief Executive of Inclusion Ireland. Other working groups are addressing issues such as the transformation of day and residential services from services which were mostly delivered in segregated group-based settings into individualised and person-centred services, delivered in the community. <br/><br/>By working in partnership we will achieve maximum independence, choice and inclusion for people with disabilities and we will realize the vision of a more equitable service for everyone, where services and supports will be tailored to meet individual need while at the same time being provided in an accountable and cost effective manner. </p></reply>

The funding is being used to continue to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children, to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, forensic mental health services, and to enhance access counselling and psychotherapy in primary care and investment in suicide prevention measures. <br/><br/>Details of the overall gross non-capital mental health budget are published annually in the Revised Book of Estimates.  Based on that information, the table below details the mental health budget for each of the years 2011 - 2014 inclusive:<table><tr><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;712 million</td><td>&euro;711 million</td><td>&euro;737 million</td><td>&euro;766 million</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The estimated provision for mental health in 2015 is &euro;791.8 million.<br/><br/>Budgetary and other pressures within the HSE delayed the full utilisation of the &euro;35 million allocated in both 2012 and 2013.  The underspend in planned Mental Health expenditure and the timing of the recruitment of staff developments was also due to the time needed to get various programmes up and running, such as Counselling in Primary Care, Enhanced Teamworking, Mental Health Information System, Clinical Programmes and the opening of additional in-patient beds.<br/><br/>In relation to the &euro;20 million provided in Budget 2014, the HSE National Service Plan provided for the phasing-in of the expenditure, in order for the HSE to live within its overall available resource across its service areas.  It was planned that recruitment of 2014 posts would be started in order to provide for posts to come on stream during Quarter 4 and to this end, an amount of &euro;5 million was expected to be spent in 2014 from the 2014 allocation.  The HSE has informed me that a detailed analysis took place during 2014 of all 9,000 staff in Mental Health Services to inform the decision making process on the prioritised allocation of approximately 250 new posts.  Although full recruitment did not takes place during Quarter 4 2014, the posts appointed required &euro;0.250m with the remainder of the &euro;5 million largely expended on the opening of unfunded but approved capacity in the National Forensic Service in order to provide sufficient extra capacity to meet the requirements of the Criminal Law Insanity Act.  This &euro;20 million is also now available to spend in full on mental health services in 2015, along with the new additional funding of &euro;35m provided in Budget 2015. </p></reply>

A number of mental health services have provided crisis houses as part of their community residential provision and, as the mental health services move away from the provision of low and medium support community residences, opportunities to provide the crisis house model will be explored. In other areas, respite arrangements are in place to address the emergency needs of service users.<br/><br/>As part of the investment in mental health in 2013, 35 posts were identified to provide for the implementation of the Clinical Programme to address self-harm presentations in emergency departments. Currently 23 of these posts are in place and the remainder are in the recruitment process. <br/><br/>The focus continues to be on building the capacity of community mental health teams across Child and Adolescent, General Adult and Psychiatry of Old Age to provide a comprehensive community-based secondary care response. The investment in mental health in 2012 and 2013 meant that almost 900 new mental health professionals are taking their places on community mental health teams and working to introduce the new clinical programmes.<br/><br/>The Suicide Crisis Assessment Nursing Service (SCAN) provides a skilled mental health nursing service to Primary Care that is<br/><br/>-  available, accessible and speedy in providing a response to GP requests for a timely assessment of those in suicide/self harm distress<br/><br/>-  Carries out a comprehensive (bio-psycho-social) needs and risk assessment of the client within the GP surgery<br/><br/>-  Works collaboratively in partnership with the GP (and the wider specialist mental and local community services, as appropriate) to institute a health/social care plan to meet the risk and care needs of the client.<br/><br/>Initially piloted by the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) in South Dublin Cluain Mhuire Mental Health Services and Wexford Mental Health services, the service is currently under development in Waterford, Donegal, Sligo/Leitrim, Dublin North, Dublin South Central, Cork North, Galway/Roscommon and Laois/Offaly. <br/><br/>The NOSP also funds over 42 services within the statutory and voluntary sector such as Samaritans, Pieta House, Console - many of whom provide direct support to individuals in crisis.  In 2014, the Samaritans free-call Connect number 116 123 was launched.<br/><br/>The HSE National Mental Health Division Operational Plan 2015 which was published on 18<sup>th</sup>December, 2014 identifies specific actions to ensure access to mental health services for individuals accessing community mental health services.  This includes building the capacity in 2015 to respond on a 24/7 basis to service users engaged with the community mental health services and, as an initial step, to put in place weekend cover for identified service users of the community mental health services.</p></reply>

Short term counselling (up to eight sessions) is provided for adults with non-complex psychological problems aged 18 and over and who hold a valid medical card.  Referral into the service is by the person's GP or other member of the Primary Care Team.</p><p>  The establishment of the CIPC initiative is aimed at providing a more immediate response to wider community for persons in need of counselling and advice.  If deemed necessary, persons presenting with more serious crisis issues can be referred on to the appropriate HSE community mental health services.</p><p>  Most recent figures available from 9 of the 10 CIPC services indicate that between the period January to end September 2014 there were 10,601 referrals to the service, 31,232 sessions were offered with 1,683 individuals in counselling at end September 2014 and approximately 285 days of counselling being offered every day across 143 locations.</p></reply>

A further &euro;35 million has been provided for 2015, bringing the total allocated to this area by this Government to &euro;125 million. The funding is being used to continue to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children, to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, forensic mental health services, and to enhance access to counselling and psychotherapy in primary care and investment in suicide prevention measures. <br/><br/>As at end November 2014, 397 or 95% of the 2012 posts and 362 or 77% of the 2013 posts have been filled, with a further 4 WTEs with agreed start dates after 30th November 2014.  The remainder of the posts are at various stages of recruitment, however there are some difficulties in identifying some outstanding candidates for geographic and qualification reasons.<br/><br/>With regard to the 2014 posts, some 220 posts have been identified following a comprehensive workforce analysis and recruitment of these posts has commenced.  Services are targeting recruitment of all posts as early as possible in 2015. <br/><br/>During the period between in question, the number of staff has fluctuated due to departures for various reasons, including redundancy, retirement or staff moving to take up employment elsewhere.  At the end of November 2014, the total number of whole time equivalent staff (WTEs) in the HSE Mental Health Services was 8,953.  This compares with 9,207 WTEs listed in the HSE National Service Plan at the end of 2011, which represents a net loss of 254 WTEs over the period to end 2014.  However, it is important to note that recruitment of posts under the new allocation did not commence until the end of 2012, at which time there were 8,909 WTEs in place.  The recruitment of new posts, while challenging in the current environment,  has enabled the gradual decline in posts to be arrested, resulting in a slight drop of 3 posts at the end of 2013 (8,906), compared to the end of 2012, but in an increase of 47 WTEs at the end of November 2014 (8,953), compared to start of that year.<br/><br/>The additional funding provided since 2012 is enabling the HSE to recruit staff who are more suited to the development of a community-focussed mental health service and has provided for a required change in the mix of staff, in particular Allied Health Professionals, across Community Mental Health Teams, in line with <i>A Vision for Change.  </i>The targeted actions now relate to addressing the skills shortages, largely in nursing and psychology, which are being considered in terms of how we can attract and source these professionals and how incentivised schemes are affecting decisions of experienced staff to leave the service.<br/><br/>The key priorities in the HSE's 2015 National Service Plan include:<br/><br/>- devising a funded Workforce Plan and Workforce Development Strategy to ensure an adequate level of trained and skilled staff;<br/><br/>- developing and implementing a process to maximise the allocation of resources on an equitable basis aligned to population and deprivation, and <br/><br/>- addressing the infrastructure and support deficits for staff to work effectively within their professions.<br/><br/>These priority actions will build on the significant foundational reform of our Mental Health Services, initiated in the HSE NSP 2014, which included initial work on workforce planning, training and development and improved recruitment services.  </p></reply>

These figures indicate that there was a decrease in the number of deaths where methadone was implicated, with 86 such deaths reported in 2012 compared to 118 in 2011.  The majority of these deaths (87%) involved poly-substance poisonings.  There is clear evidence that having access to drug treatment is one of the main factors in reducing drug-related deaths.  </p><p>  Methadone maintenance treatment is a critical stabilising treatment that enables people to counter their problem drug use.   The HSE provides methadone maintenance in a number of treatment settings to meet the needs of individual drug users.  According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction,  methadone is the most commonly prescribed substitution treatment for problem opiate use in Europe.  In conjunction with other services and supports such as counselling, after-care and training, methadone maintenance treatment provides a pathway to recovery for the individual affected by problem substance use.  </p><p>  The HSE Service Plan for 2015 includes an additional &euro;2.1m for addiction services targeting vulnerable problem drug users. These measures include enhanced provision for residential detoxification and rehabilitation facilities and the mainstreaming of needle exchange facilities outside the Dublin area.  This funding will also support a pilot demonstration project by the HSE, which is designed to increase access to naloxone for opioid users.  Naloxone is an opioid antagonist which is used to reverse the effects of overdose of opioids such as heroin, morphine and methadone and has been proven to be an effective way of reducing the number of opioid overdose deaths.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-14a.1620.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011400083#WRJJ03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 590 and 591 together.</p><p>  Lyme Disease (also known as Lyme borelliosis) is an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium called Borella burgdorferi. It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria. The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80-90% of patients.</p><p>  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by a medical history and physical examination and can be difficult if there has been no erythema migrans rash. The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to B. burgdorferi produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step. Screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever. In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. Samples giving reactive or equivocal tests in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests. Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity. Using this outlined two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease. Testing for Lyme borelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.</p><p>  There is an ongoing publicity campaign regarding Lyme Disease. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is establishing a Lyme Borelliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme borelliosis in Ireland. This will involve raising awareness among clinicians and the general public. It will explore ways to ensure these messages are brought to the general public with the frequency and in forms in which they can be most effective. </p><p>  Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising regarding prevention and treatment of Lyme Disease, the HPSC holds a Lyme Disease Awareness Week in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages. As part of last year's Awareness Week, a supply of information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a &quot;Tickborne Disease Toolkit&quot;, developed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). This toolkit was modified for use in Ireland and posted on the HPSC website. Indeed, the ECDC informed the HPSC that Ireland was the first European Member State to make such extensive use of this material. Following the Awareness Week, a 100% increase of web traffic to the various Lyme Disease sections of the HPSC website was noted. </p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014. </p><p>  The Department of Health has responsibility for the oversight and governance of the NMBI Board but has no role in the setting or approval of fees, so any resolution must come about through discussions between the NMBI and the staff associations. I am monitoring the situation closely and I have asked both sides to reach a satisfactory resolution as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.

Some of these factors, such as random DNA mutations during cell division, are outside of an individual's control.  However, the study acknowledges that there are also many opportunities for cancer prevention, such as adopting healthy lifestyle choices and the early detection of cancers. </p><p>  My Department and the HSE are promoting healthier lifestyles to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, including cancer.   The focus in this regard is on prevention and on keeping people healthier for longer. Also, our national breast, cervical and bowel screening programmes have a key role to play in saving lives by detecting cancer at an early stage.  </p><p>  The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 30% of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors.  Tobacco use is considered to be the single most important risk factor for cancer.  The EU recently re-launched its European Code Against Cancer which identifies a number of ways in which people can reduce their risk of cancer, including through not smoking, being physically active, having a healthy diet and avoiding too much sun exposure.</p><p>  The issue of cancer prevention will be addressed as part of the development this year of the next National Cancer Strategy.</p></reply>

Hospital EDs seek to manage any possible risks for patients so as to minimise any safety issues and keep risk to an absolute minimum in what are very difficult circumstances in many EDs at present.

However, TrolleyGAR figures collated at 2pm indicated that this number had reduced to 317 and by 8pm the number had further reduced to 272 due to the active intervention of staff both within hospitals and in primary and community care services.</p><p>  All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  These plans include the opening of additional overflow areas, reopening of closed beds, provision of additional diagnostic scans and Consultants doing additional ward rounds to improve the appropriate flow of patients through the hospital system.  Other actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Fair Deal places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams.</p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of  &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges. This funding is being targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and therefore improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists. </p><p>  The Minister convened the Emergency Department Taskforce to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  Following an initial meeting in December, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of January to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015. </p></reply>

All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  These plans include the opening of additional overflow areas, reopening of closed beds, provision of additional diagnostic scans and Consultants doing additional ward rounds to improve the appropriate flow of patients through the hospital system.  Other actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Fair Deal places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams.</p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges. This funding is being targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and therefore improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.</p><p>  The Minister convened the Emergency Department Taskforce to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  Following an initial meeting in December, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of January to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.</p></reply>

The method and timescale for the delivery of health care infrastructure is a dynamic process which is constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.  There is limited funding available for new projects over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place. The HSE will always concentrate on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet prioritised needs now and in the future.</p><p>  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office who will follow up on the matter.</p></reply>

To deliver on these, the following are examples of a range of actions that are being put into effect immediately or in the short-term by the HSE.</p><p>  The HSE is putting arrangements in place for a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications involving significant medical conditions to ensure greater interaction between the central office regarding the assessment of a person&rsquo;s eligibility and the local health office regarding the person&rsquo;s medical condition and the services that they may require. The HSE has appointed a senior manager to lead the reform of the systems for handling medical card application and reviews. </p><p>  The HSE is developing a single, integrated process for people to apply for a medical card, a GP visit card, the Long-Term Illness Scheme and the Drugs Payment Scheme. Access points will be established around the country in health offices to support and assist people to make applications. </p><p>  A clinical advisory group will be established by the HSE to develop guidance on assessing applications involving significant medical conditions so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them. </p><p>  The Minister and I have asked the HSE to examine, with the Department of Health, the best way to meet the needs of people with significant medical conditions who need the support of the public health system. This work includes considering the best way to make medical aids and appliances available to persons who do not hold a medical card, the provision of services to children with severe disabilities, and to enable people with particular needs to have these met on an individual basis rather than awarding a medical card to all family members.</p></reply>

The HSE controls the release of funding to manage the funds that are available across the course of the year. Funding is released to approved applicants according to their place, in order of their approval date, on the National Placement List. Over recent months, demand for funding has exceeded what could be released and the national placement list has grown as a result. </p><p>  In July 2014, the HSE allocated &euro;5m for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.

It is anticipated that the figures will continue to fluctuate, but the collaborative arrangements now in place with the professional bodies and management are having an impact. All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care. </p><p>   Triage is operated to prioritise patients so that those with most acute needs are seen and treated as soon as possible. Hospital EDs seek to manage any possible risks for patients so as to minimise any safety issues and keep risk to an absolute minimum in what are very difficult circumstances in many EDs at present. Senior clinicians are part of this system and the responsibility to minimise potential risk and ensure the safest possible care is a responsibility they deal with as part of their duties every day in hospitals. </p><p>  Measures to manage ED surges involve the full health system including primary, community and continuing care services to ensure that all available capacity and options are utilised and brought to bear on the situation. HSE have advised  that at present:</p><p>  - Additional beds to cope with surge pressures are open</p><p>  - All non-urgent elective procedures have been cancelled but urgent and cancer surgeries will continue</p><p>  - Day surgery facilities are in use to provide additional capacity for overflow purposes</p><p>  - Ambulance bypass cover arrangements will be invoked in exceptional circumstances and with the prior agreement of the Group CEO and participating hospitals</p><p>  - The role of consultant doctors in terms of ensuring additional ward rounds and patient transfers has been emphasised with the aim of discharging patients as soon as they are fit and well enough to go home or to other care facilities.</p><p>  - The use of additional capacity in non-acute hospitals, particularly to provide rehabilitation care, is being expedited where possible (e.g. St. Luke's/Cappagh/Navan) </p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges. This funding is being targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and therefore improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists. </p><p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to the situation at Naas General Hospital. If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

Historically a large number of Irish graduate nurses have found posts in acute hospitals in Ireland or abroad more attractive and the sector has relied on attracting nurses from abroad to fill these posts.</p><p>  The six weeks adaptation course (for overseas nurses) referred to is not a matter for the Department but a matter for the Nursing &amp;amp; Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The central tenet of the NMBI is the protection of the public and as such the NMBI must be fully satisfied that each application for registration is fully reviewed and decisions reached are in full compliance with the requirements and standards for registration. Individuals who have queries regarding the application process or outcome of an individual assessment should contact the NMBI directly.  </p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority is the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007 to drive continuous improvement and to monitor safety and quality in Ireland&rsquo;s health and personal social care services. Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private have been registered and inspected by HIQA. The Health Act (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for older people) Regulations, 2013 contain provisions for the purpose of ensuring proper standards of care in nursing homes and include a requirement that the number and skill mix of staff is appropriate having regard to the assessed needs of the residents, and the size and layout of the centre in question. There is also a requirement that the staff of a designated centre includes, at all times, at least one registered nurse.</p><p>  With regard to pressures in the health system, the budget for the Nursing Home Support Scheme in 2015 is &euro;948.8m. This includes an increase of &euro;10m allocated to the initiative related to delayed discharges. This increase will allow for the provision of an additional 300 long stay care places under the NHSS.  In 2015 the HSE's National Service Plan's projected target of people in receipt of financial support for long term residential care is 22,361. In light of the recent pressures in Emergency Departments the HSE is accessing all suitable non-acute accommodation to the maximum extent possible to allow those who have been clinically discharged to leave acute hospitals. </p></reply>

This Group will again include health professionals, administrators, researchers, and advocates. In addition, the Group will include a number of new members including a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.<br/><br/>With one exception (because the relevant person is directly involved in implementing elements of the Strategy and is therefore unavailable), all the members of the expert Working Group which assisted in formulating the Strategy have been invited to join the new Monitoring Group.  In addition there will be a number of new members, as follows:<br/><br/>- Ms. Helen Rochford-Brennan, who will represent people living with dementia.<br/><br/>- Dr. Richard Aboud, who is a General Practitioner.<br/><br/>- Professor Eamonn O&rsquo;Shea, who is an expert on ageing issues and will represent Atlantic Philanthropies.<br/><br/>- Mr. John Linehan, Head of HSE&rsquo;s Dementia Strategy Implementation Office.<br/><br/>The Monitoring Group&rsquo;s remit is as follows:<br/><br/>- To monitor and assess progress on the implementation of the recommendations in the National Dementia Strategy;<br/><br/>- To identify any factors with the potential to affect the delivery of the Priority Actions, including the three Priority Activities within the Implementation Programme agreed with The Atlantic Philanthropies;<br/><br/>- To make recommendations in relation to the manner in which the Strategy is implemented;<br/><br/>- To advise on the establishment of a monitoring and reporting framework (to include key performance indicators) which is valid both nationally and locally to track change and improvement over the agreed period in respect of dementia services,<br/><br/>- To advise on the commissioning framework for Strategy evaluation following from the Expert Advisory Panel <i>(</i>This is a small technical group to advise specifically on evaluation issues),<br/><br/>- To report to the Minister of State<b></b>for Older People twice yearly on progress made towards implementing the recommendations of the National Dementia Strategy. The Minister will in turn report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform  <b>. </b><br/><br/>The Strategy specifically acknowledges the fact that many people under the age of 65 are living with dementia, and both the members of the Monitoring Group and those leading the Strategy&rsquo;s practical implementation are very conscious of the particular challenges posed for younger people by dementia, and of the need to respond to those challenges <br/><br/>A number of the priorities identified within the Strategy will be of benefit to people under 65 with dementia. Early diagnosis will assist in ensuring people under 65 will be diagnosed earlier.  A key aim of the Strategy is to identify the services currently available to people under 65, and to plan to address gaps that may now exist. The Dementia Awareness and Stigma Programme element of the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will seek to increase awareness of dementia in this age group, and to provide more age specific information for them. Six Dementia Advisors (under the aegis of the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland) are also in place in various locations and will support people with a diagnosis of dementia, including those under 65. Early onset dementia may cross a number of care groups, and a HSE Cross Departmental Group will work to integrate service provision for people under 65 with dementia. Consideration will also be given to providing tailored packages of  intensive home supports that are appropriate to younger people with Dementia, as part of the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme.<br/><br/>The Strategy&rsquo;s objectives include the need to make hospitals dementia-friendly from admission to discharge or death, which includes environmental aspects as well as clinical support. There is a commitment to the development by the Health Service Executive of a dementia and delirium care pathway, which can be fitted to existing acute care pathways and implemented on a local level in each acute hospital. In addition the HSE will assign responsibility within its own facilities and elsewhere will encourage the assignment of responsibility to a senior clinician within each hospital to lead the development, implementation and monitoring of the care pathway.<br/><br/>Hospitals will be required to ensure that people with dementia have a specific pathway through Emergency Departments and Acute Hospital Medical Units that is appropriate to their particular sensory and psychosocial needs. The HSE will develop guidelines on dementia-friendly ward specification to be taken into account at the design stage of all refurbishments and new builds. Elements to be considered should include safe walking spaces and the use of colour, lighting, signage, orientation cues and space used to promote social interaction.<br/><br/>Hospitals will prioritise the assessments of social and environmental supports to meet the needs of people with dementia and their carers, including access to appropriate social work support.<br/><br/>While exact financial allocations will be firmed up as implementation progresses, our agreement with the Atlantic Philanthropies provides that the &euro;27.5m which is available for the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will broadly be allocated as follows:<br/><br/>Provision of intensive home supports ~ &euro;22.1m<br/><br/>Dementia Awareness Programme ~ &euro;2.7m<br/><br/>Education programme for GPs/Primary Care teams ~ &euro;1.2m<br/><br/>National Dementia Strategy Implementation Office and supports ~ &euro;1.5m<br/><br/>Financial supports for Carers are mainly provided through Schemes administered by the Department of Social Protection. Details of these supports are available on that Department&rsquo;s website (www.welfare.ie), these include - Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Respite Care Grant, and Domiciliary Care Allowance.</p></reply>

The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the costs of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.  In the meantime, monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme closed.</p><p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE. <br/><br/>Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown below. The waiting times for orthodontic treatment in the HSE South region at the end of Quarter 3 2014 are as follows:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment</th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months</th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>25-36 months</th><th>37-48 months</th><th>Over 48 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE South</td><td>704</td><td>506</td><td>832</td><td>958</td><td>435</td><td>33</td><td>3,468</td></tr></table><br/><br/>In addition to the services provided by HSE staff, orthodontic treatment for certain categories of misalignment will be provided by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years.  A national procurement process is currently underway and is due to be ready for commencement shortly.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for 4 years or longer. It is expected that this initiative will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

In doing so, the HPRA is required to have regard to a comprehensive set of qualifying conditions, all of which must be complied with before a decision is taken to make a medicinal product interchangeable. </p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable products. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price the HSE will reimburse to pharmacists for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.</p><p>  For any medicine that is listed as being interchangeable the legislation provides that a Pharmacist may offer a generic or alternative version of the branded medicine which is set at the reference price.  Eligible patients using State drug schemes like the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme will not face any additional costs for products priced at or below the reference price.  If a patient would like to receive a particular brand that costs more than the reference price then the patient will have to pay the additional cost of that product. </p><p>  Section 13 of the Act provides that where a branded interchangeable product is prescribed for a patient and the prescriber is satisfied that the medicinal product, should for clinical reasons, be exempted from substitution, the prescriber shall write 'Do not Substitute' on the prescription.  In these cases, the pharmacist must dispense what is written on the prescription, i.e. is not permitted to substitute with any product in the same group of interchangeable products and patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

The group includes representatives of the HSE, the Irish Kidney Association, Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, the Intensive Care Society of Ireland and my Department.   Much of the emphasis in relation to awareness is on encouraging people to discuss organ donation with their loved ones so that informed decisions, to the benefit of all, can be made if the unfortunate circumstances of potential donation ever arise. </p>  <p>  In March I will launch Organ Donor Awareness Week which is organised by the Irish Kidney Association and part-funded by my Department.  Many events will take place that week across the country to encourage organ donation.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the Heads of a Human Tissue Bill that will include the establishment of a legal framework in relation to the donation of organs for transplantation.  A register of those who do not wish to become organ donors after death is envisaged in the context of the introduction of an opt-out system of consent.  However, no organs will be taken without the agreement of the next-of-kin.</p>  <p>  There will always be fluctuations in the number of organs donated from deceased donors on an annual basis but I am working to ensure that the necessary steps are being taken to encourage donation where the opportunity arises.</p></reply>

Additional funding of &euro;20m was allocated in 2013 to strengthen Primary Care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts.  As part of this initiative, the HSE commenced recruitment last year of over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams, which included 52 Speech and Language Therapists.  All of these Speech and Language Therapy posts have been filled.  This will help to significantly address waiting times for such services.</p>  <p>In relation to services for children with disabilities, the re-configuration of children&rsquo;s disability services into geographically-based teams as part of the HSE&rsquo;s National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)  will ensure a more equitable delivery of services.  An additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts, of which 31 are Speech and Language Therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million will also be made to support the development of therapy services in 2015 (equating to &euro;6m in a full year).  The HSE is currently considering the breakdown of the posts involved.  However, it is expected that this will include a number of Speech and Language Therapy posts.</p>  <p>  Information in relation to the other aspects of the Deputy's question is not routinely available in my Department; therefore, I have asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to reply directly to the Deputy.

The budget for the NHSS in 2015 is &euro;948.8m which includes an additional &euro;10m to alleviate the problem of delayed discharges in acute hospital settings. This increase will allow for the provision of an additional 300 long stay care places under the NHSS and has reduced the wait time for funding under the Scheme from circa 15 weeks to 11 weeks now.</p>  <p>  The HSE is doing everything possible to relieve the current pressures on acute hospitals, including relocating patients from acute settings to transitional care where this is possible. Additional funding of &euro;8m has been provided this year through which an additional 50 transitional care/rehab beds have been allocated to acute hospitals and an additional 65 beds will come on stream on a phased basis from March 2015 through the commissioning of the former Mount Carmel Hospital.</p>  <p>  The review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently in progress will include consideration of the balance between community and residential services as well as the future financing and sustainability of the Scheme. Work on this review is well advanced and will be published in the coming months.</p></reply>

These are wide-ranging and boost the bi-lateral relationship across a wide array of sectors.  In the past ten years, the following MOUs have been signed:</p>  <p> On 9 December 2014, while accompanying the President on his State Visit to China, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding on a Framework for Jointly Enhancing People to People Exchanges and Co-Operation with the Chinese People&rsquo;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.  This MOU seeks to enhance research, education and technology links between Ireland and China.  The MOU will support closer ties between cities in Ireland and China, as well as provincial and county ties.  It is designed to promote joint research between Irish and Chinese universities and increase cooperation in education, science, technology, entrepreneurship as well as in agricultural, cultural and design fields.  Exchanges between schools and youth groups from both countries will be encouraged. </p>  <p>  This MOU builds on the Strategic Partnership for Mutually Beneficial Cooperation which was signed by the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny T.D., on 28 March 2012.</p>  <p>  In June 2014, Minister Jimmy Deenihan T.D. in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht signed an MOU on the establishment of a China Cultural Centre in Ireland. </p>  <p>  On 16 April 2012, during his visit to China, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Simon Coveney T.D. signed three MOUs with China, namely: an MOU on sanitary and phyto-sanitary issues, including the setting up of a working group on market access on beef; an MOU on mutual cooperation in the agri-food and fisheries areas; MOU on the export of horse feed to China; and an MOU on renewal of Bovine Semen Protocol facilitating the export of Bovine semen to China. </p>  <p>  Three MOUs with China were signed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Richard Bruton T.D. in 2012:  On 27 March 2012, an MOU on Scientific Innovation Cooperation and on 19 February 2012, he signed an MOU for the promotion of Trade in Internationally Traded Services and an MOU on the Establishment of a Joint Investment Promotion Working Group.</p>  <p>  In March 2010, the then Minister of State for Trade and Commerce, Billy Kelleher T.D., signed an MOU on Economic Cooperation. An MOU on Cultural Cooperation and Exchange was signed by Mary Hanafin T.D., the then Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. Lastly, an MOU on a Joint Working Group on Education was signed by the then Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science, Brigid McManus.</p>  <p>  On 23 October 2008, two MOUs with China were agreed.  The first was an MOU establishing an arrangement for the sharing of supervisory information and the enhancing of cooperation in the area of banking supervision, signed by the then Chairman of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, Jim Farrell.  A second MOU regarding Securities and Futures Regulatory Cooperation was also signed by Mr Farrell on this date. </p>  <p>  The then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Mary Coughlan T.D., signed a Protocol on veterinary and health requirements for pork to be exported from Ireland to China, on 18 January 2005.</p>  <p>  An MOU with China was signed by Mr. Paul Bates, Assistant Secretary at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism (as it then was) in 2004 on Visa and Related Issues concerning Tourist Groups from the People's Republic of China.</p></reply>

As noted in my press statement of 18 December 2014, this is a positive step towards the normalisation of relations between the two countries.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the US economic, commercial and financial measures against Cuba are long-standing and clear.  Ireland and the other member states of the European Union are firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the island&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people.  In addition, we and our EU partners do not believe that the continued embargo contributes in a positive way to the democratic transition in Cuba.  We have expressed this position in our support for the relevant resolutions at the UN General Assembly, most recently on 28 October last year.  We have recorded also our strong opposition to the extraterritorial application of the legislation giving effect to the embargo.    The Deputy will be aware that the US embargo against Cuba is codified in legislation passed by Congress.  President Obama has indicated his willingness to engage with Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo.  We welcome the President&rsquo;s efforts in this regard also. </p>  <p>  The recent UN debate recorded continued concerns and criticisms regarding governance and human rights in Cuba.  It was noted that while the US embargo has a damaging effect on the Cuban economy, domestic Cuban economic policy seriously hampers its own economic development.  Together with our EU partners we have urged that the package of economic and social reforms adopted by the Cuban Parliament in August 2011 be extended and implemented in a manner that will address the key concerns of the Cuban population. </p>  <p>  I urge the Cuban authorities to bring about real improvements in all areas mentioned, and to grant its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s support to UNV in recent years has focused on sponsoring the deployment of UNV Youth volunteers (recent graduates) and UNV Specialists (experienced professionals) to assignments with UN agencies primarily in Irish Aid&rsquo;s partner countries and priority sectors.</p>  <p>  Youth volunteer placements are usually for 12 months, and provide the volunteers with the opportunity to develop and apply their skills, knowledge and capacities.  In 2014 Irish Aid&rsquo;s support to the UNV Programme directly led to the deployment of 14 UN Youth Volunteers with UN Agencies.  This year Irish Aid will support the placement of 10 Youth Volunteers.  The UN Specialist Volunteers placements are for a period of 24 months, mainly in Irish Aid programme countries.  In 2014, two Specialist Volunteers were directly funded by Irish Aid and placed with UN Agencies.</p>  <p>  UNV also maintains a database of candidates interested in volunteering which it uses to fill volunteer positions with UN agencies in developing countries.  Through Ireland&rsquo;s continued support to the UNV programme Irish citizens are chosen by UNV from their database to fill specialist volunteer assignments.  Irish Aid also directly supports UNV to deploy Specialists to UN offices in developing countries.</p>  <p>  In relation to the EU, my Department contributes to the funding of the Junior Professionals in Delegations (JPD) programme run by the European External Action Service and the European Commission, under which four Irish citizens last year secured extended paid traineeships in EU delegations.   The Department is also an active stakeholder in the EU Jobs campaign, coordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach, which provides a range of services to advise Irish citizens about current recruitment opportunities in the EU institutions and which supports them through the application process.</p></reply>

This assistance is delivered through the Department&rsquo;s network of diplomatic missions abroad and through the Department&rsquo;s Consular Division based in Dublin.     The Department&rsquo;s website also has detailed country-specific travel advice to assist citizens in planning their travel and acquainting them with particular issues they should bear in mind when travelling to particular places.</p>  <p>  The Consular Assistance provided by the Department includes providing emergency and other official documents to citizens, and liaising with local authorities on behalf of a citizen or their family, especially in cases where there may be language barriers. Depending on the circumstances of the difficulty encountered by the citizen, we can also provide information on legal experts, medical facilities and other such locally based services that may be required.  </p>  <p>  In 2014, the Department provided assistance in 221 cases involving a death abroad. In cases where the Department is notified of the death of an Irish national abroad, the Department will offer the deceased&rsquo;s next-of-kin assistance in liaising with relevant local authorities and organisations as they seek to repatriate their loved one&rsquo;s remains to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Whilst the Department provides a highly accessible consular service, given the number of people travelling abroad it is not possible for budgetary reasons for the Department to fund repatriations in the case of death abroad.  The Department strongly recommends to citizens that they purchase suitable travel insurance prior to undertaking their travels, so that they can pay for medical bills and other additional costs as may be required, up to and including the repatriation of remains.</p></reply>

This is a service which my Department provides so that the media can easily and freely avail of photography where their own staff photographers cannot be fully accommodated.  Events such as the visit of State Visit of Queen Elizabeth, the Global Irish Economic Forum and the Presidential Distinguished Service Awards resulted in positive coverage of Ireland.  In September 2011, my Department led a collaborative advertised tender process for the procurement of a multi-supplier competitive framework of photographic service providers.  This is now available for use by all Government Departments.  Details of the framework arrangements and the photographers used are posted on the National Procurement Service website: .  The purpose of this framework is to ensure Departments&rsquo; compliance with EU procurement rules and to ensure value for money by having a competitive process for photographic assignments.  In addition, my Department now makes greater use of in-house resources for photography, including, for example, at the Irish-Africa Economic Forum in October.  <br/><br/>The total cost of photography to my Department over the period in question is &euro;161,493.37.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>60,661.53</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>38,150.98</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>35,554.34</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>27,126.52</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>161,493.37</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The table below indicates the cost associated with particular events.<table><tr><th>Expenditure</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>Expenditure at Missons*</td><td>34,167.51</td></tr><tr><td>Credential Ceremonies </td><td>30,332.54</td></tr><tr><td>State Visit of Queen Elizabeth II</td><td>22,662.70</td></tr><tr><td>Official visit by Chinese Vice President</td><td>7,321.58</td></tr><tr><td>State visit Prince Albert of Monaco</td><td>6,213.35</td></tr><tr><td>OSCE Ministerial Council</td><td>4,786.55</td></tr><tr><td>Visit of President of Mozambique</td><td>3,102.50</td></tr><tr><td>Official Visit to New York and Washington Minister</td><td>2,683.78</td></tr><tr><td>Official Visit  by Japanese Prime Minister</td><td>2,555.94</td></tr><tr><td>Official Visit  by Canadian Prime Minister</td><td>2,553.36</td></tr><tr><td>Official visit by the King and Queen of Lesotho</td><td>2,473.14</td></tr><tr><td>Official Visit  to Mozambique, Malawi &amp;amp; Tanzania</td><td>2,388.30</td></tr><tr><td>Global Irish Economic Forum 2013</td><td>2,175.20</td></tr><tr><td>Diplomatic Corp New Years Greeting</td><td>2,015.97</td></tr><tr><td>Global Irish Economic Forum</td><td>1,923.90</td></tr><tr><td>Inauguration of President Higgins</td><td>1,817.30</td></tr><tr><td>OSCE Event Lessons Learned from Northern Ireland</td><td>1,479.35</td></tr><tr><td>Visit of Thai Royal Family</td><td>1,377.60</td></tr><tr><td>Launch of Our World Awards</td><td>1,268.05</td></tr><tr><td>African Ireland Economic Forum 2011</td><td>1,220.59</td></tr><tr><td>Presidential Distinguished Service Awards 2013</td><td>1,074.20</td></tr><tr><td>Our World Irish Aid Awards (National and Regional)</td><td>942.18</td></tr><tr><td>Hati Photographic exhibition</td><td>919.9</td></tr><tr><td>Presidential Distinguished Service Awards 2014</td><td>841</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Aid Centre Education materials</td><td>741.8</td></tr><tr><td>Science for Development Award at BT Young Scientist</td><td>711.71</td></tr><tr><td>National Ploughing Championship </td><td>687</td></tr><tr><td>Launch of Commemoration Lecture</td><td>658.82</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Aid - One World One Future</td><td>637.14</td></tr><tr><td>Official Visit to Kenya</td><td>606.4</td></tr><tr><td>Official Visit by Indian Minister</td><td>599.75</td></tr><tr><td>2010 Irish Aid Annual report</td><td>596</td></tr><tr><td>Schools Awareness Programmes</td><td>561</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Aid Awards 2014</td><td>560.88</td></tr><tr><td>Launch of EU Presidency Logo</td><td>560.84</td></tr><tr><td>Visit of Scottish Minister Hyslop</td><td>551.04</td></tr><tr><td>Launch of Africa Day 2011 - Dublin</td><td>526.35</td></tr><tr><td>Official farewell for the British Ambassador</td><td>524.84</td></tr><tr><td>Meeting of EU Development Ministers</td><td>521.19</td></tr><tr><td>Reconciliation Forum</td><td>516.6</td></tr><tr><td>Western Balkans Conference</td><td>482.16</td></tr><tr><td>Africa Day 2013</td><td>478.45</td></tr><tr><td>Visit of Elders</td><td>430.5</td></tr><tr><td>OSCE 5+2 Conference</td><td>417.76</td></tr><tr><td>Visit of Congressman Morrison</td><td>412.05</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Aid Zero Hunger Event</td><td>398.46</td></tr><tr><td>Visit of Aung Sang Suu Kyi</td><td>393.92</td></tr><tr><td>Official visit of US Congressional Delegation</td><td>388.62</td></tr><tr><td>Hunger Envoy's Report</td><td>379.33</td></tr><tr><td>Unveiling of W.B.

Although it has been our practice not to engage the services of external public relations firms, we have from time to time commissioned consultants or companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.  DHR Communications is the only company which has been contracted since 2010, to manage and administer grants under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and Africa Day celebrations.  The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year and managing the SCMF student competition.  This typically involves the following activities:<br/><br/>- Convening national and regional information workshops;<br/><br/>- Managing and administering the application process;<br/><br/>- Organising the judging process;<br/><br/>- Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;<br/><br/>- Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;<br/><br/>- Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  <br/><br/>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund. This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  DHR was awarded a two-year contract to 2012 and was re-engaged in February 2012 for a further two years following a competitive tendering process.  The contract was extended in 2014 for a further year.<br/><br/>Following a competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin. This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This public awareness work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.<br/><br/>Africa Day Family Days were hosted by the Department in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010, in CHQ in Georges Dock in 2012 and at the Farmleigh Estate in 2013 and 2014. In 2011, the Department supported a series of smaller-scale performances, family events, art exhibitions, debates and educational activities instead of hosting a flagship event. <br/><br/>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below.  This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.<br/><br/>DHR also provided short-term management support services for the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, including the logistical management of the nationwide public consultation activities.<br/><br/>The table below sets out the payments to DHR since 2011.  <br/><br/><b>Payments to DHR Communication for Project and Event Management 2011 to 2014</b><table><tr><th>Name of Project/Event</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>SCMF</td><td>&euro;73,237</td><td>&euro;47,430</td><td>&euro;73,836</td><td>&euro;60,338</td></tr><tr><td>White Paper Review</td><td>&euro;25,000</td><td>&euro;26,026</td><td>nil</td><td>nil</td></tr><tr><td>Africa Day</td><td>&euro;6,806</td><td>&euro;90,851</td><td>&euro;118,644</td><td>&euro;143,829</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>&euro;105,043</td><td>&euro;164,307</td><td>&euro;192,480</td><td>&euro;204,167</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, it could not be finalised for passport issue under the Passports Act, 2008 on the grounds that his entitlement to Irish citizenship had not been demonstrated.  The Department wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s mother on three occasions about the application.  The key points of this correspondence were:<br/><br/>(i) citizenship entitlement is based on s.6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended.  This requires three years actual lawful residence on the part of the child&rsquo;s mother within a four year period preceding the child&rsquo;s date of birth;<br/><br/>(ii) the evidence submitted by her only established reckonable residence (for the purposes of section 6A of the Act) for her from June, 2010 to January, 2012.  The amount of her reckonable residence did not meet the statutory requirement of three years;<br/><br/>(iii) further evidence of the mother&rsquo;s residence from February, 2008 to May 2010 was needed  to finalise her son&rsquo;s application.  She was requested to provide this evidence.  She was advised of the range of evidence that was acceptable to the Department for this purpose.  This includes:<br/><br/>(a) tax records (i.e. P60s and/or P45s);<br/><br/>(b) Original copies of rent leases or bank mortgage repayments;<br/><br/>(c) employment pay slips; or<br/><br/>(d) record of social welfare benefit payments.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Middle East is home to the some of the world&rsquo;s most ancient Christian denominations. However, the violence and instability of recent years across the region has had a negative impact on many minority groups in the region, including Christians, with many of them reported to have left the region. </p><p>  The European Union supports the protection of fundamental rights for all communities across the wider Middle East and throughout the world. This is reflected in the relevant Council Conclusions from FAC meetings where the EU has consistently voiced its unequivocal concern for the plight of vulnerable groups, including religious minorities, being targeted by extremists, and has strongly condemned acts of violence targeted towards religious and other minorities. </p><p>  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, I can assure the Deputy that we attach great importance to the fundamental rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief. However, in situations of open conflict neither we nor the EU have any means to offer direct physical protection to populations located in combat zones. Whenever possible, we raise the issue of the safety of Christians and other religious minorities with the national governments through the appropriate bilateral and multilateral channels and consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of all minority groups. I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon. </p><p>  In cases such as Syria and Iraq, where the collapse of national government authority across large areas has been a key factor leading to the problem, the restoration of control by broadly accepted authorities is a critical prerequisite for safeguarding minority communities.</p></reply>

The Stormont House Agreement covers a broad range of political, social and economic issues and has the potential to advance significantly its twin aims of reconciliation and economic renewal.  It sets out a plan for financial and budgetary reform.  It proposes a way forward on flags, identity, culture and tradition through the establishment of a commission. It envisages the devolution of responsibility for parades to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It establishes a programme of institutional reform at Stormont and progresses a number of outstanding aspects from the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreements.   Very significantly, it establishes a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the legacy of the Past. This framework includes an oral history archive; a dedicated independent Historical Investigations Unit which will investigate Troubles-related deaths; and an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval to enable victims and survivors, North and South, to seek and receive information about the death of their loved ones.</p><p>  As is the case with all participants in the talks, there were a number of additional issues which the Government would have wished to see progressed further but there was not sufficient consensus among the parties at this time.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding that it was included in a paper tabled by the Government at the outset of the talks, we were disappointed that a commitment to an Irish Language Act, either enacted in Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly, did not form part of the final Agreement.  We welcome, however, the explicit endorsement in the Agreement by the British Government of the principle of respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.   </p><p>  Similarly, while the Government would have wished to see the establishment of a North South Consultative Forum and a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, the necessary enabling consensus was not forthcoming during the Stormont talks.  The Government will nevertheless avail of other opportunities to secure progress on these outstanding issues.</p><p>  The months of the negotiations involved a huge commitment from both Governments and from all of the parties concerned.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is conscious of our responsibilities to all of the people of this island.   In the months ahead, we will continue to advance political progress and to play our part in the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement. To this end, I will be attending the first quarterly meeting to review progress on implementation of the Agreement later this month.</p></reply>

In relation to the particular outstanding matters raised by the Deputy, the following is the position.</p><p>  During the course of the talks, the Government advanced the view that a Bill of Rights could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based. Sufficient consensus between the Northern Ireland Executive Parties did not exist to take this forward within the context of the Stormont House Agreement. However, the final Agreement provided that the parties commit to serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the obligations on government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination; to promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and mutual understanding at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage shared and integrated education and housing, social inclusion, and in particular community development and the advancement of women in public life;  and to promote the interests of the whole community towards the goals of reconciliation and economic renewal.</p><p>  It is a matter of regret that agreement could not be reached on an Irish Language Act as part of the Stormont House Agreement.  While the St. Andrews Agreement did provide a commitment to introduce an Irish Language Act, the British Government made it clear during the recent talks that, as language matters were now devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, it would not legislate at Westminster for such an Act. It was equally clear that the necessary consensus among the parties for such legislation in the Northern Ireland Assembly was not forthcoming. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the Stormont House Agreement does contain an important and formal recognition by the British and Irish Government of the need for respect for, and recognition of, the Irish language in Northern Ireland.    An Irish Language Act remains an outstanding matter.  The Government will continue to advocate for its enactment and to encourage those Northern Ireland parties which currently support an Act to continue to build the necessary enabling consensus among their Executive colleagues.</p><p>  In line with the Good Friday Agreement, a Northern Ireland Civic Forum was set up in October 2000 but was suspended, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly, in 2002. Following the restoration of devolved powers in May 2007, the then First Minister and deputy First Minister considered the position of the Civic Forum in the re-established devolved arrangements and commissioned a review of the effectiveness and appropriateness of its structure, operation and membership.   </p><p>  The Government believe that greater civic engagement would stimulate informed public debate in Northern Ireland in relation to key societal challenges. This was the position put forward by the Government in the recent Stormont House talks.   I welcome that the Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a civic advisory panel to meet regularly on key social, cultural and economic issues and to advise the Northern Ireland Executive.  </p><p>  The Government will continue its efforts to ensure that the full potential of the Agreements is realised towards achieving effective partnership government, genuine reconciliation between divided communities and economic prosperity for all in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians.<br/><br/>Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.<br/><br/>Where possible, Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities. We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.<br/><br/>Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address<i></i>the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.<br/><br/>The EU leads resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at both the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and at the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, of which Ireland is currently a member. Ireland is an active participant in the negotiation of these resolutions.  In 2014, the EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief were successfully adopted without a vote by the HRC (March 2014) and by the UN General Assembly during its 69th session (December 2014).  Ireland also raised concerns in relation to persecution on the basis of religion or belief in interactive dialogues with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion during the 69th session of the Third Committee in 2014. <br/><br/>The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a unique peer review mechanism whereby the human rights records of individual states are reviewed in the UN Human Rights Council.  Ireland is an active participant in the UPR, and where applicable, raises concerns in relation to persecution on the basis of religion or belief during the dialogue with states under review.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

At the HRC, Ireland has actively participated in the negotiations of, and co-sponsored, resolutions on the elimination of discrimination against women; violence against women; female genital mutilation (FGM); preventable maternal mortality and morbidity; realising the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl; and strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage.<br/><br/>The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a unique peer review mechanism whereby the human rights records of individual states are reviewed in the UN Human Rights Council.  Ireland is an active participant in the UPR, and regularly raises concerns in relation to the promotion of women&rsquo;s rights and equality.<br/><br/>The protection and fulfilment of women&rsquo;s human rights is also a priority for Ireland at the UN Third Committee, which deals with social, humanitarian and human rights issues.  At the Third Committee, Ireland has led negotiations for the EU on resolutions on women human rights defenders, and on trafficking in women and girls.  <br/><br/>As part of our commitment to advancing gender equality, Ireland played a key role in the establishment of UN Women, and is an active participant in the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), which is the principal global policy-making body on gender equality and the advancement of women.  Ireland presented its candidature in November 2014 to one of the seats on the CSW for the term 2018 &ndash; 2022. If elected, this will be the first time that Ireland has served on the Commission, and will enhance our commitment to the promotion of gender equality.<br/><br/>Ireland has also been a strong advocate of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security and has taken a leadership role in the international arena calling on other states to commit to implementation of this resolution. The resolution calls for an increase in the participation of women in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes; the protection of women and girls in armed conflict; and the incorporation of a gender perspective into peacekeeping and peacebuilding processes.  In 2011 Ireland adopted its first National Action Plan on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1325 for 2011-2014. This Plan has been recognised as a model of best practice internationally in terms of civil society involvement in drafting and monitoring.<br/><br/>Today, I was very pleased to launch Ireland&rsquo;s second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (2015-2018). The Plan outlines the steps Ireland will take in order to ameliorate the unique adverse effect of conflict on women and girls, and to increase the empowerment and participation of women in decision-making in conflict and post-conflict situations. <br/><br/>Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are priorities in our official development assistance programme.  All recipients of Irish Aid funding are required to demonstrate their commitment to these goals. Both bilaterally in our engagement with partner countries, and at the UN and in other multilateral bodies, we consistently emphasise the importance of gender mainstreaming as a key aspect of ending poverty, hunger, discrimination and vulnerability across the globe.<br/><br/>Currently, the final phase of the post-2015 negotiations on a new framework for global development is getting underway at the United Nations.  Those negotiations will produce a set of Sustainable Development Goals which are expected not only to continue the effort to eliminate extreme poverty but also address areas of climate, governance, consumption and production and economic growth and be universally applicable to all countries. Ireland has been consistent in the post-2015 negotiations to date on the need for a strong goal on gender equality and women's empowerment, as well as effective mainstreaming across all other goals, targets and indicators.  Such a goal would reflect the renewed commitment to fulfilling our obligations to dismantle the structural underpinnings of gender inequality, transform gender relations and effect positive change in the lives of all women and girls. We are also prioritising an end to gender-based violence, which remains the most pervasive yet least recognized human rights abuse in the world.<font color="#004080"> </font><br/><br/>In 2008, the EU adopted guidelines on violence against women and girls and combating all forms of discrimination against them.  The EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy was adopted in 2012 and states that the protection of the rights of women and protection against gender-based violence is a clear priority for the EU. The EU also regularly raises abuse of the rights of women in human rights dialogues with third countries and gives support to civil society initiatives which tackle gender-based violence and feminicide.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to advocate for the respect, protection and fulfilment of women&rsquo;s human rights worldwide.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p><p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about her educational progress I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

This includes the standard learning/language support allocation that is given to all schools and the additional support that is provided to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language support.<br/><br/>Further additional temporary language support posts are provided on the basis of appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards. The appeal criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.<br/><br/>Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between language support and learning support depending on the specific needs of the school. <br/><br/>The staffing arrangements for the 2015/16 school year will be published shortly and this will enable schools to determine their staffing levels for that school year.<br/><br/>The Teaching Council's criteria for Initial Teacher Education (ITE) sets out the mandatory elements to be contained in all Initial Teacher Education Programmes. These include Inclusive Education, (Special Education, Multiculturalism, Disadvantage, etc) Literacy, Numeracy and Differentiation. The Council's criteria does not overly prescribe what should be covered in programmes, rather, the approach is that ITE is about the development of critical core skills, which can then be applied to any range of issues in the classroom, possibly with the benefit of further up-skilling post-qualification.<br/><br/>The Professional Development Service for Teachers offer workshops and school support in the area of EAL to primary schools. The purpose of the workshops is to provide key information on EAL to both language support teachers and teachers supporting children with EAL under the general allocation model. At post-primary level, support is made available to schools on request in the area of EAL and work on literacy incorporates aspects of EAL in many cases.</p></reply>

These secondments are subject to annual review. The arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the in-service needs of teachers and other support priorities of the school system can be met within the resources available. </p><p>  Having teachers with relevant and recent teaching experience and expertise is a key requirement for the role. It is a condition therefore that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is five years, following which they return to their teaching roles in their schools. In this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system. Each education centre has a management committee and staff which ensures continuity at a local level. The teacher secondment arrangements were disseminated extensively so the necessary planning could take place at all levels including education centres, support services, school boards of management and individual teacher. Implementation of the arrangements is now well advanced.  Accordingly, there are no plans to change the policy of the five year limit.</p><p>  I am aware that a number of education centre directors will reach their five year limit in August 2015.  Some alleviation was agreed to allow a small number to serve beyond that date for a limited period and there has been consultations with the directors in this regard.   My Department continues to be open to considering any proposal within the policy parameters outlined above.</p></reply>

SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  Schools who wish to make an application for additional SNA support may make such an application to the NCSE. </p><p>  Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie. </p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

SOLAS was established on 27 October 2013 and funded for the remainder of the year from the residual F&Aacute;S budget.  SOLAS has a current full time equivalent staffing of 211.</p><p>  Under the Public Service Reform plan a number of bodies were merged as follows.</p><p>  The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences were merged in March 2012 to form the Irish Research Council (IRC). The IRC has been established as a sub-board of the Higher Education Authority (HEA). Its function is to award research funding, primarily for postgraduate students and early-career postdoctoral researchers. The establishment of the IRC will result in an estimated saving of &euro;100,000 on an annual basis. </p><p>  Under the provisions of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) were amalgamated to form a new agency, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). QQI's functions are set out in Section 9 of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012. These include the development of awards and standards, review of education and training providers, development of quality assurance, validation of programmes, maintenance of the National Framework of Qualifications and facilitation of qualification recognition. The estimated saving following the merger is &euro;1 million on annual basis. </p><p>  Under the provisions of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have replaced 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs). The functions of ETBs are set out in Section 10 of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013. Following re-configuration of the VECs, the number of Chief Executive Officer posts have been reduced from 33 to 16.  This change has resulted in full year savings of the order of &euro;1.9m. Further savings are likely to be achieved through the realisation of economies of scale arising from the mergers and the wider Education and Training Sector Reform Programme.</p></reply>

Videoconferencing facilities have been in place in my Department's offices for a number of years, enabling staff in two or more locations communicate by simultaneous video and audio transmissions.  In addition during 2013, my Department rolled out unified communications software across the three main offices in Dublin, Athlone and Tullamore and a number of regional/local offices, with plans to extend to other such offices in 2014.  This software facilitates desktop video conferencing and desktop sharing, enabling colleagues in different locations work on the same document.  These technologies reduce the time and cost associated with business travel and enable a more efficient way of working.  It is however inevitable that senior officials in particular would be required to attend meetings away from their base such as Interdepartmental meetings, Ministerial meetings etc.<br/><br/>In respect of Agencies under the aegis of my Department:-The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) decentralised 12 staff to Portlaoise in August 2008.

My Department, at that stage, may allocate resources towards an education component of such provision. This is generally transacted through the co-operation hours scheme operated by Education and Training Boards (ETBs). Funding is also provided to Vocational Training Centres and the National Learning Network for this purpose.</p><p>  Special Schools are staffed in accordance with arrangements set out in my Department's Circular 0042/2011, which provides for enhanced pupil teacher ratios for pupils attending Special Schools ranging from 6-1, to 12-1, on the basis of disability categorisation of pupils attending the school. </p><p>  The course to which the Deputy has referred in his question is a post school Further Education and Training course.</p><p>  In general, my Department funds Further Education and Training programmes through SOLAS, the new Further Education and Training Authority. These programmes are mainly provided locally through the Education and Training Boards (ETB). </p><p>  As such, the correspondent should contact their local Education and Training Board in relation to their matter. </p></reply>

It recognises and rewards skills which cannot readily be assessed through externally assessed written final examinations.  It encourages teachers to collaborate and provides a forum for discussing and sharing good practice and resources that enhance the quality learning and teaching.</p><p>  School based assessment enables teachers to shine a light on the unique talents and skills of students, it enables teachers to differentiate the learning, tailoring it to the unique ways and needs of their students. School-based assessment leads to the setting of more meaningful tasks that relate directly to what is learnt.  Ultimately it creates opportunities for the student to succeed. School-based assessment enables students to make considered decisions about their work, in natural and comfortable conditions and in their own time. This helps students to illustrate what they know and are capable of achieving in normal conditions.  It allows for a much more rounded picture of student achievement to emerge.</p><p>  In the context of an external examination, many teachers have experiences of their best students or a student that has worked exceptionally hard receiving a grade that is neither representative of their ability nor indicative of their potential. This grade, a once off judgement, fails to capture the richness of that student's contributions to class discussions, their willingness to help less-abled students, the hours they spent putting projects together, their ability to ask challenging questions and to engage critically. It fails to do justice to the three years of hard work, commitment and dedication that the student exemplified.  It concentrates on the performance in one exam rather than on the process of learning.</p><p>  An external terminal exam, such as the Junior Certificate, can impact not only on students' learning but also on the way teachers' teach.  It can lead to teaching to the rest.  An external terminal exam takes place at the end of a period of learning and only provides limited information about students' competences when they have already finished the Junior cycle Programme.</p><p>  The benefits of having teachers assess their own students' work, is based on a range of international research findings.  Assessment should assist students in the quality of their learning and not be regarded as the end point. Assessment is not about &quot;proving&quot; but about &quot;improving&quot; learning outcomes. Research shows that unless assessment changes, nothing else will.</p><p>  My November proposal includes a combination of both types of assessment.  There will be a final exam worth 60% and 40% will be awarded for school based assessment.  The State Examination Commission will check 10-15% of the school based assessment to ensure consistency and fairness.</p></reply>

Not all of the allowances listed were available to every teacher as entitlement was based on the qualifications held by the individual and/or the nature of the post for which they were employed.<br/><br/>Teacher salaries increased between 2005 and 2009 as the result of various public service productivity agreements. Due to the worsening economic circumstances, the Government introduced a pay reduction for all public servants (including teachers) with effect from 1 January 2010 under the financial emergency measures legislation.<br/><br/>Subsequently, the Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale. Prior to this, teachers entered on the second or third point of the salary scale as they were entitled to incremental credit in respect of their professional training.<br/><br/>Arising from the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012. As part of this, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<br/><br/>Under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 &ndash; 2016 (Haddington Road Agreement), revised payscales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented with effect from 1 July 2013.<br/><br/>The Haddington Road Agreement further provided that the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date would be addressed. In that regard, my Department implemented a further revised incremental salary scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with effect from 1 November 2013. Allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and those allowances which remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels as part of this measure. <table><tr><th>TEACHERS'<br /><br />COMMON BASIC SCALE </th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Scale Point</td><td>1/6/05</td><td>1/12/05</td><td>1/6/06</td><td>1/12/06</td><td>1/6/07</td><td>1/3/08</td><td>1/9/08</td><td>1/1/10</td><td>Post-1/1/11 New Entrants to teaching - 1/1/11 to 30/6/13 (Note a)</td><td>Post-1/1/11 New Entrants to teaching - 1/7/13 to 31/10/13 (Note b)</td><td>Post 1/1/11 New Entrants to teaching - 1/11/13 onwards (Note c)</td><td>Post 1/2/12 New Entrants to teaching - 1/2/12 to 30/6/13  (Note d)</td><td>Post 1/2/12 New Entrants to teaching - 1/7/13 onwards(Note e)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>&euro;

Where children have significant care needs to the extent that they need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.<br/><br/>The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.<br/><br/>All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year by 26 March 2014. The NCSE published details of their allocations for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year in June 2014. The NCSE completed a second round allocations for SNA provision for the 2014/15 school year in October 2014, details of which are available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to each school, including schools Ballymun, are available on the NCSE website.<br/><br/>The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <br/><br/>Should a school wish to make an application for additional SNA support for a child who was not previously considered for SNA support, or who is due to enrol in a school, they may do so to the NCSE. Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Only the school that the pupil attends and a small number of Department staff will have access to an account. No agency or other Government Department will have access to the Primary Online Database.The Department proposes in the future to share some of the personal data stored on POD with other State bodies. These are: - Central Statistics Office, under the Statistics Acts to assist with the compilation of national statistics. - The National Council for Special Education, under the Education Welfare Act, in order to assist in supporting resource allocation in relation to pupils with special educational needs. - The Child and Family Agency, under the Education Welfare Act, to ensure that each child of compulsory school age is in receipt of an education. - To meet the Department's business needs in regard to the allocation of resources to schools, the Department will share a limited amount of each pupil's personal data, including a child's PPS number with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform PPSN validation service, or directly with the Department of Social Protection Client Identity Database area, in order to validate the identity of each pupil and ensure that the correct resource allocation is granted to each school.</p><p>  The Department will put in place a data user agreement with each of these bodies, which includes the purpose for which the body requires the data, its storage, security and retention. The current retention policy for Primary Online Database (POD) data is for records to be maintained for the longer of either the period up to the pupil's 30th Birthday or for a period of ten years since the student was last enrolled in a primary school.  In future schools will no longer be required to keep the Cl&aacute;rleabhar therefore POD will be the official register of pupils in schools and data will be retained to allow pupils to obtain their records in the future. The Department's retention policy is for audit and accounting purposes as pupils' data is used in the allocation of teaching posts and funding to schools. The policy also serves to trace retention trends in the education system, is important for longitudinal research and policy formation, as well as being an important statistical indicator nationally and internationally. Aggregate and not individual data is used for the majority of these purposes.  This retention policy has been agreed with the Data Protection Commissioner and the Department is continually reviewing its retention policy for pupil data in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p>  The notes area on POD was suggested by the management bodies for schools that will use POD as their only administrative system for information which is required at school level only. This information does not transfer with the pupil to another school and once POD is fully operational this area will not be visible to Department users. Under no circumstances are the additional comments available to Departments, agencies or anyone outside of the pupil's current school.</p></reply>

However, those who do meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. </p><p>  A postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2014/15 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents. </p><p>  Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees.

In addition to this, the Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.</p><p>  For students, affordability is just one of a number of factors that impact on participation rates in higher education. There are a range of wider factors that also impact on participation, including social and cultural issues, prior academic attainment and teacher and parental expectations. In access terms, it is considered that the requirement to pay postgraduate tuition fees would be likely to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support.</p><p>  This year my Department is providing over &euro;31 million to support research activities across a range of programmes by the Irish Research Council. The schemes specifically focus on providing funding support to postgraduate students and early-career post-doctoral fellows.

The primary purpose of POD will be to monitor the educational progress of primary pupils (in DES aided schools), throughout the primary system and onwards to post primary level and to help them develop their full educational potential. Once up and running other secondary purposes of POD will include becoming the basis for the allocation of teachers and capitation grants.  Aggregated POD data will also be used for the production and publication of primary level statistics.  A PPS number is an individual's unique identification number for all dealings with the Public Service, including Social Welfare, tax, education and health services.  Having the PPSN on the database will help ensure that there are no duplicate records in the system i.e that two schools do not have the same child on their roll. In the future we will be able to track pupils from early childhood education, to primary school and onto post-primary, which will allow us to ensure that every child in the State of compulsory school age is in education.  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, Section 262 allows for the collection of the PPSN by schools and the Department of Education and Skills:Section 262 of the Act states (4) A person shall give to a specified body his or her personal public service number and the personal public service numbers of his or her spouse and children, where relevant, as required by the body for the purposes of the person's transaction.  (6) (a) Where a specified body has a transaction with a person, the Minister may share the person's public service identity with the specified body to the extent necessary for authentication by the specified body of the person's public service identity.

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department's website.  In accordance with these rules, each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  At post-primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short-term support, i.e., curricular concessions.  The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The appeal procedures are set out in the published staffing arrangements.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998, as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012.  The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance matters for the school management authorities.</p><p>  We have a growing population of young people in this country.  Despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we have prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has grown to protect pupil-teacher ratios. Between this year and last year, this has involved an increase of approximately 2,300 teachers in our primary and post-primary schools.  This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.</p><p>  While there has been a moratorium on recruitment across other sectors in the public service, this has not applied to teaching.  This shows the commitment this Government has to educating our future generations.  The main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels within the education system.</p><p>  Arrangements for the staffing and redeployment process for the 2015-16 school year are under way in my Department.  The staffing arrangements for the 2015-16 school year will be published on the Department's website shortly.  The final staffing position for all schools at post-primary level will ultimately not be known until the autumn.  At that stage, the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p></reply>

These payrolls have become increasingly complex over the past five years, due to the introduction of three salary scales and two sets of allowances, by comparison to a single salary scale and set of allowances for all teachers prior to 2010; the introduction of the Universal Social Charge, the Pension-Related Deduction and the single pension scheme; the Implementation of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001; and the new sick leave regulations for schools and employees, etc.</p><p>  In addition, school employee payrolls have a high volume of substitute and casual appointments for payment, which is not a feature of comparable major payrolls for Civil Servants, the Army and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na etc.  Work is ongoing to incorporate payments to home tutors through the payroll, which will broaden the range of payees coming within the remit of the school employee payrolls.</p><p>  Accordingly, the development of the software to implement the Haddington Road Agreement in the context of the overall numbers being paid on the payroll, including substitute and casual appointees), the payroll complexities referenced above and the complexity of the agreement itself has been a very difficult and complex task.</p><p>  The Department's software provider was engaged on 17 July 2014 to develop software for the deferral of increments for school employees and advised that the software needed to be available for testing by 1 September 2014 and implementation on the live payrolls by 15 September 2014.  As this was a complex development, there was a number of subsequent communications with the software provider to clarify various aspects of the specification.</p><p>  The software was delivered for testing on 16 October 2014.  Due to the complexity of the system and the number and range of employees, all software enhancements have to be robustly tested to ensure there is no adverse impact on any aspect of the overall payroll operation.  A further complication in this instance was the requirement to test this software in conjunction with other software to calculate or recalculate Haddington Road Agreement allowances taking account of the impact of increments and allowances for those reaching &euro;65,000.  The testing of this software to defer increments took longer than originally anticipated and was not completed in time for the payroll issues in December 2014.  As the software was initially developed to process employees due a deferred increment in the payroll period being processed, further software was needed to process employees due deferred increments from December 2014.   The Department's software provider was engaged on 19 December 2014 to provide this additional software, which was delivered for user acceptance testing on 8 January 2015.  This software is currently undergoing robust testing with target dates for the payment of the deferred increments and arrears to primary teachers and special need assistants on 12 February 2015 and to post-primary teachers on 19 February 2015.</p><p>  The overall cost of the software for the deferral of increments is approximately &euro;64,000, including VAT.</p></reply>

The date on which annual increments fell due for civil servants were spread out over the course of the calendar year and were determined by the date of appointment and  normally paid on the anniversary of appointment provided performance during the year  was satisfactory. Currently, Departments are applying the provisions of the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA), which came into effect from 1st July, 2013, to the payment of increments. One of the measures agreed under the HRA was that staff increments - after payment of their first increment after the introduction of the HRA &ndash; were to be deferred for periods of between three months and six months depending on salary level as follows:</p><p>- Less than &euro;35,000 &ndash; one three month increment freeze - &euro;35,000 to &euro;65,000 &ndash; two three month increment freezes - Above &euro;65,000 to max of PO (higher) scale &ndash; two six month increment freeze - Salaries starting over &euro;100,000 &ndash; incremental progression suspended for three years.</p><p>  In addition, as a balancing measure, the HRA provided, for staff earning between &euro;35,000 and &euro;65,000* and on the maximum of their salary scale before or during 2013, that the following would apply: 1. A reduction of 2 days annual leave for next three years; or 2. 2 days unpaid leave for next three years (subject to management approval); or 3. Cash deduction from salary of equivalent amount; or 4. Cash deduction of half of the most recent increment, whichever is the lesser.</p><p>  If staff reach the maximum point after 2013, the above provisions will be implemented on a reducing basis.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that instructions in relation to the payment of increments to staff in this Department are now issued by PeoplePoint (The HR &amp;amp; Pensions Shared Service under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform), to Staff Salaries section of this Department. Prior to the instructions issuing, PeoplePoint liaise with the HR Unit of my Department particularly where they are proposing not to pay increments to staff members on the basis of an unsatisfactory/no performance ratings.  In cases where staff do not have a current PMDS (Performance Management Development System) rating recorded on the Human Resource Management System the line manager of the staff member is contacted to ensure that they return the staff members PMDS rating via the PeoplePoint portal as soon as possible. In such cases and if the increment is to be paid a delay may take place in terms of when the actual payment is made.</p><p>  *Officers who have 23 days annual leave or less are excluded from the provisions of this section of the Haddington Road Agreement</p></reply>

My Department operates the largest payroll in the State, with approximately 98,000 school employees and pensioners paid every fortnight.  These payrolls have become increasingly complex over the past five years, due to the following:</p><p>- Introduction of three salary scales and two sets of allowances, by comparison to a single salary scale and set of allowances for all teachers, prior to 2010.</p><p>- Introduction of the Universal Social Charge (USC), Pension related Deduction (PRD) and the single pension scheme.</p><p>- Implementation of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 and new sick leave regulations for schools employees etc.In addition, the school employee payrolls have a high volume of substitute and casual appointments for payment, which is not a feature of other comparable payrolls for Civil Servants, Army, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na etc. Work is ongoing at present to incorporate payments to home tutors through the payroll, which will broaden the range of payees coming within the remit of the school employee payrolls.</p><p>  Accordingly, the development of the software to implement the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) in the context of the overall numbers being paid on the payroll (including substitute and casual appointees), the payroll complexities referenced above and the complexity of the agreement itself has been a very difficult and complex task.  A further complication is the fact that the software programme in addition to dealing with the deferred increments has to calculate/re calculate the salary reduction provisions of the HRA for those reaching &euro;65,000 taking account of the impact of increments and allowances.</p><p>  The development of the programmes together with the comprehensive testing necessary to ensure the correct application of the terms of the agreement has taken longer than projected to implement. The majority of increments for teachers earning less than &euro;65,000 including allowances became payable from the 1st December as teachers are generally appointed from 1 September. For the majority of those earning in excess of &euro;65,000 increments will become payable from the 1st March.  The target dates for the payment of the deferred increments and arrears to primary teachers and special need assistants is the 12th February and to post primary teachers on 19 February. It will only be possible to provide data in relation to the numbers impacted by the deferral of increments at the beginning of February.  Arrangements will be made to have the new scales implemented for the 2011 appointees as soon as possible after the work in relation to the deferral of increments is completed.</p><p>  I understand that teachers who commenced teaching in the current academic school year are being paid on the correct incremental scale.</p></reply>

This is necessary to take cognisance of the ongoing changing demands as new projects, work functions and schemes are introduced and the work associated with existing projects, work functions and schemes decrease or cease. The introduction of automated processes also impacts on staffing requirements of the section.</p><p>  In that context the Haddington Road Agreement is only one of a significant number of projects and schemes that have been successfully project managed and introduced in recent years. These include Pension Related Deduction (PRD), Universal Social Charge (USC), Single European Payments Area (SEPA), Single Pension Scheme, implementation of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, additional payrolls for part-time teachers and the revised sick leave scheme arrangements. Similar staffing implementation arrangements are being applied for the Haddington Road agreement as applied for the other projects.</p><p>  The overall level of staffing in the section has increased by six full time equivalents in the period referred to by the Deputy.  Additional temporary staffing resources are also deployed when required to cover long term absences such as maternity leave.</p><p>  I am quite satisfied that the staffing level in my Department's payroll section is sufficient to ensure the issuing of salary payments on a fortnightly basis to serving teachers, special needs assistants, secretaries and caretakers employed under the 1978/79 schemes and retired teachers and non-teaching staff.</p></reply>

In future schools will no longer be required to keep the Cl&aacute;rleabhar therefore POD will be the official register of pupils in schools and data will be retained to allow pupils to obtain their records in the future. The Department's retention policy is for audit and accounting purposes as pupil's data is used in the allocation of teaching posts and funding to schools. The policy also serves to trace retention trends in the education system, is important for longitudinal research and policy formation, as well as being an important statistical indicator nationally and internationally. Aggregate and not individual data is used for the majority of these purposes.  This retention policy has been agreed with the Data Protection Commissioner and the Department is continually reviewing its retention policy for pupil data in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p>  The Department takes the protection of pupil's data very seriously.  Pupil data is stored securely in the Department's Oracle database. This database is hosted on the Department's servers which are located in the Revenue Commissioners data-centre in St Johns' Road.  Access to the servers is protected by both Revenue and Government firewalls. Staff of the Revenue Commissioners do not have access to the data in the database. POD application roles have been developed which limit school staff to viewing and maintaining their own pupil records. Access within the Department to POD data is limited to the POD team which is currently less than 15 people.  No agency or other Government Department will have direct access to the Primary Online Database.</p><p>  As Data Controllers, schools are obliged to inform the parents/guardians of their pupils that some of the data they collect with be passed to the Department, explain the purpose that the data is being collected for and outline how long it will be retained for and how it will be stored. Parental consent is also required to answer the questions relating to religion and ethnic or cultural background.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year by 26 March 2014. The NCSE published details of their allocations for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year in June 2014. The NCSE completed a second round allocations for SNA provision for the 2014/15 school year in October 2014, details of which are available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  Schools who wish to make an application for additional SNA support may make such an application to the NCSE.</p><p>  Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

SOLAS, under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills, is responsible for the strategic co-ordination and funding of the Further Education and Training sector. <br/><br/>  The total number of FTE staff currently employed by SOLAS is 211. <br/><br/>  SOLAS staff operates across three divisions: <br/><br/>1. Strategy &amp;amp; Knowledge (Strategy &amp;amp; Evaluation, Operational Planning &amp;amp; Stakeholder Engagement, Programme Improvement); 2. FET Services &amp;amp; Supports (Apprenticeship, Central Programmes, Strategy &amp;amp; Supports); 3. Resources (ICT, Finance, HR/Organisation Development).<br/><br/>  The skill set of staff employed within the divisions include FET Planning &amp;amp; Programme Development, Management, ICT, Finance, Research, HR, Communications, Administration and Clerical.  It should be noted that SOLAS provides support (mainly ICT) to both the Education &amp;amp; Training Boards and the Department of Social Protection.<br/><br/>The total salary cost associated with the FTE 211 employees is &euro;12.37m. <br/><br/>  Shortly after the establishment of SOLAS, it exited the former F&Aacute;S HQ and relocated its Head Office to smaller, more suitable premises in Dublin 1.  The basic rent of the new building equates to &euro;14.50 (plus vat) per square foot and is highly competitive for the area.  The total cost of the rent is &euro;1.4m per annum, including vat and will generate substantial savings based on the cost of the former F&Aacute;S HQ.  This figure includes the amortisation of the fit-out costs, which will be borne by the landlord, over a five year period.</p></reply>

A National Education and Training Boards Steering Committee, consisting of the 5 ETBs which do not have training centres and the 5 ETBs which provide training services on their behalf, has been established by the sector to facilitate the implementation of this next stage in the transition process.  The next meeting of the Steering Committee has been scheduled for 16 January 2015.  As part of this process, engagement is being facilitated between the ETBs concerned with a view to determining the resources which will transfer from the ETBs with training centres to the ETBs currently without training centres to enable the target date to be met.</p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.  </p><p>The maximum grant per beneficiary for equipment is as follows:</p><p>-  Monitored personal alarms (with pendant) - &euro;250</p><p>-  Additional pendant/Re-installation - &euro;50  </p><p>  The annual monitoring costs (generally between &euro;60 - &euro;80 per annum) are borne by the beneficiary.  </p><p>  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation's significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.  </p><p>  Pobal's management and administrative services for the Scheme includes an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014.  A panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas.  As the market for the equipment is well established, it was neither necessary nor prudent to engage in consultations on the matter.  The tender included a requirement for suppliers to set out their value added services, including the supply of smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms.  The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete.  </p><p>  This new approach will reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly.  It will enable the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to support and interact with the elderly in the local community.</p></reply>

This replaced a procedure which had allowed non-use of a vehicle to be declared after the fact, which was unverifiable and was estimated as leading to losses of some &euro;50 million annually.<br/><br/>In 2014, following the introduction of the new system, gross motor tax receipts, at &euro;1.159bn, increased by &euro;41m on 2013.  This occurred despite the fact that there have been no increases in motor tax since the new measures took effect and that reductions could otherwise have been expected given the ongoing changeover of the car fleet to the CO<sub>2</sub>based system, which carries a lower average tax.  It should be noted that arrears in 2014 amounted to some &euro;60m compared to &euro;22m - &euro;24m in the years prior to the introduction of the new system, suggesting that the new system has been effective in improving compliance.<br/><br/>Under the current provisions, motorists are now required to either tax their vehicle or declare it off the road in advance.  The operation of the motor tax system is kept under regular review and amending legislation is brought forward where it is deemed necessary to do so.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  <br/><br/>Following a review of the overarching water charges policy framework, the Government has made further decisions to ensure that water charges are affordable for customers.  On 19 November 2014, I announced a package of measures to ensure that a simpler, fairer, more certain and more affordable charging regime is in p lace for Irish Water customers.  Details of these measures are avail able on my Department's website at<i><font color="#0000FF">: </font></i>. <br/><br/>The Water Services Act 2014 which was enacted on 28 December 2014 has given effect to these measures.  <br/><br/>Currently, any farm connected to a public water supply is liable for charges as a non-domestic customer, with an allowance provided for domestic use.  From 1 January 2015, following the introduction of domestic water charges, farms connected to public water supplies will be charged by Irish Water for both non-domestic and domestic use.  Domestic charges will be subject to the maximum charges set for households and free allowances to be provided to children under 18.  There are no additional allowances available other than those announced.  <br/><br/>It should be noted that the existing arrangements for all non-domestic customers are remaining in place with no changes for the time being.  On this basis, the local authorities will continue to bill for non-domestic water services as agents of Irish Water.  The CER will be reviewing all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs under a series of public consultations and will publish the time-line for this process in the next few months.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. <br/><br/>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR charge. The Act provided for a period, from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014, during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities. If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014. In addition, the entire NPPR liability is increased by a factor of 50% and frozen.<br/><br/>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 , my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at , encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include sguidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases. <br/><br/>Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect NPPR charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstancesis a matter for the relevant local authority. The information requested is, therefore, not available inmy Department. </p></reply>

The 2004 Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review. Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent. These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement. <br/><br/>I am very conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents. In the third quarter of 2014, rents were 5.6% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2013 , according to the most recent rent index from the PRTB. Rents for houses were 4.3% higherin the third quarter of 2014, while apartment rents were 7.3% higher than in the same quarter of 2013. In Dublin, which is seeing the highest rates of increase nationally, overall rents were higher by 9.5%. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market and the recently published <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list. In addition, the implementation of the range of actions under the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020</i>Strategy will support increased supply in the wider housing market.<br/><br/>A recent poll for the PRTB found that only 64% of tenants were aware of their rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. The PRTB is developing a new communications strategy, which will include increasing awareness of existing rights and obligations under the legislation and will be rolled out early this year. <br/><br/>I have no function in relation to the operations of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) in the private rental market. Responsibility for NAMA rests with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

The Government decided that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. While Bord G&aacute;&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann (BGE) had suggested at an early meeting with my Department that water charges were not dependent on metering and other forms of charging could be considered, BGE were informed that the Government&rsquo;s policy involved the installation of meters to facilitate a fair and equitable system of charges and to promote the conservation of water resources. T he decision to install water meters was a decision taken by the Government, and not one taken in consultation with BGE, and it isrecorded in the papers prepared for Government on these matters. Therefore the question of publication of minutes of meetings with BGE on the decision on metering does not arise. <br/><br/>Following the Government decisions to establish Irish Water as a subsidiary of BGE and for Irish Water to implement the domestic metering programme, there were regular meetings between my Department and Irish Water and indeed other stakeholders. As part of this process there were also regular &ldquo;checkpoint meetings&rdquo; between the Department and BGE. In most cases, minutes or a note of a meeting would be recorded. However, if a meeting was simply a briefing on issues there may simply be a record of the meeting having taken place with progress on the various issues being pursued through separate working arrangements, for example through the development and exchange of documents and recording in programme management tracking records. In light of this, I do not believe there is any requirement for an investigation into a situation where minutes were not kept for a meeting. </p></reply>

The numbers of households on social housing waiting lists are subject to on-going fluctuation due to households being allocated housing and new households applying for housing support.  My Department does not hold day to day information on the number of applications made to each local authority, the numbers allocated housing support and the numbers on housing lists. <br/><br/>There are statutory Summaries of Social Housing Assessments carried out at regular intervals. The most recent summaries were carried out in March 2011 and May 2013. In 2011, there were 3,255 households on the Meath local authority waiting list and this had reduced to 2,502 in 2013. The full results of the 2011 and 2013 summary of assessments are available on my Departments&rsquo; website at the links below. The 2013 results are not directly comparable to previous results as the 2013 summary employed different methodologies and was the first to be carried out under the 2011 Social Housing Assessment Regulations.<br/><br/>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>includes a commitment to increase the regularity of the Housing Needs Assessment by undertaking it on annual basis, from 2016 onwards.<br/><br/>2011:.<br/><br/>2013:.</p></reply>

It is not specified that this only relates to customers who have registered with the company. <br/><br/>Section 32 of the Act provides that Irish Water must submit a code or codes of practice to the CER for approval and the CER may modify any such code. A code of practice made under section 32 can include, <i>inter alia</i>, a provision for customer complaints to Irish Water in relation to provision of water services, the standards for the performance by Irish Water of its functions and any other matter the CER considers necessary and appropriate to secure the interests of customers of Irish Water. In discharging its functions, the CER may consult with Irish Water, the public, or any other person it considers appropriate. Irish Water also has a statutory obligation to comply with any direction from the CER in relation to the approved codes. Irish Water&rsquo;s approved codes of practice can be found on its website, at:<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Similar to the approach it has taken in the electricity and gas industries, the CER has required Irish Water to submit a Customer Handbook outlining the minimum requirements of customer service standards they will provide to their customers. The Customer Handbook comprises Irish Water&rsquo;s Customer Charter, Codes of Practice and the Terms and Conditions of supply. Following a public <br/><br/>consultation on the document in 2014, the CER have recently published the approved Irish Water Customer Handbook on their website, at<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a customer support call centre which is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This call centre is the initial point of contact for members of the public in contacting Irish Water. It is designed for reporting of any faults in water services and assisting customers with any queries and complaints related to water services. Members of the public who are not customers of Irish Water, but who may have an issue in relation to public water infrastructure,are also able to use this service for relevant matters .<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Water Services Act 2014 , which was enacted on 28 December 2014, includes a provision that the CER will provide a dispute resolution service for registered customers of Irish Water. This will be similar to the service operated by the Commission for the gas and electricity markets.<br/><br/>Under the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for repair and maintenance of the internal water distribution system from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner. However, the Government has agreed to provide additional funding to Irish Water for their capital investment to include a free first fix scheme. Irish Water has submitted a draft first fix policy to the Commission for Energy Regulation for approval. The CER intend to hold a public consultation in relation to this scheme in Quarter 1 2015.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives and has contacted all Oireachtas members to provide details of an improved level of service which it is aiming to provide. The team can be contacted via email to or by telephone on a new dedicated number, 1890 578 578.  </p></reply>

The overall social housing funding provision for 2015 has been increased by in excess of &euro;200 million, with capital funding increasing by &euro;180 million, which will allow for significant expansion in social housing provision. The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform</i>builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.  <br/><br/>The Strategy provides for a total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and aims to meet the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, consequently addressing the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand. <br/><br/>In committing to provide 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, the Strategy marks a fresh start for social housing in Ireland. Action 1 of the Strategy requires the agreement of targets for delivery of social housing for 2015 and subsequent years. These specific targets will be agreed through the Strategy&rsquo;s governance structure, which is currently being put in place, in collaboration with local authorities and with input from the approved housing body sector.  I expect that, nationally, some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided under a range of initiatives for 2015.  <br/><br/>Local authorities are responsible for the detailed planning of social housing provision based on the needs of their areas. Accordingly, it is a matter for Meath County Council to set its target and plan for its delivery through, for example, local authority/approved housing body social housing developments, built, acquired, leased, etc.  My Department is working with Meath County Council and all other local authorities within the context of the increased funding now available to support them and provide appropriate funding to address their housing need locally and to meet the Social Housing Strategy targets for 2015 and beyond.<br/><br/>As regards the issue of Homelessness, on 20 May 2014, the <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>was published in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.  A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at:<br/><br/><i></i><br/><br/>In addition, on 4 December 2014, my Department hosted a special Summit on Homelessness to reaffirm the Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness.  The Summit was attended by Oireachtas members, elected members and officials from the four Dublin Local Authorities, representatives from Government Departments, State Agencies and the NGO sector, and the Catholic and Church of Ireland Archbishops of Dublin.<br/><br/>A number of actions arising from the Summit were considered at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 8 December and were then formalised into an <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>which was noted by the Government at its meeting on 9 December 2014.  A copy of this Plan is also available on my Department's website at the link provided above. </p></reply>

The elected members of each local authority will then have a number of months to make the first rent scheme under the 2009 Act and I expect that theywill comply with the law in this matter. <br/><br/>Section 31 rents are expected to be introduced on 1 July 2015 with housing authorities having a 2-year transition period during which they will continue to set rents at their discretion for their own housing stock and for leased properties, including dwellings provided under the Rental Accommodation Scheme. The introduction of the rent framework will mean that, on the expiry of the 2 year transitional period, the amount of rent payable by some households may be lower in some cases, and higher in others, than the rent currently payable under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The transition period will give housing authorities the opportunity to move in incremental steps towards the rent levels that will apply on expiry of the transition period.<br/><br/>The details of the new rent framework are being finalised in the context of the drafting of the forthcoming Regulations.</p></reply>

The scheme will operate along the lines of the incremental purchase model currently operating for local authority apartments and certain new local authority houses, which involve discounts for purchasers linked to household income and a discount-related charge on the property that reduces to nil over a period, unless the house is resold or the purchaser fails to comply with conditions of the sale. Where the tenant purchaser resells the property before the end of the charge period, he or she will be required to pay back to the housing authority a portion of any profits arising from the sale, thereby compensating the State for its loss on the original sale of the property and generating funds for the local authority to invest in new social housing or the refurbishment of existing housing.<br/><br/>Full details of the new scheme will be set out in regulations that I will make as part of the introduction of the scheme. </p></reply>

LCDP is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281 million over that period. It is being implemented on a transitional basis until March next, pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April next.</p><p>  As part of the programme of reform of local government, Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) were established in all local authorities. These Committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis. They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.</p><p>  The new SICAP is one of my key priorities and targets a range of groups across communities. In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently under way. </p><p>  Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed. Stage two (Invitation to Tender), got under way on 20th October 2014 and involved the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process. The closing date for receipt of tenders under stage two was noon on 19 December 2014. The tenders received are currently being evaluated and tenderers will be informed of the outcome by mid February. </p><p>  It should be noted that the procurement process for SICAP was open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme. In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications.</p><p>  All groups who received LCDP funding in 2014 are being funded through LCDP interim arrangements until 31 March next, pending the outcome of the SICAP competitive process.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October. Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households. Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.</p><p>  There are now 535 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme. </p><p>  During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee, that would include a full review of the statutory pilot phase. Data for this report are being gathered from pilot sites and the report will be submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht shortly, in advance of full roll out of the scheme, which is scheduled to begin on a phased basis later this year. Following the completion of the review, consideration will be given to the sequence of local authorities to commence HAP during the full roll out phase.</p></reply>

The Strategy provides for a total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and aims to meet the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, consequently addressing the needs of the 90,000 households currently on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.   Implementing the Strategy will require a considerable and co-ordinated effort from key stakeholders including the Local Authorities. A governance structure has been established including a Local Authority work stream to ensure the actions in the Strategy are overseen and delivered. In order to ensure delivery, I am chairing the Oversight Group which will meet later this month.</p><p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. In this regard, it is a matter for Chief Executives, in the first instance, to ensure that the appropriate service levels are maintained. Local Authorities are currently in the process of assessing their technical and administrative resource requirements to deliver both the Housing Capital Programmes and also the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p><p>  As announced in the recent Budget, it is proposed that with effect from 2015, the moratorium and the Employment Control Framework for the Public Service will be lifted but recruitment / promotion will be subject to adherence to binding 3 year pay ceilings. Staffing resources must be managed within these overall ceilings. Detailed arrangements in terms of the local authority sector will be worked out between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  My Department examines all staffing sanction requests on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. In considering sanction requests public safety, maintaining key front line services, and economic issues are given precedence. My Department has recently met with some of the largest urban local authorities to agree resource requirements, and has received a number of staffing requests to facilitate the delivery of the Government's housing plans. Details in relation to requests are being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The NORA levy was increased from 1 cent to 2 cent per litre on 1 October 2009. In respect of the period 2008-2014, as per the Financial Statements, the NORA levy income was as follows: 2008 - &euro;81.4m, 2009 - &euro;93.3m, 2010 - &euro;137.7m, 2011- &euro;126.7m, 2012 - &euro;120.2m, 2013 - &euro;120.4m, 2014 (estimated) - &euro;118.4m. <br/><br/>The Agency is responsible for ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under EU legislation (Directive 2009/119/EC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) Treaty to maintain a minimum of 90 days stocks of strategic emergency oil stocks for use in the event of an oil supply disruption. This is the main purpose of the NORA levy. As of 31 December 2014, NORA&rsquo;s oil stocks amounted to 1.5 million tonnes, covering its obligations of 90 days oil stocks. Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil stocks are held either in Ireland or in another EU Member State with whom Ireland has a bilateral stockholding agreement. Up to 2008, a large portion of stocks were held abroad and a large proportion of stocks were held as stock tickets (contracts to deliver oil in an emergency) rather than as physical oil stocks. At end 2008, 42% of Ireland&rsquo;s obligation was covered by stock tickets and 53% of stocks were held abroad.<br/><br/>In order to improve resilience and oil security in response to a potential oil supply disruption, the Government set an objective in 2007 that the strategic oil stocks should be rebalanced to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s wholly owned stocks of oil and the level of stocks on the island subject to increased storage availability and value for money considerations. This is in line with the EU Directive which obliges Member States to ensure stocks are physically available and accessible in an emergency. <br/><br/>Significant progress has been made in recent years by NORA in procuring additional storage specifically in Ireland, building physical stocks (rather than relying on stock tickets), rebalancing stocks in light of changing consumption trends and upgrading stocks in line with EU fuel specifications. NORA has been maximising its storage on the island of Ireland and has refurbished tanks in Dublin, Kerry and Antrim increasing by 350,000 tonnes the amount of strategic oil storage on the island. NORA has also been rebalancing the composition of stocks stored to reflect national consumption trends of petrol, diesel, gasoil, kerosene (heating), aviation fuel and fuel oil. NORA also has to fund the ongoing storage costs of holding these significant volumes of oil. <br/><br/>Of the stocks held by NORA at the end of 2014, approximately 68% were held as stocks on the island of Ireland, 30% as stocks abroad and 2% in Stock Tickets. In managing Ireland&rsquo;s obligations, NORA is subject to euro dollar exchange rate changes, fluctuations in oil prices and variances in funding costs and interest rates. NORA has succeeded in reducing the Agency&rsquo;s debt from &euro;444m at the end of 2008 to &euro;111m at the end of 2014. NORA&rsquo;s work in the period 2008-2014 has substantially improved Ireland&rsquo;s oil resilience and security of supply improving the availability and accessibility of oil stocks in an emergency.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On the 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched. The map can be accessed at . The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016. The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State. <br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises / home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands in every county in Ireland, including Counties Longford and Westmeath. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015. This is a requirement under EU state aid rules.<br/><br/>A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder or bidders towards the end of this year and in this regard the Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost to taxpayers as low as possible. It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p><p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite. The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs. This is designed to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers. The policy framework allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p><p>  As regards the connection of Longford to the gas network, and having full regard to CER&rsquo;s network connections policy, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive assessment of 39 towns not already connected to the national gas network, with detailed economic analysis based on criteria outlined in the policy. The study was published in April 2010 following approval by the CER. The study included an appraisal of Longford as one of a group of towns. The Gaslink report found that 35 towns, including Longford, when appraised on an individual basis or as a group, did not qualify for connection on economic grounds.</p><p>  Gaslink continues to keep under review the towns which did not qualify for connection under that study, and other towns, on an ongoing basis. The key factor which would qualify a town, or group of towns, in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility. To date, this has not happened in the case of Longford.</p></reply>

An open and competitive procurement process was conducted in accordance with Department of Finance and EU procurement frameworks. A pre-qualification questionnaire was issued on on 17 January 2011. This invited interested parties to tender for the contract as a postcode management licence holder for a period of 10 years to design, provide, disseminate and maintain a National Postcode System. A number of companies entered and participated in the procurement process. Three parties qualified following Stage 1 of the procurement process. Landmark, a UK company, withdrew from the process at the final tender stage. The Department subsequently received two final bids from consortia led by Capita and An Post.<br/><br/>On 8 October 2013, the Government approved the appointment of Capita Business Support Services Ireland Limited as the company which will develop, roll-out and operate the National Postcode System.<br/><br/>I have received the submission referenced by the Question and make the following general points. There has been widespread support from both public sector bodies and private businesses with particular interest from the retail and financial industries for the introduction of postcodes nationally. In addition, the emergency services see the introduction of postcodes as facilitating the speedier deployment of their services. An Post, who were actively involved in the design process, and who are fully committed to using Eircodes, are currently updating their mail sortation systems to fully integrate with Eircodes. Eircodes will facilitate improved efficiencies and quality improvements in the mails sector and provide a stimulus to mail volumes through improved marketing capabilities. The consortium developing the system has also undertaken a significant programme of business engagement with both private and public stakeholders. The unique identifier will be particularly useful in identifying the 35% of addresses in Ireland which are non-unique.<br/><br/>The Government is fully committed to introducing Eircodes. The project is currently in the implementation phase and is scheduled to be rolled out nationwide by the middle of 2015. Every Irish address will be receiving a unique Eircode by post. In common with postcodes systems internationally, our postcode system is designed to identify addresses as opposed to other physical features and locations.<br/><br/>My Department will respond directly to the correspondent in relation to the submission with reference to the detailed points contained therein.</p></reply>

At end of 2014 there was approximately 2,500 MW of renewable generation capacity connected to the national grid.<br/><br/>One of the eligibility criteria for support under the REFIT schemes is that full planning permission has been issued by the appropriate planning authority for the construction of the relevant electricity generating plant at the site, or that the applicant demonstrates that planning permission is not required.<br/><br/>All parties applying to connect to the national grid apply to the relevant System Operator, either the Transmission System Operator (TSO), EirGrid, or the Distribution System Operator (DSO), ESB Networks. The relevant System Operator will then issue a Connection Offer to eligible parties, termed 'Live offer'. Should a party wish to connect to the grid, it then executes this offer to form a Connection Agreement upon which the project is termed 'contracted'. In addition to planning permission, projects supported under REFIT must have an executed grid Connection Agreement. Once the Connection Agreement is executed, the necessary connection works are undertaken to connect the project to the grid. Once these are completed, the project is termed 'connected/energised'. <br/><br/>The System Operators have provided the data in the table below which give the current status of projects granted permission to connect to the grid in the period since 2000:<table><tr><th>Status</th><th>TSO (MW)</th><th>DSO (MW)</th><th>TSO+DSO (MW)</th></tr><tr><td>Connected/Energised</td><td>991</td><td>1325</td><td>2316</td></tr><tr><td>Contracted</td><td>1745.2</td><td>2178</td><td>3923.2</td></tr><tr><td>Live offer</td><td>194</td><td>227</td><td>421</td></tr><tr><td>Total (MW)</td><td>2930.2</td><td>3730</td><td>6660.2</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The quantity in megawatts of renewable energy generating capacity that has received final planning permission by local authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not held by my Department. </p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On the 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched. The map can be accessed at . The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016. The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State and includes Ballyclough, Co Limerick.<br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises / home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands in every county in Ireland, including Co Limerick. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015. This is a requirement under EU state aid rules.<br/><br/>A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder or bidders towards the end of this year and in this regard the Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost to taxpayers as low as possible. It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

There may also be potential savings in the areas of accommodation and software licences.

The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, are a matter in the first instance, for the many commercial players who operate in the Irish market. Therefore, decisions on when and where to locate investment are always taken on commercial grounds, having regard to the likely return on investment. Under EU Commission's State Aid guidelines, the State is prohibited from providing any financial assistance to any commercial operator for the expansion of their broadband service.</p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) is a commitment to ensure that every citizen and business in Ireland has access to high quality, high speed broadband. This will be delivered through a combination of commercial and state investment.</p><p>  The recent engagement between my Departmental officials and the telecommunications industry has highlighted the large number of small-scale local wireless operators who are currently providing broadband services to many local communities nationwide. This engagement has also highlighted the issues small operators have today to meet local demand for high speed broadband and the high cost associated with upgrading their services.</p><p>  If any of these companies can demonstrate beyond doubt that they have the capability and resources to provide high speed broadband through their own investment then we will include them on our coverage map and the State led intervention will not be rolled out in these areas.</p><p>  Even if these operators cannot afford to invest in their networks, I still see a major role for these companies as we will be providing the necessary funding to ensure a wholesale network is available that will be fully open to any retail operator who wishes to offer high speed broadband services to business or residential customers. Given the established customer base of many of these local companies I am confident that the NBP intervention will enable them to offer significantly enhanced services to their customers. My Department will be launching a procurement process later this year to award a contract or contracts for the roll out of the high speed network and all companies, large and small, may have an opportunity to be part of this process and receive funding for the network build.</p><p>  Charges for connection to the Distribution System are calculated by ESB Networks Ltd and approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). This matter is an operational matter for the company concerned and not one in which I, as Minister, have a role or function.</p></reply>

There is no price control in the oil sector and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. Responsibility for gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation. As such, I have no statutory function in the setting of gas, oil, petrol or diesel prices.The competitive energy market results in choices for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices and exerts downward pressure on prices. Consumers can try to mitigate electricity prices by shopping around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers. Measures such as comparison websites, approved by the CER, exist to assist them in this endeavour.<br/><br/>The CER is focussed on actions that can mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.<br/><br/>The latest EUROSTAT figures, published by the SEAI on the 9<sup></sup>December 2014 show all business consumption bands in both electricity and gas experienced reductions in average prices in the first half of 2014, ranging from 0.7% to 4% in electricity and 6.7% to 12.9% in gas. <br/><br/>Similarly, EUROSTAT figures show a reduction of 5.7% in the average price of gas in the residential consumption band with the largest share of the market, while the average price of electricity in the residential consumption band with the largest share experienced a reduction of 1.3%.<br/><br/>Households can also reduce their energy costs by being energy efficient. There are energy efficiency measures to assist business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them.<br/><br/>There is a role for the Consumer and Competition Commission in ensuring that markets are functioning well and that consumers are not being disadvantaged. Previous investigations and surveys into oil prices, including home heating oil, have been undertaken by the National Consumer Agency (now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission), and these are available at . Home heating oil surveys have been carried out by the National Consumer Agency on a regular basis. The latest heating oil survey indicated variations in price and the Agency encouraged consumers to shop around and get a number of quotes. The research indicates that the price paid by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.<br/><br/>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices and net prices (excluding duties and taxes) of petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis. The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is:<br/><br/>.</p></reply>

This is a legal obligation in Ireland and throughout the EU. There have never been exemptions from this obligation and the requirement is not determined by the period that the vehicle is or has been in use or mileage.     </p><p>  Roadworthiness testing standards are aimed at detecting any wear and tear, deterioration or alterations that could affect the roadworthiness or safety of the vehicle. There are no exceptions for vehicles which are temporarily off the road which can degrade and deteriorate during the period while they are off the road.</p><p>  Since October 2013, the certificate of roadworthiness (CRW) issuing system is aligned to the longstanding obligation to have commercial vehicles tested annually.  The period of validity of the CRW is calculated by reference to the last test due date.  A delay on the part of a vehicle owner in completing the test has the effect of reducing the validity period of the CRW.   This change was introduced for the purpose of ensuring that operators who do not test their vehicles by the due date do not gain any economic advantage over operators who have their vehicles tested in accordance with the legal requirements.</p><p>  I expect a review of the system as it applies to vehicles which are off the road for more than a year to be completed this year.   Any amendments to the system in respect of vehicles overdue the test by more than one year, and which have been off the road, would need to be considered against a background of very strong overall compliance, as well as road safety considerations.</p><p>  Compliance with the obligation for annual testing is fundamental to improving the roadworthiness standard of commercial vehicles on our roads.  Apart from safer roads for all road users, the reforms being made to the commercial vehicle testing system are designed to level the competitive playing field for commercial vehicle operators by reducing non-compliance with testing and roadworthiness requirements.</p></reply>

Prior to the recent change, this offence involved a direct summons to court and the assignment of 5 penalty points on conviction. The provisions in the 2014 Act brought this offence within the fixed charge notice system. An alleged offender will now be issued with a fixed charge notice and, on payment of the &euro;60 charge, will have 3 penalty points assigned to their licence. The driver will, of course, continue to have the option of going to court where 5 points will still apply on conviction.</p><p>  I understand from the Road Safety Authority (RSA) that any car owner should receive an NCT appointment within 28 days and that in order to meet this standard, in some cases, the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) holds requests on a waiting list until a suitable slot is found. In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale.</p><p>  The RSA is encouraging people to book early, as the test may be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the due test date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate. This system is to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires.</p><p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. If a person's NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Garda&iacute; to use their discretion. However, responsibility rests with owners and users of vehicles to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.</p><p>  As the RSA has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight and delivery of the National Car Test, statistics relating to NCT waiting times at test centres are a matter for the Authority. I have therefore referred Deputy Murphy's Question, together with that part of Deputy Mulherin's Question relating to current NCT waiting times at each test centre in the country, to the RSA for direct reply.  Please advise my Office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

Other vehicles towing trailers are not recorded in the data.Over the period 1996 to 2012, there has been a decline in the number of fatal, serious and minor injury collisions involving at least one of these vehicle types in line with the overall decline in collisions during this period. There were 248 incidents in 1996, and this reduced to 48 in 2012.

Most of the allocation (&euro;750,000) was to further extend the 2011 facilities initiative. A smaller portion of the allocation (&euro;150,000) was to enable the IABA to purchase equipment for boxing clubs, while &euro;75,000 was provided for works at the National Stadium.  While all of the grants in this scheme have been allocated, the IABA will still accept applications to place on a waiting list in the event that any existing clubs in the scheme fail to take up their grant. <br/><br/>The Sports Capital Programme is the Government&rsquo;s primary vehicle for supporting the development of sports facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment.  Any organisation interested in applying for a grant under the next round of the Sports Capital Programme should register on OSCAR at (if not already registered). OSCAR is the portal on the Department's website which must be used by organisations to register, to apply for funding (when the Programme is open for applications) and to manage the drawdown of any grants allocated. It should be noted that in order to register on OSCAR a tax registration number from the Revenue Commissioners is required. I hope to announce a further round of the Sports Capital Programme in the near future.<br/><br/>It may be possible for clubs to raise funds via the &lsquo;Tax Relief for Donations to Certain Sports Bodies&rsquo; scheme (section 847A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997). This is a Revenue operated scheme which offers tax benefits to individuals or companies who make donations to sports clubs.  Further details on this scheme and how it operates can be found on the Revenue Commissioners website.</p></reply>

I understand Minister Varadkar was concerned that to proceed any further with the scheme to build the M20 would have exposed the NRA to significant costs arising from a consequent requirement to purchase the CPO'd land within a limited timeframe.  This would have had to be done without the reasonable prospect of proceeding to the construction stage quickly. Given the scale of the project I would have to consider very carefully whether the basis exists that would give confidence that a project of the scale of the M20 would be affordable or achievable and thereby justify commencing the project through planning again.</p></reply>

The local contribution for these schemes remains at 20% of the total cost of the project.  Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the LIS with their own resources. This position is likely to extend into this year.<br/><br/>Some local authorities want a ring-fenced LIS allocation for private roads while others prefer to put the funding into public roads. I think this decision is best made at a local level.</p></reply>

The Takeover Panel Rules in relation to communications apply to all parties during an offer period, including the Government as a shareholder, and all parties must apply the highest standards of care to any statements made on the matter.   The State has a significant but, nonetheless, a minority shareholding in Aer Lingus &ndash; we own just over 25% of the shares. In 2012, the Government included this shareholding among the assets to be sold under the State Asset Disposal programme, but agreed that the stake would only be sold when market conditions were favourable and if acceptable terms and an acceptable price could be secured. </p><p>  Currently, no formal offer has been made to Aer Lingus' shareholders. If an offer is made it will of course be given very careful examination before the Government takes any decision in relation to its shareholding. In late 2012, following a third hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus, the Government indicated that we would not be prepared to sell the shareholding in circumstances which could significantly impact on competition and connectivity in the Irish market. Such considerations would also be foremost in our minds if a further offer is made for the company.</p></reply>

All Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus routes have been included in the new five year direct award contracts between the companies and the NTA for the period to end of November 2019.  The NTA announced that 10% of publicly subvented bus services will only remain within the direct award contract until the end of 2016 after which they will be operated under separate contracts that will have been competitively tendered.</p><p>  At their request, I met with SIPTU, NBRU and TSSA bus unions on 15 December, 2014 during which the opening up of 10% of the bus market to competitive tender was discussed.   </p><p>  At that meeting I reiterated my commitment to supporting a well-funded public transport system into the future, recognising the vital role it plays in our economy and society generally. I pointed to my pledge to avoid further reductions in the Public Service Obligation (PSO) funding and ensured that in Budget 2015 PSO funding for bus and rail services was maintained at current levels.  This is the first time this has happened since 2008.  I also recently secured &euro;110 million for public transport as part of the Supplementary Estimate for my Department.   </p><p>  However, I believe that this level of support should be given in conjunction with an appropriate degree of competitive tension within the market, in the interests of quality and cost effective bus services for users.  This is why I am committed to the tendering of 10% of bus routes.  Furthermore, I believe that the engagements with trade unions being facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) are the appropriate forum for the further discussion of specific issues relating to the implementation of this policy.</p></reply>

There are prescribed procedures and limitations in place governing any reductions in pension rights introduced to address funding difficulties in a scheme such as the IASS.  Pensioners enjoy better protections under the rules than other categories of pension scheme member, such as active members or deferred pensioners.  Policy in this regard is primarily a matter for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>  Section 50 of the Pensions Act was amended in 2013 by the Oireachtas to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme facing funding difficulties.  These changes essentially spread the risk of scheme underfunding more evenly across all categories of scheme member, including pensioners.  It is a matter for the trustees of the scheme, who are required under trust law to act in the best interest of all scheme members, to determine how the relevant provisions in the Pensions Acts might be applied.</p><p>  The IASS Trustee has confirmed that the proposals that are now being implemented are in the overall best interests of the members of the IASS as a whole.  As you know, this was also the view of the Expert Panel.</p><p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties these necessary changes cause for many scheme members, including pensioners, but the risks that would have arisen for all members, the companies involved and the wider economy if this solution had not been implemented were even greater.</p></reply>

The nature of the surfacing provided on individual greenways would depend on the route to be traversed and it would not be unusual for portions of a single greenway to have different surfaces.</p><p>  There is no one size fits all for greenways, each greenway will be assessed on its individual merits.</p><p>  The permissive access model is a worthy mechanism for certain cycling and walking projects, particularly on a local level. It is a low cost community based model that provides access to the natural environment without interfering with the property rights of the landowners concerned. </p><p>  In terms of the best land access models for greenway delivery, the use of publicly owned land is advantageous from the perspective of reducing costs.  Negotiated permissive access, from the perspective of cost and public ownership, continues to have value but, for projects of national scale, consideration must be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.  The process of obtaining permissive access is resource intensive especially where agreement would need to be secured with hundreds or more landowners.  Greater investment is now being provided for greenways and it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.  Of course, as already stated, it will be a matter for all developers of cycling infrastructure to consider access to land on a case by case basis and to take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process.  The key consideration should always be to select an approach that will maximise the future use of the amenity concerned.  There are no plans within my Department to make future funding awards for greenways conditional on an authority having permanent access to those sections of the lands through which a greenway traverses.</p><p>  In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land, such as the Dublin &ndash; Galway greenway I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial agreements or, if required, CPO.  However,  I certainly recommend that all other options are considered before land purchase is decided upon.</p></reply>

When it comes to road safety, certain road users are especially vulnerable, including pedestrians and cyclists.  Both my Department and the Road Safety Authority have pursued and are continuing to pursue a wide range of measures to improve safety for all road users, and in particular for those who are most vulnerable.  These include infrastructural improvements through funding for the provision of cycle lanes and educational initiatives to improve awareness of the safety of cyclists, among both cyclists and motorists.</p><p>  However, I do not believe that a change in the law to allow some cyclists to use footpaths is an appropriate response.  This would take some cyclists off the road, but at the price of creating more risk for pedestrians.  It would also be difficult to enforce a situation in which some cyclists were allowed on footpaths and others not.  I have therefore no plans to amend the legislation on usage of footpaths at this time.</p></reply>

Major rail projects, such as Luas Cross City, will help supplement the range of viable low carbon alternatives to the car.</p><p>  The potential of rail freight in emissions reduction is also a consideration.  Total rail freight tonnage transported on the rail network in 2013 was 589,000, an increase of 4% on 2012, and 90.8 million tonne kilometres.  Irish Rail is actively pursuing rail freight expansion opportunities and engaging with ports, exporters and industry to identify viable commercial rail freight solutions.</p><p>  In recent years, good progress has also been made in the area of energy efficiency with correlated reductions in emissions.  Such achievement has arisen from various measures introduced across the rail network including the roll-out of traction control software on the DART and configuration changes from locomotive-hauled trains with one large diesel engine to Diesel Multiple Units.</p><p>  However, further potential for emissions reduction in the rail sector will have to be considered as part of a long-term strategy for land transport in Ireland.  The levels of investment currently being provided will help to keep the existing rail network open and accessible.  However, over the long term, the cost of operating the network will have to be benchmarked against investment in other transport modes.  The emissions reduction potential will be considered in this context and I hope to commence a consultation process this year on railway policy. </p></reply>

In that context, my aim is to continue to encourage and support nature conservation to the greatest degree possible.<br/><br/>In accordance with the relevant legislation, certain activities in sites designated for nature conservation may only be undertaken with my consent, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Compensation may be payable where a person has been refused consent by me for a prescribed activity within a designated site that he or she had been undertaking in the five year period prior to the refusal.<br/><br/>However, compensation or incentive schemes have generally been put in place, where required, without the need to undergo a formal process under the relevant legislation. Such schemes include:<br/><br/>- A comprehensive compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog habitat;<br/><br/>- A voluntary bog purchase scheme; and<br/><br/>- A farm plan scheme to support farmers in adopting appropriate management practices in the Natura 2000 network. <br/><br/>The voluntary bog purchase scheme and the farm plan scheme are closed to new applicants.<br/><br/>It is essential, in my view, that, wherever possible, use is made of opportunities for co-funding from the EU. Therefore, while my Department has the lead role in relation to the implementation of the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, significant funding is provided through the rural development programme, operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This programme provides for a range of supports for farmers, including payments in respect of sites nominated for designation or designated in accordance with the Directives.</p></reply>

Annex I species are those that are deemed in greatest need of conservation due to population and range declines.  In total six sites were designated in 2007 for the Hen Harrier:<br/><br/>1. Slieve Bloom Mountains SPA, Counties Laois &amp;amp; Offaly <br/><br/>2. Stack's to Mullaghareirk Mountains, West Limerick Hills and Mount Eagle SPA, Counties Cork, Kerry &amp;amp; Limerick <br/><br/>3. Mullaghanish to Musheramore Mountains SPA, Co. Cork <br/><br/>4. Slievefelim to Silvermines Mountains SPA, Counties Limerick &amp;amp; Tipperary <br/><br/>5. Slieve Beagh SPA, Co. Monaghan<br/><br/>6. Slieve Aughty Mountains SPA, Counties Clare &amp;amp; Galway<br/><br/>These SPAs include conifer plantations, heath/bog and rough grassland. Intensively managed agricultural land, houses and farm buildings have generally been excluded. Together the six sites total some 169,000 ha of land. Conifer plantation makes up 80,950 ha (48%), rough grassland 39,630 ha (23%) and heath/bog 47,760 ha (28%).<br/><br/>A habitat enhancement scheme (known as the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme) was available to farmers in Hen Harrier SPAs to undertake proactive measures for the species. These measures were not a condition of the designation, nor were they mandatory. My Department issued notifications to some 5,508 persons who were identified as having an interest in these sites. Voluntary commitments were entered into by 377 landowners under the Farm Plan Scheme covering over 9,000 hectares. 105 of the farm plans are still active.<br/><br/>Since the scheme commenced in 2008 until the end of December 2014, &euro;13,950,658 has been paid to the farmers in question. This scheme was sourced solely from Exchequer funding. Due to budgetary constraints, the scheme closed to new applicants in April 2010. My Department is honouring contracted commitments to the end of the 5 year period.<br/><br/>In terms of the future, my Department is in ongoing discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine concerning a range of measures for the protection or restoration of biodiversity, including the Hen Harrier, under Ireland's next EU co-funded Rural Development Programme.</p></reply>

In this regard, my Department conducted a critical examination of the structure and operation of the institutions included in the Public Service Reform Plan and developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area.</p><p>  Savings were made primarily in three ways:</p><p>  - Through the ending of payments to Chairpersons and members of boards or advisory councils;</p><p>  - Through a programme of shared services between institutions, including, for example, in retail, security, marketing, procurement and storage; and </p><p>  - Through the provision of services by my Department to some institutions, including human resources services and financial services, thus relieving those institutions of the need to incur a cost in accessing these services. </p><p>  The functions of Culture Ireland were merged fully into my Department during 2013 and the Board was replaced with an Expert Committee whose members provide their time on a pro bono basis.  In addition, the term of office of the Placenames Commission expired in October 2012 and was replaced by an Expert Committee which also operates on a pro bono basis. </p><p>  Furthermore, a formal Framework for Co-operation and Improved Services between the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery was developed and endorsed by Government.  Arising from that, the three Galleries signed a formal Service Level Agreement outlining a number of specific measures to share a number of services across the three Institutions.  Legislation has been prepared to give effect to these changes and to reduce the number on boards, provide for pro bono service and gender equality on each board.</p><p>  In December 2013, a new Human Resources Shared Services Unit was established in my Department to provide HR support to the National Museum of Ireland. Work is continuing between the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives of Ireland to improve co-operation between these institutions and to progress shared services. Legislation to formally enact these changes and changes to board structure is being progressed.</p><p>  I am satisfied that this programme of change has made a significant contribution to achieving the overall &euro;20m savings target set out in the Public Service Reform Plan, while at the same time enhancing the operations of the bodies concerned.</p></reply>
