It is employment-intensive, and covers every community in the country.  The combined wholesale and retail sector employs almost 273,000 people in Ireland &ndash; that is almost 15% of our total workforce.  </p><p>  In recognising the importance of the sector to the economy, the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs signalled out the sector as one with employment potential and contained a number of measures aimed at supporting the retail sector specifically. </p><p>  We have also introduced a number of initiatives of particular assistance including:</p><p>  - Reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% on a range of labour-intensive services, with a particular focus on the hospitality sector.</p><p>  - Introduction of the Credit guarantee scheme</p><p>  - Reform of wage setting mechanisms</p><p>  We are also working to reduce the level of compliance on small businesses, and as part of the Action Plan for Jobs developed the business regulation website and aim to deliver a 25% reduction in administrative burdens imposed on business and enable online compliance with regulations where possible. In addition, initiatives by the Companies Registration Office regarding online filing and the forthcoming Companies Bill will ensure a more efficient operating environment for enterprise.  During 2012, an audit of 159 licences for key sectors was conducted which identified potential to reduce considerably the burden of compliance with licenses.  I will seek to prioritise actions in this area for the retail sector in the coming year. </p><p>  I frequently meet with representatives of the retail sector and hear the challenges they face, including in relation to the costs of doing business.  My officials have also held separate discussions with retail representatives.  These engagements have assisted us in implementing the commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs and in identifying any further actions that can be taken to support the retail sector. </p><p>  I am currently finalising the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and I can confirm that it will include further actions aimed at supporting the retail sector.  My Department will continue its on-going engagement with representatives of the retail sector.  These engagements have proven very useful in their current format and I do not envisage setting up a separate retail strategy group at the present time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-24a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012400047#WRA00800"><p>The Government&rsquo;s position on the issue of export credit insurance generally has been informed by the findings of the 2009 report commissioned by my Department from KPMG consultants.  That report established that the introduction of a general scheme would be expensive, with significant on-going costs arising for the State.  Annual costs in respect of quite a low level of intervention in the export credit market would be about &euro;1.7m and this cost would rise significantly, if higher risk profile exports were covered.  In addition, it was found that such a scheme would be of very limited impact, and that a negligible number of jobs could be connected with such an initiative.  As the Government has a responsibility to ensure efficient use of scarce resources, it would be unwise to make a commitment to funding an initiative with marginal benefits for the wider economy and high level risks to the State.</p><p>  However, in the context of the wider issue of access to finance for SMEs my Department continues to monitor business needs, and will review the availability of medium term trade finance for SMEs, particularly in the area of working capital and performance bonds, in the current year.  Work on facilitating access to credit and finance will remain a priority in the context of the forthcoming Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-24a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012400047#WRA01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 44 and 54 together.  </p><p>  I very much share the concern of the Deputies in relation to the company concerned and particularly as regards the position of the employees in the company&rsquo;s Irish stores who have been understandably apprehensive about the future of their jobs and the payment of monies owed to them by their employer.  I understand that this situation has arisen due to difficulties across its operations in the UK and Ireland, arising from dramatic changes in the way music and films are bought and sold.</p><p>  On becoming aware of the evolving situation in the company last week, I asked the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) to contact the workers involved in the sit-ins and to mobilise NERA resources to answer queries from all workers on their employment rights.    </p><p>  My Department established a direct line of contact with the receiver from the outset and I was assured that communicating with staff would be a priority.  I understand that, over the weekend, the receiver secured the agreement of staff to discontinue their sit-in in return for his commitment to arrange for payment of wages this week.  The receiver has indicated he is making every effort to find a buyer for the Irish operation.  I understand that the receiver has issued employees with letters notifying them that they are on temporary lay-off, pending an outcome to his efforts to secure a buyer.  Redundancy notices have therefore not been issued to the employees. </p><p>  In general terms, I would note that under the body of Irish employment rights legislation there are significant protections afforded to employees whose employers are insolvent and as a result default on payment of wages.  If an employer is unable to pay wages and/or redundancy payments, employees are entitled to apply to the Social Insurance Fund - which is administered by the Department of Social Protection - for payment of the amounts otherwise due from the employer.  These rights are contained in the Payment of Wages Act 1991, the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Acts 1984 - 2006 and the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 - 2007.  The scheme applies to employees employed in Ireland in insurable employment whose employer is insolvent, as defined under the scheme.  Entitlements are based on pay up to a maximum weekly rate of &euro;600.  There is a limit of eight weeks&rsquo; pay for arrears of pay, sick pay or holiday pay.  Monies owed up to the appointment of the receiver are secured by the Social Insurance Fund.  Monies owed and earned after the appointment may be claimed through a Rights Commissioner under the Payment of Wages Act, who will adjudicate on the matter.  Additional protections afforded by the Protection of Employment Act 1977 (as amended) and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act are also of relevance.  The Protection of Employment Act contains provisions requiring an information and consultation process that must be entered into with employee representatives prior to collective redundancies being implemented.  An employer is prohibited from issuing notices of redundancy to employees during the mandatory information and consultation period.  Remedies are provided for in the legislation in respect of breaches of these requirements.  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 entitles an employee to notice of termination of employment of up to 8 weeks, depending on the length of service of the employee.  A situation of temporary lay-off may impact on the application of this Act and I would urge individuals to contact NERA to establish the position regarding their rights.  </p><p>  Accordingly, employees left without pay and redundancy payments by an insolvent employer are protected in legislation and are entitled to receive outstanding payments from the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the current body of employment rights legislation, backed up by the information and enforcement activities of NERA and the redress available to workers through the State&rsquo;s workplace relations bodies, provides robust protection for employees, even in these very difficult circumstances.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-24a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012400047#WRA01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 55 together.  </p><p>  Prompt Payments for goods and services rendered is critical to the effective working of any economy and is an issue on which this Government places great emphasis.</p><p>  In an effort to help ease cash flow difficulties for Irish small businesses operating under the current economic environment, while at the same time setting an example for businesses in the private sector to improve their payment record by paying each other more promptly, Ireland has introduced, on a voluntary basis:</p><p>-  A 15 days prompt payment requirement for all central Government Departments to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.  This arrangement applies to all valid invoices received on or after 15 June 2009;</p><p>-  A similar arrangement has now being extended beyond central Government Departments to our State Agency Sector to include the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (with the exception of the Commercial Semi-State bodies).  These new arrangements apply in respect of valid invoices received on or after 01 July 2011.</p><p>  The most recent set of composite figures published are for Quarter 4 2012 and show that 98% of Government payments, valued at &euro;1.25bn, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.  The Quarter 4 2012 returns also shows that 93% of Agencies&rsquo; payments, under the remit of my Department and valued at &euro;53.9m, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.  This clearly shows that central Government Departments, Bodies and Agencies and Local Government continue to comply with the Government requirement to pay business suppliers within 15 days of receiving a valid invoice.</p><p>  My Department promotes improved payment practices and monitors the operation of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997, and the Late Payment in Commercial Transactions Regulations 2002. </p><p>  At Present the issue of late payment is covered by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002).  Under these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest (late payment interest) on the amount outstanding. </p><p>  Ireland must transpose the Recast of the Late Payment Directive (2011/7/EU) which repeals and modernises the old rules.  Minister Bruton signed the Statutory Instrument transposing Directive 2011/7/EU was signed on 22 December 2012 and this will come into effect on 16 March 2013.</p><p>  The proposed legislation will act as a deterrent to late payment and as a driver for payment on time by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms.  It lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities.</p><p>  In practical terms, this translates into the following operational objectives:</p><p>- Confront debtors with measures that successfully discourage them from paying late</p><p>- Provide creditors with measures that enable them to fully and effectively exercise their rights when paid late.</p><p>  I am aware that part of the difficulty for small business relates to accessing working capital from banks.  A range of national initiatives have been developed to support the flow of credit to enterprises.  In addition to initiatives to recapitalise and restructure the banking sector, initiatives have been developed to build better business banking relationships (e.g. the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to SMEs and the establishment of the Credit Review Office).  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 will build on the recent achievements such as the introduction of the 15 day payment period across the public sector in general and the ability for business to attach officially new payment requirements to relevant invoices.</p></reply>

This is the most effective strategy to address the risk of emigration.  It is designed to achieve a transition from an economy which became dependent on activities that were unsustainable and where over 300,000 jobs had been lost in the three years prior to March 2011. </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs contained a wide range of measures: </p><p>  - Improving access to finance</p><p>  - Improving the supports for business and improving the business environment</p><p>  - Increasing the number of start-up companies</p><p>  - Securing and deepening FDI</p><p>  - Improving exports and the competitiveness of Irish business</p><p>  - Developing sectors of opportunity.</p><p>  This is just a flavour of the extensive actions which my Department and its agencies have taken to help the enterprise sector to create employment. </p><p>  We are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies.  2012 has seen private sector employment growth and significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant job losses. </p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs will be published in the coming weeks and will once again include a range of actions to be delivered across Government to support job creation. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-24a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012400047#WRA02000"><p>As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I regret any job losses.  It is an unfortunate reality that businesses can find themselves in difficulty for a wide range of reasons.  If my Department becomes aware of a potential company closure in advance, or if the business at risk is a client of one of my Department&#8217;s agencies, the Department or agency will do everything within their power to assist that business.  However, it is not always possible to prevent closures or job losses.</p><p>  A number of new measures of particular assistance to businesses under pressure have been introduced recently, including the introduction of the Micro Finance Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme, reform of wage setting mechanisms, allowing easier access to examinership, reducing employers PRSI and the introduction of a reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% from 1st July 2011 on a range of labour-intensive services, with a particular focus on the hospitality sector.  In addition, my Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to evaluate evidence on credit availability and to ensure that the amount of credit flowing to the SME sector is maximised to facilitate sustainable job creation and retention. </p><p>  The tourism sector is a particular focus of the Action Plan for Jobs reflecting the Government&#8217;s commitment to develop the sector by, for example, targeting capital investment in public tourism product and infrastructure, and using the Tourism Marketing Fund to support international marketing and advertising programmes.  Also, <i>&#8220;The Gathering&#8221;,</i> which takes place this year, will be Ireland&#8217;s biggest ever tourism initiative.</p><p>  The enterprise support agencies of the Department, Enterprise Ireland, IDA and the County Enterprise Boards are all alert to the need for business to anticipate difficulties and have developed various Programmes for process improvement, innovation, mentoring and skill development to assist companies in making necessary transformations.</p><p>  Despite a very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&#8217;s policies.  2012 saw significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant net job losses. </p><p>  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, and in that context, am exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation and retention across all regions of the country. </p></reply>

The Action Plan includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs for business generally and support job creation.  </p><p>  My Department and Agencies have undertaken several initiatives to support this objective, including: </p><p>- Reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms;</p><p>- Reducing administrative burdens by 24.9% in the areas of Employment Law, Company Law and Health &amp; Safety Law, amounting to annual savings for business of almost &euro;207 million;  </p><p>- Introducing a reduction of 30% in the fees charged by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to respondents to personal injury claims from &euro;850 to &euro;600;</p><p>- Reductions were also made last year in various fees charged by the Registrar of Friendly Societies to co-operative societies, and by the Patents Office for certain patents and design services;</p><p>- Publishing the Companies Bill which will lead to significant reductions in administrative burden for business.</p><p>  There are also a range of cost reduction measures being pursued by other Government Ministers through the work of their own Departments and bodies under their remit.  Examples include the freezing or reduction of the Annual Rate of Valuation (ARV) by 87 out of 88 Local Authorities in 2012.  Updates on these, and all other commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs, are detailed in the Quarterly Progress Reports on the Plan which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.enterprise.gov.ie.</p><p>  I am currently coordinating the finalisation of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government.  This year&rsquo;s Action Plan will build on the progress made last year and will set out a number of new initiatives to further reduce business costs and support job creation.  The 2013 Action Plan will be published in the coming weeks.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-24a.35.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012400048#WRB00400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 37 together.</p><p>  Many indicators are used to measure industrial output and the performance of the manufacturing sector generally.  For a rounded view, it is necessary to look beyond a single set of statistics; rather one should seek an assessment of all relevant indicators for that sector, in particular, output, purchases, exports and employment. </p><p>  In relation to Output, both industry production and turnover (sales) are relevant.  The recent Central Statistics Office data on these two activities up to November 2012 are disappointing but there are some sectors which show encouraging trends.  The most recent data for the last quarter has shown declines in both production and turnover overall.  However, the rate of decline in turnover has been substantially less than the rate of decline in production in recent quarters.  This may indicate that the decline in sales is easing and offers hope for a return to growth in sales.  During the last quarter, increases were recorded in both the production and sales of some key commodities such as meat and dairy products, computers and electrical equipment.  </p><p>  A key measure of industrial performance is, of course, comparative Export data for<i></i>manufactured goods.  The latest CSO data shows that manufacturing exports for the period January-November 2012 are almost &#8364;80 billion, which is higher than exports in the same period in 2011.  Considering the depressed economic status of many of our key markets globally, this is a significant achievement. </p><p>  In relation to <i>Purchases,</i> the reputable NCB Purchasing Managers Index is a composite indicator designed to provide an overall view of activity in the manufacturing sector of the Irish Economy and acts as a leading indicator for the whole Economy.  After a long period of contraction (some of it very severe) for most of the period 2008 &#8211; 2010 and also part of 2011 and early 2012, this Index has recorded 10 straight months of consecutive growth, up to and including last month. </p><p>  Approximately<i></i>50,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing in the worst years of the current recession due to a variety of factors particularly the impacts of the global financial crisis and the decline in demand for Irish manufactured goods, partly linked to the decline in the construction sector.  However I am pleased to report that since then Ireland has regained some competitiveness with decreases in relative prices and that overall employment in manufacturing has been largely stable over the last 2 years at around 190,000 to 200,000, with a roughly similar number of indirect jobs supported in this sector. </p><p>  Industrial production is crucial to economic well-being and, using the expertise of the Manufacturing Development Forum and the development of a new Strategy for Manufacturing, we can build a sound future for Manufacturing and Industrial Production in Ireland. </p></reply>

Ireland has built strong networks in key sectors such as ICT, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Financial Services.  IDA has informed me that the key requirements of potential investors in determining where they will visit and, consequently, where they will potentially locate tend to centre on the following:  </p><p>- Access to a pool of suitably qualified employees;</p><p>- The availability of world-class access infrastructure in terms of road access to key cities and ports and international airports;</p><p>- The availability of telecommunications infrastructure with multiple carriers and competitive pricing with business support services;</p><p>- Third level educational infrastructure including universities and technical colleges that are located on, or are close to, business and technology parks; </p><p>- A range of affordable, state-of-the-art property solutions; and,</p><p>- The attitude of the local community to potential investors.</p><p>  The Agency has also stressed that the combined influence of Ireland&#8217;s increased competitiveness in business costs, the Government&#8217;s commitment to maintain our 12.5% corporate tax rate, national infrastructure development and the Government&#8217;s continued investment in Science, Technology and Innovation have resulted in Ireland continuing to attract and increase the level of FDI  in Ireland.</p><p>  Finally, Ireland&#8217;s performance in attracting FDI has been recognised internationally and these international comparisons are impressive.  The IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2012,<b></b>which publishes internationally respected rankings, classified some of Ireland&#8217;s strengths as follows: - </p><p>- we are 1<sup>st</sup> for investment incentives; </p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup> for flexibility and adaptability; </p><p>- 4th for real corporate taxes;  </p><p>- 2nd for lack of protectionism; and, </p><p>- 4th for corporate tax rate on profit.  </p><p>  IBM&#8217;s Global Location Trends Report of 2012 places Ireland: </p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup> in the world for inward investment by quality and value; </p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup> in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development;</p><p>- 1st in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector; and,</p><p>- 2<sup>nd</sup> in Europe and 4<sup>th</sup> globally for the number of investment jobs per capita.</p></reply>

The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to those who are currently unemployed.  The Plan is a whole of Government plan with a national focus across all regions. </p><p>  While job creation is this Government&rsquo;s top priority and tackling unemployment is our greatest challenge, the most recent Quarterly National Household Survey showed that unemployment decreased by 3,600 (-1.1%) in the year to Quarter 3 2012, the first year on year decrease in unemployment in recent years. It is acknowledged that there are regional variances in the labour market, however, overall the unemployment statistics show signs of stabilization and some slight downward adjustment.  </p><p>  The Enterprise Development agencies are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and continue to ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic recovery and jobs growth.  Despite a very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies.  2012 saw significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant net job losses.  My Department has successfully delivered on national actions, such as the establishment of the Microfinance Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which will increase access to finance for enterprises and entrepreneurs throughout the country.</p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s plans for jobs and growth.  In November 2012, I announced that primary legislation will be drafted to dissolve the existing County and City Enterprise Boards and create an enhanced national micro-enterprise support model, delivered through Local Enterprise Offices to be established in each Local Authority area.  Pending the introduction of these arrangements, County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will continue to ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development and engage and work with micro-enterprises employing less than 10 persons, on an on-going basis, with strong referral to sister agencies to progress the needs of the businesses in their respective areas. </p><p>  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, and in that context, am exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation across all regions of the country. </p></reply>

The research also aimed to identify any other issues or difficulties associated with obtaining quotations. One of the main findings of the research was that a significant number of small businesses do not seek quotes in advance when dealing with professions or indeed experience difficulties in obtaining quotes when seeking services from providers in certain professions. Among the professions identified as posing difficulties for small business in obtaining quotations were solicitors, banking, accountants and insurance.</p><p>  Arising from its research, the Agency apprised the relevant representative business groups of the research findings and in particular the finding that a large number of small businesses do not seek quotes in advance when dealing with professions.</p><p>  In parallel, but as a separate exercise, the National Consumer Agency has carried out a number of initiatives in the area of price display. Included in these initiatives was an agreement with the Dental Council in relation to a format of price display by dentists by means of a Code of Practice which makes it mandatory for dentists to display their private fees for certain treatments in a place where patients can read it before consultation. A standardised format was agreed in April 2011 and took effect as a regulatory requirement as part of their Code of Practice on June 1st 2011.</p><p>  As regards the medical profession the Agency engaged with the Irish Medical Council and the Irish Medical Organisation in relation to the display of prices by doctors, following which the IMO issued guidance to its members advising them &quot;to prominently display a price list for a range of standard consultations&quot;. The Medical Council has advised that the price list will be considered for inclusion in the revised Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners.</p><p>  Following a survey of child care facilities, the Agency engaged with the representative body in that sector to progress a standardised price display format for its members to display in a prominent location on their premises. A format was agreed with the child care body and introduced in October 2012.</p><p>  As regards legal services, which the NCA&rsquo;s research found to be the profession in respect of which customers had the highest level of difficulty in accessing quotes, the Agency engaged with the Law Society to explore initiatives which could be undertaken to improve transparency in the solicitor profession in terms of its accessibility by both consumers and SMEs. Among the initiatives discussed with the Society was the introduction of standard templates for consumers seeking a quote for three common services such as making a will, obtaining a grant of probate and a conveyance. The Agency is hoping to conclude the discussions with the Society in relation to the possible introduction of standard templates shortly.</p><p>  Aside from the foregoing initiatives of the National Consumer Agency, it is also essential that consumers and businesses both embrace their own responsibilities to achieve the best value for money, through for example, actively seeking quotations from service providers. The research carried out by the Agency shows that whilst there is some evidence particularly in relation to consumers being more price conscious and actively shopping around for value, a number of businesses, particularly small businesses, need to embrace their responsibilities in this area much more proactively.</p></reply>

International surveys show demand in Ireland is largely the same as in other EU countries, but refusal rates are highest in Ireland. The data on new credit from the banks is particularly disappointing. We need a transformation in our banks from the old model based on property and commission earning, to a new one based on genuine relationship banking aligned to the needs of an SME sector seeking to break into new foreign markets.</p><p>  The Government have set the pillar bank lending targets so that they rise incrementally with expected demand, with targets of &euro;4bn in 2013, increased from &euro;3.5bn in 2012.  Both banks met the targets for 2012.  To ensure information on the demand side is accurate and up to date, the Department of Finance continues to conduct biannual surveys of SMEs to assess credit demand and loan approval rates.</p><p>  Work on facilitating access to finance will remain a priority in the context of the forthcoming Action Plan for Jobs 2013. As the Deputy will be aware my Department has recently introduced two targeted schemes to support an additional flow of credit into the economy namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme.  Other initiatives assisting business in this respect include the Development Capital Fund, Innovation Fund and specialist NPRF funds for the SME sector.</p><p>  My Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to evaluate evidence on credit availability and to ensure that the amount of credit flowing to the SME sector is maximised to facilitate sustainable job creation and retention.</p><p>  In October 2012, the Government commissioned a review of the Credit Review Office (CRO), in relation to the current operation, functions and supports provided by the CRO to meet the overall objective of determining whether SMEs are getting the support on bank lending they require. Officials are currently looking at how to implement changes to the CRO regime, in line with the recommendations of the report.</p><p>  An SME Funding Consultation Committee, chaired by the Department of Finance meets regularly to examine the various issues in relation to SME credit, and to identify further actions that can be taken to address the difficulties.  Officials from my Department participate on this Committee, and a work programme for 2013 is currently being finalised.</p></reply>

The purpose of restructuring the current model for the delivery of State supports to that sector is to rejuvenate and enhance the national model so as to ensure that the micro and small business sector is properly positioned to be a lead player in relation to job creation and to the economic recovery process.</p><p>  In conjunction with the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 a series of seminars were held across the Country at which I met with many representatives of the small business community. I also attended the Advisory Group on Small Business (AGSB), and met subsequently with individual representatives of that Group, all of which afforded me an opportunity to set out my vision for the LEOs  and to elicit their views on how the new model should be structured.</p><p>  In addition, I launched a public consultation process last November to seek as broad a range of views as possible on how the reform the national micro and small business support infrastructure could best be implemented. The closing date for receipt of submissions was originally 19th December 2012 but this was extended to 18th January 2013, because of the level of interest. Over 80 submissions were received and these responses will inform and influence the final shape of the LEOs and the services that the LEOs will provide. While acknowledging that there will be differences of opinion in any fundamental restructuring of Government supports, most submissions received made positive suggestions on how the new infrastructure could best be established.  Given the huge response to the consultation it will take some time to review and distil the submissions. All submissions received will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website in due course.</p></reply>

Initially, the Government allocated &euro;50 million of exchequer funding with the intention of leveraging a further &euro;100 million of private sector investment.</p><p>  In April last year, I launched an 'expression of interest' process inviting Fund Managers to submit proposals to Enterprise Ireland for commitments under the Development Capital Fund Scheme.  This expression of interest process closed last Summer.  Following an extensive due diligence process, the Board of Enterprise Ireland at its December meeting approved a number of commitments to Fund Managers, in principle.  These Fund Managers are now in the process of fund-raising and/or closing their funds, allowing them to commence investing in Irish companies.  The timeline for this process is driven by the private sector.</p><p>  The funds will be managed by private sector fund managers who will make investment decisions in the context of an agreed fund investment strategy.  The Scheme was established to create funds that would invest between &euro;2 million and &euro;5 million in medium sized established companies by way of equity, quasi equity and/or debt.</p><p>  In December 2012, during the Budget debates, I announced that the Government would extend the original scheme and allocate an additional &euro;25 million to the Scheme.  This allocation is targeted to leverage a further &euro;50 million from the private sector over the duration of the scheme, making a total of &euro;225 million in funding available to mid-sized indigenous firms with significant prospects for jobs and export growth.</p><p>  These Funds will be established and announced in the near term, and the fund managers will then commence investment.  It is forecast that approximately 50 companies will receive investment to support their growth strategies.</p><p>  At this point no moneys have been drawn down and it will only be following a period of investments that my Department will be able to assess the impact on job creation.</p></reply>

It is the largest exporter and source and recipient of foreign direct investment. Consequently, under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, we attach great importance to promoting the EU&rsquo;s external trade agenda. The overarching theme of the Irish Presidency will be the contribution of trade to growth, jobs and economic recovery. If, as is expected, 90% of economic growth by 2015 will occur outside the EU, we have an imperative to capture the impact of this expansion for EU citizens, workers and business. In 2011 Ireland exported &euro;173 billion in goods and services (&euro;136bn to Q3/2012, an increase of 6.18% on the corresponding figure for 2011), while total trade generated by the economy was just over 130% of GNP &ndash; one of the highest ratios in the world. This underlines the importance of trade and exports to both economic recovery and job growth in Ireland and across the EU.</p><p>  Two of the most significant trade agreements that will be progressed during the Irish Presidency involve the transatlantic economy. Free trade negotiations are underway and well advanced with Canada. Subject to the advice of a specialist group it might be possible to move forward with a free trade agreement between the EU and the U.S.</p><p>  EU &ndash; Canada</p><p>  The importance to the Irish economy is emphasised by the fact that in 2011, total trade between Canada and Ireland was &euro;2.2 billion. In addition, merchandise exports to November 2012 were &euro;740m, representing an increase of 32% over the corresponding figure for 2011. The EU-Canada Comprehensive Trade Agreement (CETA) negotiations are nearing a conclusion. Throughout the negotiations I have consistently emphasised to the EU Ireland&rsquo;s primary objectives in any trade agreement with Canada. These include both offers and requests to Canada in the agriculture sector, especially the beef sector, as well as other important areas such as intellectual property, investment, services and public procurement.</p><p>  EU-US</p><p>  Discussions are underway about the possibility of opening free trade talks with the U.S. Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency will prioritise these discussions and encourage other Member States to give the Commission a negotiating mandate to start talks.</p><p>  Improving EU-U.S. trade and investment arrangements in as many ambitious areas as possible, including services and regulatory alignment would be an exciting and worthwhile project from which Ireland stands to benefit significantly. The transatlantic economy generates $5 trillion in total commercial sales a year and employs up to 15 million workers. It is the largest and wealthiest market in the world, accounting for three-quarters of global financial markets and over half of world trade and world GDP.</p><p>  Other Free Trade Agreements</p><p>  We will also seek to achieve further progress across a range of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) currently under negotiation including with India, Malaysia and Vietnam. The trade aspect of an agreement with Singapore has been finalised and we look to advance the agreement&rsquo;s investment chapter during our Presidency so that the whole trade agreement can be finalised as soon as possible. </p><p>  We are also seeking to make important progress on FTAs with fast growing markets in Asia such as Vietnam and Malaysia as well as with the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and Armenia). Talks on these are at various stages of maturity.</p><p>  Trade talks that have yet to start include those with Japan and Morocco, the latter economy being part of the EU&rsquo;s Southern Neighbourhood. These are expected to commence shortly and very likely during the Irish Presidency. A trade agreement with Japan would be especially attractive for our exporters as that economy is both prosperous and technologically advanced. In other words an attractive market for our high value added and sophisticated exporters.</p><p>  We are also seeking progress in developing the EU&rsquo;s trade and investment relationship with China following its change in leadership later this year. This will include preparatory work on a possible investment agreement with market access provisions. Negotiations on this, however, are unlikely to start for some time yet.</p></reply>

At the end of 2012 there were 5 IDA Ireland supported companies in Cavan<font color="#FF0000"> </font>employing 1,000 people with 6 IDA Ireland supported companies in Monaghan employing 350 people.  In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to engage with these client companies in order to transform the existing FDI base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to promote Cavan and Monaghan as part of its marketing efforts, in response to specific client queries and also on an opportunistic basis for the purpose of winning FDI projects for the two counties.   The Agency has indicated that, in seeking to achieve this objective and the broader goal of securing new FDI projects for Ireland in a very competitive global environment, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require access to Metro regions which have a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one such Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve balanced regional economic development, the Agency prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by other locations on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway Economic Region has a positive impact on other Gateway Economic Regions and their surrounding areas. Recent announcements by PayPal and Prometric, which will create a total of 1,100 jobs in Dundalk, and by Yapstone to create 120 jobs in Drogheda, will have a positive economic impact, both directly and indirectly, on Counties Cavan and Monaghan.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to market the North East Region for new inward investment through its Gateway of Dundalk, in line with the Government&#8217;s National Spatial Strategy, and to work closely with its 34 client companies in the North East Region that currently employ 3,200 employees. During 2012, as part of its marketing activities, IDA Ireland began an online marketing initiative, &#8220;Connect &amp; Invest&#8221;, to showcase the unique attributes of individual regions to international clients and this initiative will continue to be implemented in 2013.</p><p>  Conscious of the current challenging economic circumstances that we must address, IDA Ireland is actively considering opportunities as to how to leverage its property portfolio in order that additional investment and employment opportunities can be realised in the regions, including Cavan and Monaghan.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantage in this regard has been gained by the pursuit and implementation of a range of inter linked measures which include:</p><p>  The creation of the European Single Market which ensures that foreign owned companies based in Ireland have direct access to an ever increasing European market;</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position as the only English speaking member of the eurozone and as a country whose commitment to membership of the European Union is very strong; </p><p>  The securing of EU support for substantial investment in Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure;</p><p>-  Significant investment in education by Government to create a pool of highly skilled young people;</p><p>-  Increased investment by both the public and private sectors to transform Ireland into a knowledge economy;</p><p>-  The Government&rsquo;s stated objective to maintain our 12.5% corporate tax rate;</p><p>-  Our increased competitiveness in business costs; </p><p>-  The ongoing positive experiences of foreign owned companies which quickly became reference sellers; and, </p><p>-  The responsiveness, agility and flexibility of Irish managers and workers.</p><p>  At the end of 2012 there were over 152,000 people employed in 1,033 IDA Ireland supported companies. The challenge for IDA Ireland is to sustain, embed and grow this investment. However, as Ireland is no longer a low cost labour location, it will be necessary for IDA Ireland to continue to maximize Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantage as it targets potential investors. In this regard, IDA Ireland is targeting companies involved in more knowledge based activities that are driven by technology and innovation, with an emphasis on higher skill requirements and R&amp;D. Drawing upon its experience, IDA Ireland is aware that the key requirements of potential investors, in determining where they will visit, and consequently, where they will potentially locate, tend to centre on the following:  </p><p>- Access to a pool of suitably qualified employees;</p><p>-  The availability of world-class access infrastructure in terms of road access to key cities and ports and international airports;</p><p>-  The availability of telecommunications infrastructure with multiple carriers and competitive pricing with business support services;</p><p>-  Third level educational infrastructure including universities and technical colleges that are located on, or are close to, business and technology parks; </p><p>-  A range of affordable, state-of-the-art property solutions; and,</p><p>-  The attitude of the local community to potential investors.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that it will continue to exploit Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantages as it seeks to meet these requirements with a view to creating 62,000 jobs over the period 2010 to 2014 in accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy.</p></reply>

In general, the business operating environment in Ireland is the same for indigenous enterprises as it is for multinationals. </p><p>  Through the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, we are focusing on policies that will support start-ups and help indigenous businesses to grow and compete, not just in the domestic market, but in global markets. These policies are about driving down the cost of doing business, ensuring the right skills are available and helping businesses to access the finance that is most appropriate to their needs, be it micro-finance, venture capital or development capital.   </p><p>  Multinationals are also an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s base.  Apart from the jobs they create and the innovation they bring to the enterprise ecosystem, they are a significant purchaser of goods and services from indigenous enterprises.  Indeed, one of the selling points used to attract Multinationals here is the quality, responsiveness and innovation of indigenous Irish enterprises, as pivotal suppliers of goods and services into the multinationals.</p><p>  Ireland has some of the most innovative enterprises in the world today, with cutting-edge, well-priced goods and services, competing successfully with other companies across the globe.  We have particular strengths in sectors such as software; medical technologies and food. However, due to the small size of the domestic market, Irish companies need to export if they are to achieve scale. </p><p>  A key part of the Government&rsquo;s plan for jobs and growth is ensuring that we derive more benefit as an economy, from the world-leading multinational companies that have located operations in Ireland. These companies currently source approximately &euro;80 billion in goods and services globally, of which over &euro;11billion currently comes from Irish businesses. The Government is targeting the global supply chain of multinational companies in an effort to help Irish companies win new business, grow exports and ultimately create new jobs. As I recently highlighted, a 5% increase in global sourcing by multinationals from Irish companies would lead to annual benefits of over &euro;500million for Irish companies.</p><p>  In this regard, a new joint Enterprise Ireland/IDA Senior Management team has been established under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, to drive this initiative. IDA Ireland has confirmed that its focus is on ensuring that each engagement with a client company, whether existing or new, includes, where appropriate, a discussion on the opportunity and potential for global sourcing from supplier companies based in Ireland.</p><p>  The 65 companies selected for the first phase of the initiative account for &euro;20bn in sales/exports and employ 27,000 people.  They have a total material spend in 2012 of &euro;5.25bn, of which &euro;0.5bn (9.5%) is currently sourced in Ireland. The value of their total services spend is &euro;6.2bn with &euro;0.63bn (10%) currently sourced in Ireland.</p><p>  There is a need in the Irish economy for both well performing indigenous companies and multinationals.   Each brings a unique contribution to economic growth, and both indigenous and foreign-owned companies provide valuable jobs, whether they are trading on the domestic market or exporting into global markets.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland clients have Development Advisors who work with them to identify what supports are most appropriate to assist their individual business strategies. In addition, Enterprise Ireland works with companies looking to export for the first time through its Potential Export Division.  In 2012 EI worked with 520 such companies.</p><p>  Furthermore, in 2012 in direct response to the demands of entrepreneurs and client companies, a number of new initiatives were introduced, including;</p><p>- Competitive Start Funds (CSF) for specific groups of very early stage entrepreneurs (investing &euro;50k per start-up) &ndash; more than 150 High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) and CSF start-ups supported in 2012;</p><p>- Working closely with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, EI initiated engagement with 118 members of the Global Irish Networks in relation to developing an International Mentor Programme.

The CEBs provide a range of financial and soft supports to businesses in start-up and expansion phases. Some of these businesses would be exporting while others would have the potential to export.</p></reply>

This developed as a result of the challenges facing the sector and of the imperative of supporting the employment levels in that sector. </p><p>  A key proposal in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> was that a <i>Manufacturing Development Forum</i>   be established to assist the Government in identifying the needs of manufacturing enterprises and to progress a transformation agenda.

In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to engage with these client companies in order to transform the existing FDI base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities. This is given particular emphasis in respect of client companies in Kerry, who are located outside of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main Gateway locations. </p><p>  The provision of flexible and cost effective property and infrastructure solutions is a key aspect in developing regional value propositions and in attracting FDI. In this regard IDA Ireland will continue to market all available land and buildings in County Kerry and work with local authorities and property developers to deliver appropriate solutions in response to potential investors&rsquo; needs.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in seeking to win FDI, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of a range of professional and business support services. Ireland has only one such Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve balanced regional economic development, the Agency prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region e.g. the Gateways in the Mid-West and South West Regions which include Limerick and Cork as the locations of critical mass.  However, the Agency also highlights the opportunities provided by other locations such as the linked hubs in County Kerry of Killarney and Tralee on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of the Gateways.   </p><p>  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway can have a positive impact on other Gateways and their surrounding areas. The recent Northern Trust announcement in Limerick, which will create 400 jobs, is a case in point as this announcement will have a positive economic impact, directly and indirectly, on County Kerry. </p><p>  IDA Ireland has also explained that, typically, a potential investor is shown three or four locations within a Gateway Region that can meet its requirements. In selecting such locations, IDA Ireland endeavours to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses. However, whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the client company based on its business requirements.</p></reply>

To this effect, there is on-going dialogue between relevant Ministers and officials, North and South, to promote economic development, job creation and innovation, in the border region. </p><p>  From my own perspective, I attend meetings in the Trade and Business development sectoral format of the North South Ministerial Council, which are held twice a year.  I also attend two meetings each year of the North South Plenary which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers. At these meetings there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, particularly at the sectoral meetings, where I have direct discussions with my NI counterpart, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on a wide range of issues of mutual interest.</p><p>  My officials engage in on-going dialogue with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI). A key area of such regular engagement is on the operation of <i>InterTradeIreland</i>  , the North/South Trade and Business Development Implementation Body, which is co-funded by my Department and DETI. All matters relating to the management of that body and the planning and oversight of its schemes and programmes, involve close interaction by the officials of both Departments.  Another key area of engagement at official level between our Departments is our joint support for enterprise projects under the <i>Interreg</i>   initiative, which is co-funded by the EU, by my Department and by either DETI or the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel. The most recent significant such project involves the establishment of a significant North West Science Park, to be co-located in Derry and Letterkenny, in respect of which both our Departments have agreed financial support.  Officials of my Department are also engaging with DETI in relation to work on the EU&#8217;s Regional Aid guidelines.</p><p>  There is a long history of co-operative action between North/South enterprise agencies to achieve mutual benefits. <i>Enterprise Ireland</i>, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes to drive job creation in border areas.  <i>IDA Ireland</i> collaborates with <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>, for example, in the <i>Northwest Now</i>  initiative.  Several of the County Enterprise Boards in the border area are engaged in co-operative economic initiatives with various bodies in Northern Ireland, some funded by the enterprise strand of the <i>Interreg</i>   programmes referred to above.

IDA has been working for many years to diversify the pharmaceutical base here in Ireland.  Patents on several blockbuster drugs expired over the last decade and, notwithstanding these developments, there has been continued growth in the sector.  </p><p>  In growing the pharmaceutical sector, IDA's strategy has been to win leading company investment and to diversify the breadth of operations over multiproduct sites, including associated services and development of new compounds.  We have been enormously successful in attracting eight of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies and the world&rsquo;s number one biotechnology company to Ireland. In addition, there are a large number of companies outside of the top ten who manufacture and successfully export from Ireland.</p><p>  The Irish pharmaceutical industry is an enormously important and highly valued sector in Ireland. While the industry has been faced with some difficult years due to patent expiration and competitiveness challenges, the industry is starting to see an increase in R&amp;D productivity with the advent of more targeted biotech therapies and personalised medicines.  2012 saw the highest number of new drugs, 39, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 16 years and the predictions are that the industry has turned a corner.  Ireland is in position to be the location of choice for development and manufacture of a number of these next generation drugs and the sector has been performing well in Ireland, with &euro;1.1bn of new investment announced in 2012 from five major IDA client companies, which will result in 1,200 jobs.  </p><p>  While IDA Ireland will continue to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s offering in the pharmaceutical sector, the Agency has indicated that it will also continue to focus on biopharmaceuticals, which represent the next wave of opportunity in the industry. Indeed, it successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from companies such as Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck, and Pfizer with the result that Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of pharmaceutical products.</p><p>  Whether available as a generic or a brand, global companies strive to ensure that the products they produce are produced to the highest international standards.  Ireland retains an exemplary global record in this regard with an excellent regulator in the Irish Medicines Board and with much improved competitiveness through wage reduction and restraint which is helping Ireland to compete with lower cost locations.  </p><p>  Additionally, Government agencies are continuing to invest in research and training to help the academic system support industry.  IDA Ireland, through its overseas network, remains committed to maintaining and growing relationships with key decision makers in the pharmaceutical industry and IDA Ireland can offer assistance to companies to support new investment and enhancement of technical capability.</p><p>  The overall export performance of the sector, therefore, is multifactorial and whilst there are challenges with regard to patent expiration, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to support continuous improvement and transformation in its existing client base while seeking to win new FDI opportunities in the pharmaceutical sector.</p></reply>

The closing date for receipt of submissions was extended to last Friday, 18th   January, because of the level of interest. I received over 80 submissions, including submissions focussed on mentoring, which are now being considered by my Department.

The purpose of restructuring the current model for the delivery of State supports to that sector is to rejuvenate and enhance the national model so as to ensure that the micro and small business sector is properly positioned to be a lead player in relation to job creation and to the economic recovery process.</p><p>  It is envisaged that some administrative savings will be achieved over time as a result of the restructuring of the CEBs, primarily from reduced rental costs, although these savings will be modest and could take some years to realise due to existing leasing arrangements. In addition, over time there will be some savings from the removal of costs associated with the individual company status of each CEB. </p><p>  Any overall savings achieved on administrative costs are to the ultimate benefit of the Exchequer. The Capital funding which is made available from the Exchequer to support the micro enterprise sector is ring-fenced for the sole purpose of assisting that sector through direct grant aid and targeted training and development and mentoring. The level of Capital funding secured in 2013 was maintained at previous years levels of &euro;15m and is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the micro and small business sector.  </p></reply>

These programmes help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness They  help grow sales and exports which in turn will lead to sustainable employment </p><p>  The Government is not only maintaining levels of investment ion STI at a very challenging time fiscally, but we are also seeking to maximise the impact from that investment in termsof jobs and growth. At the end of February 2012, the Government agreed to implement the recommendations in the report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group.  The report identifies 14 priority areas which, along with 6 underpinning platform technologies and infrastructure that support the priority areas, will become the focus of the majority share of competitive State funding in research for the next five years.  Implementation will see funding aligned with priority areas which encompass, amongst others, the areas of manufacturing and innovation in services and business processes., </p><p>  In relation to Manufacturing, this sector remains a key priority of enterprise policy. Forfas data shows that manufacturing employment grew by 1.1% in 2011, an increase of 2,198 jobs. This reverses a trend of four continuous years of job losses. There are currently 197,000 people directly employed in the sector. Employment growth in Irish manufacturing companies has been particularly strong in the Medical Device, Food and ICT sectors. </p><p>To address the challenges facing this sector, this Government&#8217;s <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2012</i> included a series of actions for the Manufacturing Sector including . a<i></i>  Manufacturing Development Forum, which is working to develop, along with Forfas, a long-term vision and Strategic Plan forthe role of manufacturing in Ireland&#8217;s economy aimed at reversing the recent employment trend and enabling a return to growth.</p><p>  1.In addition, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, working alongside Forf&aacute;s in the development of the Long-term Vision and Strategic Plan, has undertaken an in-depth study on the future skills needs of the manufacturing sector in Ireland, building on previous sub-sectoral work and undertaking new firm-level inquiry.</p><p>In relation to Services, this sector account for two thirds of total employment. While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, significant number are employed in Agency supported firms. The <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2012</i>   outlined a range of sectoral initiatives to facilitate new and established services companies to grow, with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services. </p><p>  I am confident that these measures, combined with other Government initiatives, including those to improve Competitiveness generally, will provide strong practical support to these important areas.</p></reply>

Between April 2008 and April 2012 the CSO estimate that there was net-outward migration of 41,000 for the 15+ age group.  As of April 2012, net-outward migration for the working age population was 34,000, made up of an outflow of 87,000 and an inflow of 53,000. Not surprisingly, these flows were largely accounted for by the under-35 category (68,000 and 30,000 for emigration and immigration respectively).  Net outward migration (emigration less immigration) for Irish nationals in the year to April 2012 was 26,000. There are currently no statistics available on the skills profile of recent Irish emigrants, although anecdotally a large proportion are working in the construction related activities in Australia, Canada, UK, Norway and, more recently, Germany.</p><p>  The impact of migration on the labour market and available skills depends on a range of factors including, for example, the age at which people migrate, whether they are of working age and their occupational skillset.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which is funded by the Department of Education and Skills, plays a key role in advising on future enterprise skills needs and emerging gaps.  The work of the expert group informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to provide interventions to tackle the skills shortages in particular sectors of the economy, e.g. Springboard, Momentum and the ICT skills conversion initiative, which was introduced as part of the ICT Action Plan.  In 2013, there will be continued targeted investment in over 430,000 part-time and<i></i>full-time places across the further and higher education and training sectors, all of which are open to unemployed people including young people and the long-term unemployed.  This investment includes the provision of the Skillnets Training Networks Programme, which is enterprise-led by nature, where the development of training is led by representatives of industry to ensure that training provision meets the identified needs of the network stakeholders and companies.</p><p>  This Government is setting about transforming the economy, firstly by making fiscal consolidation more job friendly, including through tax changes, asset sales and the creation of a stimulus package.  We have introduced the annual <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> process to support employment creation by the enterprise sector, based on innovation, entrepreneurship and exporting.  We have also developed the <i>Pathways to Work</i>   initiative to transform our engagement with those who are unemployed, including young unemployed people.  The aim of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of <i>Pathways to Work</i>   is to provide those who are unemployed with the appropriate training and skills to avail of the job opportunities which will arise as the economy recovers.</p><p>  Even with continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as Construction, and Financial, Insurance and Administrative activities, we have seen an increase in employment in sectors targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs, for example, Tourism Agri-food, ICT and Digital Gaming. These developments demonstrate the transformation which is taking place in the economy which had become too dependent on the Construction sector and domestic demand to support economic growth.  By continuing the process of transforming our economy step by step through the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>, we aim to provide opportunities for those who wish to continue to live and work in Ireland.</p></reply>

For example, fuel and energy prices are primarily driven by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices. In addition, currency exchange rates are important in creating relative price differences that can lead to higher costs for businesses in one jurisdiction compared to the other and this can have a particular impact in border areas. </p><p>  The Government&#8217;s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation. These include:</p><p> - reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms; </p><p> - reducing the administrative burden on business; </p><p> - placing downward pressure on insurance costs through the Legal Services Bill; </p><p> - encouraging all professionals to supply quotes in advance to business customers; </p><p> - providing supports to businesses to improve their energy and resource efficiency; </p><p> - introducing a mechanism to allow small companies to apply to the Circuit Court, rather that the High Court, to have an Examiner appointed; </p><p> - encouraging local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates.</p><p>Updates on these, and all other commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs, are detailed in the Quarterly Progress Reports on the Plan which are available on my Department&#8217;s website,   .</p><p>  The most recent report published by the National Competitiveness Council (NCC), in July of this year - &#8220;Ireland's Competitiveness Scorecard&#8221; - acknowledged that improvements have taken place in Ireland&#8217;s cost competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs. However, the NCC also advised that Ireland must maintain focus and continue to reduce costs to business.  I would point out to the Deputy that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to work for greater economic co-operation with Northern Ireland to accelerate the process of recovery and the creation of jobs on the island.  In that context, my Department and its agencies are working with their Northern Ireland counterparts on a range of issues as set out in PQ 3234/13.</p></reply>

IDA Ireland has confirmed that its focus is on ensuring that each engagement with a client company, whether existing or new, includes, where appropriate, a discussion on the opportunity and potential for global sourcing from supplier companies based in Ireland.</p><p>  Using data gleaned from an annual survey of the economic impact of companies in Ireland, which is undertaken by IDA and Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, in consultation with Enterprise Ireland has, to date, met with key clients to assess the potential market opportunity and how best it can be targeted and approached.  Arising from these discussions, a targeted approach is being piloted, concentrating on 65 companies which have the best potential to identify and secure global sourcing opportunities for sub-suppliers based in Ireland.  The 65 companies selected for the first phase account for &euro;20bn in sales/exports and employ 27,000 people.  They have a total material spend in 2012 of &euro;5.25bn, of which &euro;0.5bn (9.5%) is currently sourced in Ireland.

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, demonstrate that person&#8217;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue to him/her.  As regards the person in question, I can confirm that an application for a passport was received by the Department last August.  <font color="#004080"> </font>The child was born in Mullingar on 1 April 2009. His entitlement to Irish citizenship is subject to the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (the Act).<font color="#004080"> </font>The Act provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&#8217;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>  person&#8217;s birth.</p><p>  Moreover, the Act makes particular provision for nationals of EU Member States, who may make a declaration concerning their residence in the island of Ireland within the four years preceding their children&#8217;s birth.  In such cases, the EU national is regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of the Act, unless the contrary is proved. These declarations must be supported by documentary evidence (e.g. tax documents, bank statements, social welfare benefit payments, work permits, rent leases etc) to verify actual and continuous residence. </p><p>  The submitted application did not demonstrate the child&#8217;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. The Department wrote to the applicant&#8217;s parents on three occasions to inform them of this and to advise them of the requirements, which were needed to finalise the application to passport issue. It should be noted that attempts were also made to contact the applicant&#8217;s mother by telephone but these were unsuccessful.</p><p>  On 3 January, 2013 the applicant&#8217;s mother wrote to the Department and to indicate that they did not wish to pursue their child&#8217;s passport application any longer. The application was subsequently cancelled.</p><p>  It remains open to the parents to submit another application for a passport for their child.  However, such an application must address the identified failings of the recent application.  In this regard the following advice is offered:</p><p>  (a) the declaration made by either parent in respect of their residence on the island of Ireland must state the date of their arrival into the State.  This is important detail as it acts as a mark in terms of the four year review period of their residence prior to their child date of birth (i.e. 1 April, 2005 to 31 March 2009);</p><p>  (b) sufficient evidence must be submitted to show the parents&#8217; continuous residence during the four year review period.  The evidence submitted (i.e. payslips and a single P60) are the type of documents that are acceptable for this purpose.     </p></reply>

The Secretary of State and I, in accordance with normal practice, briefed the press afterwards.  We emphasised the need for protests to stop as well as our support for the PSNI who have been at the frontline in dealing with the violent incidents unfortunately associated with some of the protests.  The Secretary of State and I encouraged the First Minister and deputy First Minister to work with other Party Leaders in Northern Ireland to move on from the current controversy towards building a shared, cohesive and integrated society.  We also offered to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the good work done by the Executive and others on attracting inward investment and tourists to Northern Ireland is not put at risk.  </p><p>  While the numbers involved in the street protests are small, the eight week long protest has given rise to significant public disorder, major disruption of public transport services, interference in the daily routines of ordinary people, significant damage to the commercial life of Belfast and to the reputation of Northern Ireland as a safe place to invest and to visit.  I have condemned the attacks on the nationalist community in Short Strand and my officials are continuing to monitor the situation there and at other interface areas in Belfast very closely. </p><p>The persistence of sectarianism in Northern Ireland, with the absence of political agreement on how to make progress towards a truly reconciled society, contributes to the likelihood of incidents such as those we have witnessed in recent weeks. This crisis will not be resolved other than by a cross-party, cross-community response. I   am hopeful that party leaders will shortly agree on a framework for talks to address the issues that have arisen in relation to flags and symbols. These are political issues that require a political solution. The sooner a framework is agreed, the better. Moving forward, the focus of political leadership in Northern Ireland should be on maintaining and creating jobs through economic recovery, in which inward investment and tourism have such a crucial role.  The Government are ready to support the Executive and political leadership in Northern Ireland in whatever way we can.</p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election and his emphasis on immigration reform in his inauguration address sends a positive signal.  </p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   The Taoiseach also discussed immigration reform when he spoke with President Obama to congratulate him on his re-election.  </p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise. It is therefore not possible at this stage to specify its contents or identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

Ireland was represented at the meeting by the Minister of State for European Affairs, Lucinda Creighton TD.   The Council was briefed by the Malian Foreign Minister and the Foreign Minister of France.  The Council had a detailed discussion on the crisis and made important decisions on the EU&rsquo;s collective response in the period ahead. </p><p>  The Council adopted comprehensive conclusions.  These include a strong reiteration of the EU&rsquo;s condemnation of the acts being carried out by terrorist groups in Mali, which are jeopardising the country's territorial integrity and the safety of its population. In line with the relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions, support was expressed for the efforts being made by the region and by the international community in response to the request for assistance by the President of Mali.</p><p>  Ministers supported the rapid deployment of the African-led International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA) in accordance with UNSC Resolution 2085, and reiterated their commitment to providing swift financial assistance to that Mission. The Council called for the organisation of a donors' conference as soon as possible to provide logistical and financial support for AFISMA's deployment, as required by UNSC Resolution 2085. It has since been confirmed that this will take place on 29 January in Addis Ababa and the question of financial support by Ireland is currently under consideration.</p><p>  The Council adopted a formal decision to establish the European Union Training Mission (EUTM Mali), which will be responsible for providing the Malian Armed Forces with training and advice within the framework of UNSC Resolutions 2071 and 2085, and in response to the direct request by the Malian authorities to the EU.  It also decided to appoint a Mission Commander for EUTM Mali and invited him to speed up the plans and preparations so that the EUTM can be launched by mid-February.</p><p>  Ministers urged the Malian authorities to adopt and implement a roadmap for the restoration of democracy and constitutional order in Mali as soon as possible and encouraged a national inclusive peace-building dialogue. In that context, the Council reiterated its willingness to gradually resume its development cooperation with Mali as soon as the conditions in the roadmap are met. </p><p>  The Council also underlined that the EU is prepared to step up its support for the efforts being made by humanitarian organisations to assist people in need in Mali and its neighbouring countries. It underlined the importance of effective coordination between humanitarian organisations under the auspices of the United Nations, and reiterated the EU&rsquo;s appeal to all the parties concerned to allow unhindered humanitarian access to people in need, to ensure the safety of aid workers, to guarantee the protection of civilian populations and to comply with international humanitarian law and human rights. </p></reply>

The option will be available for three years from the passing of the 2013 Finance Bill which is expected to become law in early April at the latest.

The valuation date for determining the market value of the assets is, in general, 30 June of each year and the due date for payment is 25 September.  I confirmed in my Budget 2013 Speech that the levy will not be renewed after 2014.  The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government&#8217;s <i>Jobs Initiative </i>introduced<i></i>in May 2011.  The measures introduced as part of the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>  include a new 9% VAT rate on certain activities, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.</p><p>  The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government.  The measures announced in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> are aimed at assisting in employment generation &#8211; providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers.</p><p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  I cannot intervene in this process in respect of the pension fund referred to in the details supplied with the question or other pension funds.</p><p>  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed 0.6% of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme&#8217;s liabilities to that member.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999).</p><p>  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is or was wholly exercised outside the State.  In other words the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits outside the State.</p><p>  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent.</p><p>  I am conscious of the concerns of pension scheme members about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in our economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment very challenging.  However, much of the value of pension funds is attributable to the rolled up value of generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive.  The purpose of the levy is to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly.</p></reply>

My Department is liaising with Board of Management and their Design Team regarding a date for the Stage 2(a) stakeholders meeting.  Upon completion of Stage 2(a) and subject to no issues arising, the project will then progress to stage 2(b) which is the final design stage in the architectural planning process and includes the planning application and completion of tender documents.  The project has been scheduled to commence tender and construction in 2014-15 under the five-year construction programme that was announced in March 2012.  My Department does not hold information on the numbers of pupils in individual schools who occupy temporary accommodation.  This depends on the organisation of class groups by schools within available accommodation and may vary from year to year.  Local school management is responsible for organising class numbers year on year to achieve the optimum local efficiencies.  The school in question has seven prefab units.  The Deputy should note that such units may consist of one or more classrooms and/or ancillary accommodation.  The annual cost of the rental of temporary accommodation at this school is &euro;82,500.  My Department has asked the board of management to explore the potential for savings through a buy-out of the rental contracts.  My Department is awaiting a response from the school in this regard.</p></reply>

The scheme, which was implemented with the help of Sustainable Energy Ireland, allowed schools to apply for funding on a once-off basis to upgrade the fabric insulation in attics and the external cavity walls of their buildings.  The closing date for receipt of applications under this scheme was November 2009.  In light of the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of accommodation to meet rising demographic requirements over the next few years, limited resources are available for improvements and health and safety works in the existing school stock.  This is in line with the Government's stated aim of prioritising the delivery of additional accommodation in developing areas.  Therefore, my Department is not in a position to provide funding to schools to specifically carry out attic and wall insulation works.</p></reply>

Its research and reports provide a valuable input to programme development by education and training providers and has also informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision to address areas of emerging skills needs.</p><p>  The Springboard programme targets funding of free part time higher education courses for unemployed people in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages, such as ICT, Medical Devices and Pharmachem. More than 10,000 places have been provided under the two rounds of the programme to date. An expansion of the initiative was announced in Budget 2013 and it is expected that a new call for proposals for courses to be run under the programme will issue in February 2013.</p><p>  The joint Government-Industry Action Plan, which I launched in January 2012, was developed as a direct response to specific ICT skills shortages. The Plan outlines a range of short, medium and long term measures to develop a sustainable domestic supply of high quality ICT graduates, including through the roll out of over 700 places on graduate skills conversion courses during 2012. Due to very positive initial evaluation and strong industry endorsement  a tender for a second phase of the conversion programmes was issued by the HEA in November 2012. Details of the courses selected will be available shortly. In addition, 6,500 training places are currently being rolled out for unemployed people under the Momentum programme.

Details of these projects are also contained on the website. The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. </p><p>  Due to competing demands on my Department's capital budget, imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of essential additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements, it was not possible to include the project referred to by the Deputy in the five year construction programme announced. It is noted that enrolments at the school referred to by the Deputy have remained fairly steady over the past number of years.</p><p>  School building projects currently in architectural planning, including those projects not included in the five year programme, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available. Projects that are at application stage can only be considered for advancement in the context of the demographic challenges set out above.</p><p>  The Deputy might wish to note that since 2005,  under the summer works and emergency works schemes, my Department has provided funding in excess of &#8364;882,400 for various improvements to the school building including the replacement of windows, roof repairs, mechanical and heating improvements.  Funding in excess of &#8364;1.6m towards the provision of a new PE Hall was also provided to the school during the period 2007/2008. This funding is in addition to an extension provided at the school in 1999 comprising specialist rooms and ancillary accommodation which was granted aided by my Department to the equivalent of &#8364;1,178,282.</p></reply>

These programmes place a strong focus on active learning, community-based approaches, personal development and teamwork. Students also engage in work experience. In addition, enterprise is part of the Business syllabus in second level schools.</p><p>  The Sean Lemass Award for Student Enterprise is an annual award which is presented to the top 3 winners from both the Transition Year Mini-company Get up and Go Competition and the County/City Enterprise Board Student Enterprise Competition. In 2012 approximately 5,620 Transition Year students participated in the 'Get up and Go' mini-company Transition Year competition, an additional 4,322 students participated in an Enterprise module/mini-company.  Over 15,500 students participated in the Student Enterprise Awards with the majority of the students from Transition Year. This award is open to participants in both of the above initiatives.</p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle which will be introduced to schools on a phased basis from 2014 also provides opportunities to foster enterprise in schools underpinned by 24 statements of learning. These focus on what students should know, understand, value and be able to do at the end of junior cycle, having fully engaged with and participated in the junior cycle programme of their school.</p><p>  A number of statements of learning are relevant to enterprise, in particular, the one which provides that students should be able to take initiative, be innovative and develop entrepreneurial skills.  All schools will have to ensure that their Junior Cycle programme covers all 24 statements of learning.    Under the new programme, schools will be able to develop short courses for Junior Cycle as will other bodies.  Schools can choose to offer those short courses which they believe will best meet the needs of their students.  It will be open to local businesses to work on the development of short courses with schools in line with the guidelines and templates for short courses developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, if they so wish.</p></reply>

The Action Plan recognises the role that public bodies play in supporting the private sector and communities to create jobs at a local level.</p><p>  A number of significant activities which focused on supporting employment creation and retention at a local level were delivered over the course of 2012 under the Action Plan process.  For example, within my own Department&#8217;s remit, over &#8364;18 million was allocated to the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards to provide a range of supports to micro-enterprises and entrepreneurs across the country. </p><p>  My Department and its agencies engaged on an on-going basis with private sector bodies to progress specific initiatives that promote employment.  For example, Enterprise Ireland has been working with its client companies to improve access to public procurement opportunities for SMEs, while my Department has worked with the business sector to progress a range of sectoral initiatives in areas such as access toi finance, manufacturing, and the green economy.</p><p>  In June 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, launched a Local Government Sectoral Strategy to promote employment and support local enterprise<i>.  </i>This Strategy<i></i>outlines measures being taken by Local Authorities to assist enterprises in the areas of business charges, local enterprise supports, procurement, and local development and community-based initiatives.</p><p>  In December 2012, the Minister of State for Tourism &amp; Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, announced almost &#8364;26 million in new funding for local sports projects across the country.  This was the first round of sports capital funding in four years.  Many of the projects selected for funding under the programme will support local employment as sports facilities are improved and upgraded throughout the country.</p><p>  Government agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, County Enterprise Boards, Enterprise Ireland and Local Authorities also attend local events such as job fairs and exhibitions to provide advice to attendees.</p><p>  Recognising the important role that local communities play in job creation, the Government will continue to support local development in 2013 through a range of initiatives such as these across various Departments.</p></reply>

This initiative will provide a new national centre for innovation in the Cleantech sector, one of the fastest growing areas of economic activity and worth more than &euro;5 trillion globally.  The new campus, which will be a location of choice for Cleantech start-ups, SMEs and larger companies, is expected to drive significant green economy growth in the North Dublin and Leinster area, supporting 200 jobs over the initial 18 months.  The initiative is a great example of using scarce State resources in smart ways to drive job creation, and provides a model of what we must do across Government if we are to create the jobs we need. </p><p>  The remaining part of the site, comprising approximately two acres, was assigned to the Department of Education and Science, which plans to build an &ldquo;Educate Together&rdquo; national school to serve the local area. This is another excellent example of how the State is maximising its limited resources to facilitate the provision of important public services. </p></reply>

Policy has evolved over the years, as articulated in various Operating Agreements between the Minister and the CEBs, as well as through the County Enterprise Plans under the Local and Micro-Enterprise Development Priorities of relevant EU co-funded Operational Programmes.  </p><p>  As recently as January 2010, in response to the needs of micro-enterprises, a revised suite of supports was developed to provide the CEBs with greater flexibility in assisting these small businesses in the face of the economic downturn.  The new supports were also a first step towards aligning the CEB supports more closely with those of Enterprise Ireland and to improve the flow of clients between the CEBs and EI.  While the fundamental requirements in relation to eligibility of  projects for assistance remained focused on manufacturing and internationally traded services, a broader range of business costs became eligible for support.</p><p>  Since coming into office, this Government has demonstrated our determination to fundamentally address the challenge of supporting micro and small businesses. For example, we have introduced the Microenterprise loan fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme.  We are currently in the process of reforming the national micro and small business support infrastructure by dissolving the City and County Enterprise Boards and establishing new Local Enterprise Offices that will operate from within Local Authorities, but with clear oversight by Enterprise Ireland.  To this end, a new Microenterprise Division has been established within EI and this will become the national Centre of Excellence for supporting micro and small businesses, benchmarked to international standards.</p><p>  This fundamental reform offers the opportunity to revisit and refocus national policy in relation to the micro and small business sector with a view to ensuring that the state supports are properly targeted at that sector and that the LEOs become a &ldquo;First Stop Shop&rdquo; for micro and small businesses for the range of supports available across the system. </p><p>  The LEOs will engage will all local businesses and will offer a range of soft supports to those that are locally trading with a viable business proposition, including help with applying for a Microfinance loan.  They will also be well positioned to assist in the early identification of start-ups with the best potential to move into the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. In this respect, the Service Level Agreements between Enterprise Ireland and Local Authorities, that will underpin the new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), will include appropriate policy guidelines within which LEOs will operate in delivering enterprise supports. </p><p>Last November, along with Minister for Small Business Mr John Perry, I launched a public consultation process to inform this transformational agenda.  The consultation was extended to 18 January given the level of interest expressed by key stakeholders. </p><p>  Due to the huge response to the consultation it will take some time to review and distil the submissions, which will help shape the policy and operational scope of the new LEOs. All submissions received will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website in due course.</p></reply>

I understand that, over the weekend, the HMV<font color="#FF0000"> </font>receiver secured the agreement of staff to discontinue their sit-in in return for his commitment to arrange for payment of wages this week.  The HMV<font color="#FF0000"> </font>receiver has indicated he is making every effort to find a buyer for the Irish operation.  I understand that the receiver has issued employees with letters notifying them that they are on temporary lay-off, pending an outcome to his efforts to secure a buyer.  </p><p>  I would point out that temporary lay-off is governed by the Redundancy Payments Acts, which are administered by the Department of Social Protection.  I would urge HMV employees to contact the National Employment Rights Authority for information about their employment rights.</p><p>  In general terms, under the body of Irish employment rights legislation there are significant protections afforded to employees whose employers cease trading.  If an employer is unable to pay wages and/or redundancy payments, employees are entitled to apply to the Social Insurance Fund - which is administered by the Department of Social Protection - for payment of the amounts otherwise due from the employer.  These rights are contained in the Payment of Wages Act 1991, the Protection of Employees (Employers&#8217; Insolvency) Acts 1984 - 2006 and the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 - 2007.  Additional protections afforded by the Protection of Employment Act 1977 (as amended) and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act are also of relevance.  Accordingly, employees left without pay and redundancy payments by an insolvent employer are protected in legislation and are entitled to receive outstanding payments from the Social Insurance Fund.  </p></reply>

Ireland also improved its competitiveness ranking with the World Economic Forum, which reported last year that Ireland had improved its competitiveness ranking, from 29th to 27th place, in that organisation&#8217;s Global Competitiveness Index. </p><p>  Notwithstanding these improvements, the NCC has identified a number of issues which need to be addressed in order to achieve sustainable, long-lasting competitiveness gains.  The Council advises that the Government must maintain a focus on implementing a range of structural reforms across all sectors of the economy, including in relation to the labour market, competition policy, taxation, education and skills.  The NCC also highlights the importance of ensuring that our banking system is appropriately structured to provide an adequate supply of credit for enterprise.</p><p>  The Government has been systematically identifying those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 included an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to improve competitiveness and support job creation across all sectors of the economy. </p><p>  Updates on all commitments under the Action Plan for Jobs are outlined in the Quarterly Progress Reports on the Plan which are available on my Department&#8217;s website, <i><i>www.enterprise.gov.ie.</i></i></p><p>  Further measures to improve our competitiveness will be contained in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs which I am currently finalising on behalf of the Government.

The survey does not measure jobs lost and created in the categories of innovation and technology but rather in specific sectoral categories.  There are traditional sectoral categories which might not necessarily be regarded as innovative or technological but which would nonetheless be likely to have people employed in innovative and technological roles.  Similarly, there are sectors generally regarded as innovative and technological but will have a number of jobs that are not innovative or technological in themselves, e.g. sales, administration.  As innovation and technology are aspects of employment across most sectors it is not possible, therefore, to disaggregate the information as sought by the Deputy.</p><p>  The importance of innovation and the use of technology are recognised as core enablers of job creation.  Ireland is a small open economy which needs to have the export of goods and services at the heart of its economic strategy and in order for our companies to achieve success on the global market they must be innovative in order to differentiate themselves.  </p><p>  There are some 130,000 people directly employed in 1,004 IDA client companies and in 2011, the value of the foreign direct investment approvals achieved by the IDA that were research, development and innovation (RDI) based amounted to &euro;700m.  Indeed, some 70% of business expenditure on research and development is accounted for by IDA client companies.  Additionally, around 50% of IDA client company announcements in 2012 had links to Science Foundation Ireland.  </p><p>  The introduction of the annual Action Plan for Jobs process supports employment creation by the enterprise sector, based on innovation, entrepreneurship and exporting and recognises that delivering improvements in competitiveness and prioritising innovation are key drivers that will lead to jobs growth.</p></reply>

This is not necessarily surprising and it echoes what has been happening in most developed economies.  This has also been experienced in other industrialised countries such as Germany, UK, USA, Netherlands and Korea. </p><p>  It is clear that, arising from greater globalisation, reduction of tariff barriers and the ease of transporting goods, the nature of industry and the location of specialisations will be changing and there will be an inevitable movement of production of lower-cost, less-specialised goods towards cheaper labour economies in Asia, for example.  This is part of a wider global pattern.  Although it is very challenging in an internationally competitive environment, there is considerable potential for the manufacturing sector in Ireland, as we are strongly placed to create opportunities and employment in many higher- value sub sectors, for example chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food, amongst others.  </p><p>  Despite this trend, there are now 197,000 people directly employed in manufacturing (both full-time and part-time), and a similar number of people employed indirectly.  This figure has stabilised over the last two years.  It is noteworthy that exports of manufactured goods are continuing to rise despite a difficult environment.  Even more heartening is the fact that exports by the services sector are going from strength to strength, with an 11% increase in the first nine months of 2012.  In addition, the contribution of manufacturing to GDP has risen significantly over the last decade</p><p>  To promote job opportunities in this sector, the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 included several specific initiatives to develop the sector.  The Manufacturing Development Forum, which I established last year, has provided valuable insights into the sector.  I also asked Fortas to develop a new Strategy for Manufacturing up to 2020 and this study is currently being finalised.  A new report on the skills needs of the sector will also be a key driver in pursing those specific needs. </p><p>   The services sector accounts for two thirds of total employment.  While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, 125,644 persons are employed in agency-supported firms, an increase of 4.6% on 2010.  A total of 46,634 of these are employed by Irish companies, with growth particularly strong in areas including business services, ICT and financial services.  By concentrating on where our competitive advantages lie, in both manufacturing and services and building on last year&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs and the new Jobs plan to be announced in the near future, I am confident that growth in employment will be achieved.</p></reply>

These include employment-intensive services, new forms of foreign direct investment (FDI), investment from new high-growth markets and winning business from emerging companies.</p><p>2012 saw a strong performance in the level of FDI won by Ireland with 12,722 new jobs being created in IDA client companies.  This also represents a significant achievement in terms of reaching the target of 12,500 new jobs set in the Government&rsquo;s 2012 Action Plan for Jobs.  IDA Ireland has indicated that the gains made spanned a range of sectors, with particularly strong performances from social/digital media, IT, financial services and life sciences.</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s concentration on attracting employment-intensive services to Ireland is leading to the speedy creation of jobs.  A significant proportion of investments in 2012 were in the area of services operations, particularly serving the Europe, Middle East and Asia Market.  A notable feature of 2012 was the wide range of green field investments coming to Ireland.  In total, there were 145 individual investments, with 66 (over 40%) from companies coming to Ireland for the first time</p><p>In recent years IDA Ireland has established a footprint in high-growth markets, such as China and India, and remains committed to the goal of securing 20% of all green field investments from high growth markets by 2014.  The agency has also broadened and deepened its portfolio, embracing not just large multinational corporations (MNCs) but also working closely with &ldquo;fast growth&rdquo; companies, which aspire to be the MNCs of the future.  This strategy was successfully implemented in 2012 with a range of fast-growing companies announcing that they had decided to invest in Ireland.</p><p>IDA Ireland has indicated that, while the outlook for key global markets in 2013 is less favourable, particularly in Europe, which is a key focus for IDA&rsquo;s existing and potential clients, there are opportunities for growth in the IT/technology sector, in specific areas of financial services, in life sciences, in social/digital media and in sectors where consolidation is taking place on a pan-European basis.  The agency has assured me that its global team will continue to pursue these opportunities vigorously in 2013 and to ensure the organisation achieves its goals and targets as outlined in Horizon 2020.</p><p><b>New Jobs Created in IDA Ireland's Client Companies 2007-2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th><br />Employment Data</th><th><div>2007</div></th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td>Total New Jobs Created</td><td><div>9,372</div></td><td><div>6,766</div></td><td><div>3,582</div></td><td><div>12,178</div></td><td><div>13,381</div></td><td><div>12,722</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The most recent report, while acknowledging an improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, identified a number of issues which need to be addressed in order to achieve sustainable, long-lasting competitiveness gains.  Ireland must maintain focus on implementing a range of structural reforms across all sectors of the economy including issues relating to the labour market, competition policy, taxation, education and skills.  The report also highlighted the importance of ensuring that our banking system is appropriately structured to provide an adequate supply of credit for enterprise.</p><p>  The Department of Finance regularly commissions and publishes independent credit-demand surveys which seek to identify and resolve issues around the availability and access to credit for small and medium sized enterprises.  Arising out of the findings of the Mazar&rsquo;s survey published in late 2011, the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, accompanied by the Secretary General from the Department of Finance, held a series of seven regional meetings around the country to discuss access to bank credit with key local stakeholders.  These meetings gave rise to a whole series of positive actions to help small businesses to stay in business and create jobs.</p><p>  I regularly meet with small business owners across all sectors and hear directly from them what further measures are needed in order to incentivise them to retain and create jobs.  Also, as part of the preparation of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 which is now nearing finalisation, more than 55 submissions were received, containing over 600 individual proposals for consideration.  Many of these submissions made suggestions on how job retention and creation could be enhanced and where appropriate, ideas that were considered to be feasible for implementation this year have been taken on board in formulating the Action Plan. </p></reply>

While I acknowledge that upward only rent reviews are putting pressure on some enterprises in the commercial and retail sectors at the present time, there are other factors influencing decisions of individual companies to reduce jobs.  The retail sector has, for example, seen a disproportionate fall in activity due to the fall in consumer confidence and a reduction in discretionary spending by Irish consumers.  Allied to this, the changing nature of retailing has seen new patterns in the way people shop.  The growth of On-Line trading has impacted on the high street retailer, not just in Ireland, but in the UK also where there have been a number of high-profile retail closures in recent months.</p><p>  Following extensive consideration of the matter, the Government announced in December 2011 that it had decided not to proceed with legislation to abolish upward-only rent review clauses in leases signed before 28<sup>th</sup> February 2010.  However, the Government took steps to address the issue where possible.</p><p>  In this regard, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties and has published policy guidance which will inform the approach to be taken where tenants are experiencing difficulties in paying rents in these cases.</p><p>  The Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority, which is expected to capture information in relation to the rent agreed and other clauses within commercial leases agreed in the future.  I understand that work is underway to ensure that the Database will be operational at an early date.</p><p>  Separately, a Rent Review Arbitration Code was drawn up by a group of experts whose membership was drawn from all stakeholders in the commercial property arena.  The Code, which can be found on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality (), provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.</p></reply>

Irish exports have performed well in recent years. Developments in international markets have an important impact on the ability of Irish enterprise to create and sustain jobs.  Therefore retaining and improving the competitiveness of Irish enterprise will be central to continuing to grow exports and jobs.</p><p>  The entire focus of the Action Plan for Jobs is on improving competitiveness, transforming the operating environment, protecting existing jobs and supporting the creation of new ones.  An important factor affecting job retention and creation in indigenous companies in particular is their ability to access finance from both bank and non-bank sources. The Minister for Finance has set ambitious SME lending targets for the two pillar banks and has set up the Credit Review Office to ensure that viable enterprises can access finance.  I recently launched the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme both of which are designed to address specific market failures.  There are just some examples of what we are doing in this area.</p><p>  I am currently finalising the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government. As part of the process of preparing the plan I consulted with a wide variety of stakeholders, both in the public and private sector.</p><p>  These consultations took the form of meetings, submissions, letters and informal contacts with interested parties to establish what issues business were encountering in trying to maintain and grow their business, hire new staff and in their dealings with Government and regulatory authorities. I also sought to establish what could be done to make Ireland a more attractive country in which to do business, to help indigenous business to start-up and grow and to encourage further deepening and embedding of, foreign direct investment in our economy.</p><p>  The Action Plan will be published in the coming weeks and will once again include a range of actions to be delivered across Government that will improve the operating environment for business, improve Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and support job creation.</p></reply>

Her first payment went to her nominated bank account on 10 January 2013 and arrears due amounting to &euro;10,838.83 for the period 26 May 2011 to 9 January 2013 will be in her bank account on 31 January 2013.</p><p>  As it is the opinion of a medical assessor of the department, based on the medical evidence provided by the person concerned, that the claimant&rsquo;s condition may improve, her claim has been sent for a routine medical review. </p><p>  Invalidity recipients are routinely reviewed to confirm continuing eligibility.  </p></reply>

In addition over &euro;1.9 billion will be spent on child benefit payments in respect of just under 1.17 million children.</p><p>  The Comprehensive Expenditure Review, 2012 to 2014, published in December, 2011, provided for a reduction of a further &euro;540 million in expenditure by my Department in 2013.  However, the Government was able to reduce the net savings required for this year to &euro;390 million, &euro;150 million less than originally indicated.  </p><p>  This enabled the Government to ensure, for the second year in a row, that there was no reduction in primary weekly rates of payment, including OFP.  In addition, there were no changes to entitlements under the family income supplement scheme which some OPF recipients in employment receive or the rate or duration of weekly fuel allowance which is also payable with OFP.</p><p>  In addition, I also secured almost &euro;30 million in spending on employment programmes, school meals, childcare places and an area based child poverty initiative, which will benefit social welfare recipients, and in particular lone parents.</p><p>  However, in order to achieve the level of saving required in Budget 2013, it was necessary to introduce expenditure reduction measures including some reductions in child benefit. </p><p>  OFP plays an important role in providing income support to lone parents.  Changes have been made to the payment since its introduction in 1991, reflecting the changes taking place in society, the labour market and the expectations and realities of parents&rsquo; lives, and particularly of mothers, in terms of work and care.  </p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 reduced the amount of earnings disregarded for the purposes of the OFP means test from &euro;146.50 per week in 2011 to &euro;130 per week in 2012, to &euro;110 per week in 2013, to &euro;90 per week in 2014, to &euro;75 per week in 2015, and to &euro;60 per week in 2016, for new and existing claimants.</p><p>  The OFP earnings disregard has been a central component of the employment support policy for lone parents who are in receipt of the OFP.  Its objective is to contribute to the costs of taking up employment including childcare.  Evidence suggests, however, that while the earnings disregard has played a role in facilitating lone parents to enter the workforce, it may also have had the effect of trapping lone parents in low-paid part-time employment in order to keep their earnings below the disregard.</p><p>  The OFP earnings disregard was reduced to &euro;110 per week from 1 January 2013.  Earnings of less than &euro;110 per week are excluded from the assessment of means with claimants entitled to the full rate of payment.  Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50% up to a maximum of &euro;425 per week with a reduced rate of OFP payable.</p><p>  The upper earnings limit of &euro;425 upholds the employment support objectives of the scheme by ensuring that the OFP payment is targeted at disadvantaged and low-income low parents to assist them in covering their employment-related expenses, including child care, and to enable them to more easily assess the implications of taking up education, training, and/or employment as an alternative to long-term social welfare income support dependency.</p><p>  Finally, the abolition of the PRSI allowance does not affect lone parents who are on a low income as employees with weekly earnings of less than &euro;352 are not affected.</p></reply>

Following a review of continued eligibility, one of the carees in question was deemed not medically eligible for carer&rsquo;s allowance and the payment in respect of  this caree ceased on 21 November 2012.  Therefore the person in question is currently in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance for one caree at a personal rate of &euro;204 per week along with a payment of &euro;29.80 half rate for two children.  It is open to the spouse of the person in question to apply for an increase in his invalidity pension in respect of his spouse.  An application form for this purpose has now issued to him.  The rate of payment for a qualified adult on invalidity pension is &euro;138.10 per week, while the carer&rsquo;s allowance would be reduced to half rate which is currently &euro;102.00 per week.

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following his report on the Peatlands Forum.  It was also in line with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7 March 2012, which called on the Government to &#8220;engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency&quot;.  My Department has prepared an outline document detailing the proposed approach to the development of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.  The document is available on my Department&#8217;s website at .</p><p>  The proposals made at the Peatlands Forum identified relocation as a viable proposition for the majority of our raised bog SACs.  The primary focus of the national plan, therefore, is to develop a long-term conservation approach to each of the sites, with relocation options for those who wish to continue turf-cutting.  Financial compensation is also available to affected turf-cutters as an alternative to relocation.  Arrangements are now being made for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs and these have been finalised, or are close to finalisation, for a number of sites.  15 of the 53 sites will not require relocation arrangements to be made - for example, where little or no turf-cutting has occurred for many years.  Potential relocation options have been identified for a further 31 SACs, including the SAC referred to in the Deputy&#8217;s Question.  Work is ongoing to investigate the suitability of these relocation sites.  If, following an in-depth examination, there are a small number of SACs where there are genuinely no alternatives in terms of relocation, the national plan may be able to provide some flexibility in this regard.</p><p>  I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council and local turf-cutting communities, substantial progress will be made on the national plan over the coming months.  My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term resolutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law.  In addition, my Department has recently sought tenders for carrying out the necessary scientific research, which is essential to underpin the long-term conservation and restoration of these SACs and which will be required for completion of the national plan.</p></reply>

Following detailed research and consultation, the Panel submitted its report to me at the end of June 2012 which I subsequently published in July 2012. The report, which contains twenty four inter-related recommendations, set out a framework to provide solutions for affected homeowners.   </p><p>  In its report, the Panel was unambiguous in its conclusion that the State was not responsible for the pyrite problem and should not bear the cost of remediation. However, it was equally clear that the State had a pivotal role to assist and co-ordinate the provision of the necessary infrastructure to provide for the remediation of pyrite damaged dwellings where no other option is available to homeowners. It was the Panel&rsquo;s view that the stakeholders with direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem should face up to their legal and moral responsibilities and provide solutions for homeowners, including funding the cost of remediation.</p><p>  Reflecting on the approach recommended in the report for the engagement of stakeholders in processes to provide a solution to the pyrite problem, my Department and I have been involved in on-going discussions with key stakeholders and in particular with representatives from the Construction Industry Federation, Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, and the Irish Banking Federation since July 2012. My objective in engaging in this process, which has taken longer than I anticipated, was to achieve collective agreement for the provision of structures to deliver solutions for homeowners in line with the recommendations in the pyrite report.   </p><p>  The Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond have agreed to establish an entity for the purposes of operating the remediation scheme in respect of those homes affected by pyrite and where the homeowner has no other form of redress. A number of financial institutions have agreed in principle to make initial loan funding available to facilitate the early commencement of pyrite remediation work and it is intended that the entity will engage with those institutions in relation to this loan facility.</p><p>  I have recently received Government approval for the imposition of a levy on both the quarrying and insurance sectors, as recommended by the independent Pyrite Panel, in order to provide the funding necessary for the remediation of pyrite damaged dwellings. The imposition of the levies will require primary legislation and I am committed to having the legislation published and enacted in the shortest timeframe possible.   </p><p>  The Government also approved the establishment of a Pyrite Resolution Board which will have oversight of the operation of the remediation scheme and ensure that the public interest, and the particular interest of the affected homeowners, is well served. </p><p>  I am currently finalising the membership of the Pyrite Resolution Board. I have appointed a Chairman who, with me, is keen for the Board to commence its work as soon as possible. While, I am not in a position at this stage to indicate when the remediation work will begin, there will be no undue delay on my part or that of my Department in putting the necessary structures in place for a remediation scheme.</p></reply>

The Operation is the subject of regular monitoring and review by senior Garda management and is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts.</p><p>  Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven, and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders. These initiatives optimise the use of existing structures and local Garda management ensure that all personnel are fully briefed on the initiative, with Divisional Crime Management Teams playing a key coordination and implementation role.</p><p>  I am further informed that, as of 31 December 2012, 3,538 persons have been arrested and 1,924 persons have been charged as part of the Operation, showing that the Garda Commissioner is effectively deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted approach to confront those engaged in this form of criminality.</p><p>  In addition to this specific operation, the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime and is directed and supported each year by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Policing Plan.  Each Garda District and Divisional Officer also configures their policing response to local conditions to ensure that an appropriate policing service is delivered to rural areas. The Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with communities to enhance community safety in a wide range of local fora, including the Joint Policing Committees, and through programmes such as Community Alert which operates in cooperation with the programme partners, Muintir na T&iacute;re, and has led to the establishment of 1,345 Community Alert groups countrywide.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Older People Strategy reiterates An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s overriding objective, set out in the Strategy Statement 2010-2012, which is to prevent, detect and disrupt crime and criminal activity and to ensure that people feel safe in their homes, on our roads and in public places, specifically as it refers to older people.</p><p>  During 2012, the national Garda Supporting Safer Community Campaigns have continued to highlight key issues, in particular Crime Prevention. The first campaign took place in May and the second campaign, which took place in September, focused primarily on Burglary, Road Safety and Supporting Victims of Crime.</p><p>  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are developing further strategies in relation to the prevention and reduction of burglaries and metal theft.</p><p>  It is the Government's intention to ensure that frontline services are maintained at the highest level possible through the most efficient use of resources.  The Commissioner enjoys my full support and that of the Government in continuing to confront crime in all its forms.  I have every confidence that he and everyone in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deliver an effective police service in rural as in all other areas.</p></reply>

In all such cases, before a final decision is made, consideration must be given to the eleven separate headings set out in Section 3 (6) of the 1999 Act, the provisions of Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and other relevant legal and constitutional provisions. Such decision-making is also guided by, among other things, international law and Supreme and High Court Judgments. This process is followed equally in asylum related cases and in the cases of illegal immigrants.  The ultimate decision will be to make a Deportation Order or to grant Leave to Remain in the State for a specified period and subject to stated conditions.</p><p>  Before any non-EEA national can 'apply for Leave to Remain', they must be served with a notification of intention to deport, as provided for under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). However, it must be borne in mind that many of the potential 'leave to remain' cases, although having been served with such a notification, will have their cases finalised<b></b>  through the granting of Subsidiary Protection or the granting of permission to remain under different headings, such as under EU Treaty Rights or family reunification provisions or indeed through marriage to an Irish national. Additionally, some of the persons awaiting a 'leave to remain' decision will, for their own valid reasons, opt for voluntary repatriation, formally and informally, before a final decision is taken in their cases. The Deputy will appreciate that many other cases cannot be finalised owing to the existence of judicial review proceedings.</p><p>  Precise figures for each of the above categories, and for the numbers of cases which are currently awaiting a 'leave to remain' decision, are not be available without engaging in a very detailed and time-consuming exercise.  This would not be justified as it would have the effect of diverting case processing personnel from this area.  As the Deputy will appreciate the actual processing of cases must continue to be afforded the highest priority.</p><p>  I can also advise the Deputy that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in processing a cohort of repatriation cases, thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the Direct Provision system. I would expect to see significant dividends, in terms of cases finalised, from this initiative in the coming months.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that the processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international laws and jurisprudence, and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights. However, I am anxious that all cases are processed as promptly as possible and, to this end, apart from the legal panel initiative referred to earlier, additional staff members have also been deployed to this area of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in recent years. Moreover, substantial investment has been made in the development of technology required to support the processing of such cases.</p><p>  In terms of the time taken to finalise cases of this nature, no two cases will be the same in terms of their nature or complexity. Equally, cases will vary, depending, for example, on the countries of origin and the nature of family groups involved. The reality is that each case will have its own complexities which must be analysed in great detail, under a variety of headings as indicated at the outset, before a final decision can be made.</p><p>  Depending on the nature of the case, in some instances, a decision may be reached in a matter of months, whereas in others where for example there may be multiple legal challenges at various stages of the process it may not be possible to reach a final decision for a number of years.</p><p>  Furthermore, the current multi-layered approach to the processing of cases of asylum origin is not resource efficient and that is why I am providing for a single-procedure based approach in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I plan to progress in 2013. This proposed single-procedure will require asylum applicants to advance, at the outset, all reasons, protection or otherwise, behind their request to remain in the State. </p></reply>

This response includes the development of advice on the prevention of theft of farm machinery and farm security generally.</p><p>  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established a metal theft forum involving stakeholders particularly affected by this type of crime, including the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers association, the Electricity Supply Board, telecoms, transport companies, brewing concerns and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  The forum provides a means of on-going liaison and cooperation between all the stakeholders working towards preventing and reducing metal theft and thereby providing a safer and more secure living and working environment for both the public and the business community.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that following consultation with affected groups and senior Garda officers, the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Metal Theft Crime Prevention and Reduction Plan has been developed and will be launched in early February 2013.</p><p>  In addition the Minister for the Environment, Community &amp; Local Government has published draft regulations under the Waste Management Act which aim to enhance the traceability of scrap metal purchases.</p><p>  In relation to the operation of cash for gold outlets, I can inform the Deputy that on 19 June 2012 I published a report on the criminal justice aspects of this trade which was prepared by my Department.

That being said, I can also assure the Deputy that the 2013 Garda financial allocation, which in gross terms amounts to over Euro 1.4 billion, will be spent in the most effective way with the emphasis on the delivery of front-line services.</p><p>  In that general context I can confirm for the Deputy that the Garda overtime budget is Euro 43.9 million.  On any analysis this is a substantial sum of money and it also represents an increase of approximately 3.5% on the actual expenditure on Garda overtime in 2012, which came to Euro 42.4 million.  In addition, separate provision has been made in the Garda Vote in 2013 for certain Garda overtime costs that will arise in connection with the current Irish EU Presidency.</p><p>  With regard to the fight against crime, the most recent crime statistics published by the Central Statistics Office for the third quarter of 2012 show a welcome reduction in 12 of the 14 crime groups for which figures are given, compared with the previous 12 months.  The figures reflect how the Garda&iacute; are making an impact on crime and the Commissioner has indicated that the Force will maintain its focus on criminal activities.</p><p>  Overall, I believe that the primary Garda objective of combating crime will be continue to be achieved, and that, despite the pressure on the public finances, it will be possible for the Force to operate to the optimum benefit of our communities in a manner that will facilitate the prevention and detection of offences.</p></reply>

She was refused refugee status by the Refugee Asylum Commissioners, a decision which was later affirmed by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The person in question has sought to have the Tribunal's decision overturned by way of Judicial Review and that application is currently before the Courts.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the person in question on 26 May 2011 applied to EU Treaty Rights Section, INIS for a right of residence to be in the State. On 30 November 2011 the residence permission was granted for a period of five years until 28 November 2016, based on being a spouse of an EU citizen who was resident in the State and in exercise of their EU Treaty Rights under Statutory Instrument No. 656 of 2006 (as amended) which transposed Directive 2004/58/EC on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.</p><p>  It later came to the attention of EU Treaty Rights Section that the circumstances under which the grant of this derived right of residence had been issued were no longer applying and therefore EU Treaty Rights Section issued a letter on 4 January 2013 stating that Section's intention to revoke the derived right of residence and outlining the reasons why.  The letter also invited written representations to be made within 10 days of the date of the letter setting out the reasons as to why the derived right of residence of the person in question should not be revoked.  EU Treaty Rights Section are awaiting a response to this letter.</p><p>  I am not in a position to comment on the outcome of any intention to revoke the residence permission of the person referred to by the Deputy until any investigation by EU Treaty Rights Section is completed.</p><p>  Officials in my Department state that there is  no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy.

Its objective is to improve the productivity and profitability of participants&rsquo; beef enterprises by focusing on five areas: financial management, grassland management, herd health, animal breeding/welfare and producing animals to market specifications. Under the BTAP, participants engage in peer-to-peer learning by joining discussion groups which are facilitated by professional agricultural advisors drawn from Teagasc and the private sector. </p><p>  Payments to producers in 2012, which were limited to a maximum of &euro;1,000 per participant and subject to EU state aid rules, were contingent on compliance with Programme requirements, i.e. attendance at a prescribed number of discussion group meetings or approved national events plus completion of two technology adoption tasks from a menu of eight designed to enhance on-farm efficiency. The broad range of available task options allowed participants to choose those best suited to the business needs and particular characteristics of their beef enterprises.</p><p>  I understand that the individual concerned did not obtain a payment because he failed to satisfactorily complete one of two selected tasks which related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary surgeon. Participants who chose that task were required to join the voluntary Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories. Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland. </p><p>  The rationale for this approach is that the BTAP thus recognised and rewarded producers who tested their herds during the initial voluntary phase of a national programme to eradicate a highly contagious and costly cattle disease. Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animals born in 2012. Given that it is now mandatory for herd owners to take a tissue tag sample from all calves born after 1 January 2013, a producer should not entertain a legitimate expectation of receiving a BTAP payment for complying with a statutory requirement. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules. In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment. It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no Programme payment was possible in this case. However, subject to satisfying eligibility criteria, the producer concerned is free to participate in year two of the Programme, the opening of which I announced last week. </p></reply>

A range of relevant responses to the employment challenge are being pursued at European level through Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) and the Education Committee. </p><p>  Youth employment is a theme which I will be contributing to during my Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers through focusing on the potential of youth work and young people's engagement in youth activities and the way that learning complements more formalised systems of employment, education and training.</p><p>  There is growing recognition across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people, in particular for those not engaged in education, employment or training.  In particular, recent European policy developments suggest that youth work has the potential to do more and has a special relevance for those young people who are marginalised from traditional systems of education, employment and training. </p><p>  Youth Work (in its many manifestations &#8211; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering) engages young people over a relatively long developmental period from ages 10 to 24 and beyond. It works for young people at their own pace.  I see quality youth work as a commitment to continually ensuring and enhancing the optimum youth work provision and practice for youth people so that young people derive maximum benefit from their participation in youth work.  </p><p>  Ireland&#8217;s Youth Presidency Programme is seeking to maximise the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy and aims to highlight how youth policy, as expressed through quality youth work and youth activities, can do more to enhance a range of life skills including employability.</p><p>This priority theme will be advanced through the EU Youth Working Party&#8217;s work programme. I will invite the EU Youth Council in May 2013 to adopt <b>Council Conclusions </b>on the contribution of youth policy to addressing the goals Europe 2020, in particular, youth employment. These Conclusions will also be informed by the outcomes of the EU Youth Conference and Directors&#8217; General of Youth meeting which I am hosting in Dublin from 11-13<sup>th</sup>   March.  </p><p>  I also plan to host an expert round table event on quality youth work and its contribution to Europe 2020 and youth employment (20&#8211;21 June 2013, Dublin). </p><p>  My Department is also working closely with the Departments of Education, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify, in what ways, the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment.</p></reply>

This plan began with elimination of on-call in East Cork and is currently moving across other regions in Cork.  <i>On-call</i>   rostering means the crew is not on active duty, but is summoned in the event of a call-out. Average time for vehicle activation from call-out is over 20 minutes.  On-call is not an efficient or effective use of emergency resources and it significantly affects operational capacity, adherence to the Organisation of Working Time Act and health and safety for staff.  A risk assessment for on-call has been carried out and is to be included on the NAS Risk Register. Discussions are also pending with the Health and Safety Authority on its concerns over the use of on-call. </p><p>  The change to on-duty means highly trained paramedic crews will be on site in their stations or their vehicles to respond to dispatches immediately. The changes mean that resources can be deployed dynamically, based on need and demand patterns, rather than simply by station location. This allows for more flexibility and responsiveness and will produce better response times for the people in Cork and Kerry and a better service.  In the new model of service, on duty ambulances and response vehicles will move to the optimal location at any time, based on predicted needs assessments.</p><p>  The HSE has stated that it recognises the remote, rural location of West Cork and the proposed changes will be designed to suit the needs of this population. All of these measures will allow the National Ambulance Service (NAS) to provide a better, safer, more comprehensive and more efficient emergency ambulance service to the people of West Cork and to the Cork and Kerry region as a whole.</p><p>  The details the Deputy has sought in relation to to the operational arrangements for each station are a matter for the HSE. Accordingly, this question has been forwarded to the HSE, who will reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include clearly documented processes and timelines for the assessment of new medicines in as timely a fashion as possible. </p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducts a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) which provides detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine.  It also assesses whether the medicine is cost effective at the price quoted by the company in question. </p><p>The NCPE published its report on the cost-effectiveness of Kalydeco on the 21st   of January.  The report concluded that &quot;In view of the very high drug acquisition cost, the significant budget impact, the absence of long term clinical data and the fact that the company has failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of ivacaftor we cannot recommend reimbursement of ivacaftor at the submitted price of &euro;234,804 per patient per annum.  A mechanism such as a performance based risk sharing scheme and/or a significant reduction in price could facilitate access to ivacaftor treatment for cystic fibrosis patients with the G551D CFTR mutation&quot;.</p><p>  The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and will help inform the next stage of the process which involves further discussions with the manufacturer of the drug, in accordance with the aforementioned procedures agreed with the pharmaceutical industry.  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of Kalydeco that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  The HSE understands that patients, the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and clinicians are very anxious that a decision be made as soon as possible. </p><p>  No further comment is possible at this time as the decision making process is ongoing.</p></reply>

They will also qualify for premium payments and allowances on a pro rata basis, bringing expected average pay to approximately &#8364;25,000 per year, excluding overtime.  The initiative will enable them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.  The employment of graduates in a specific graduate scheme is a widespread practice in other sectors of the economy.  The rate of pay under this scheme is within the norms for such programmes.  </p><p>  Given the requirement to achieve reductions in staff numbers in the health sector and to maximise savings, it is not possible at present, other than in very limited circumstances, to offer employment positions.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has agreed that participants in the initiative will not be part of the Health Sector's Employment Ceiling.  The initiative therefore provides a valuable opportunity for a substantial number of recently-qualified nurses and midwives to work in Ireland at a time when job opportunities in the public service are, regrettably, very limited.</p></reply>

However the health sector has a role in terms of providing health-related supports to these children, where required. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive is currently reconfiguring therapy resources for children with disabilities aged 0 to 18 year, including those with autism.  Its <i>National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)</i> , established since 2010, seeks to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need, regardless of where they live, which pre-school or school they attend or the nature of their disability.  In practical terms this means that health professionals and parents will know exactly where a child should be referred and how to refer them.  Services may be provided at primary care level or by early intervention and school age disability teams, with access to specialist services, according to the child's needs.   </p><p>  The particular issue of speech and language supports that has been raised by the Deputy is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.
