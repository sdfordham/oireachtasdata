The allocation to the Local Government Fund for 2013 had already been decided before the LPT commenced and LPT receipts were not part of and were not planned to be a part of the Local Government Fund receipts and expenditure in 2013. </p><p>  The Commissioners have confirmed that by the end of December 2013 &euro;318 m had been transferred by Revenue to the Exchequer in respect of LPT.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Budget 2014 forecast that &euro;550 million would be collected in LPT receipts in 2014.  These receipts will be placed in the Local Government Fund which comes under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Under the Local Government Act 1998 which established the Fund, the Minister manages, controls and authorises payments out of the Fund.  Accordingly, the allocations from the Local Government Fund are a matter for the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  </p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that compliance data in relation to the LPT for 2013 are available broken down by city and county councils nationally and the most up to date figures are published and can be obtained  on the Commissioners website.  </p></reply>

Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion last year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets. I am informed that both banks sanctioned circa &euro;4 bn in lending in 2013.</p><p>  Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.   In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016, including lending to the SME sector.  Although the targets were a useful policy intervention, the focus now needs to shift towards the collation and examination, on a monthly basis, of more granular data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector. This focus is further underpinned by the commitments contained in the &quot;Access to Finance&quot; chapter in the soon to be published Action Plan for Jobs 2014. I will shortly be writing to the banks with a view to ensuring their continued commitment to work closely with my Department in facilitating a positive business environment in which SMEs can prosper and contribute to economic growth, in addition to maintaining and increasing jobs in this vital sector.</p><p>  In terms of banks meeting the needs of personal customers, the Government continues to work to create an environment conducive to the entry of new entrants, primarily through the implementation of policies to promote economic recovery and employment creation but also through different initiatives to ensure that there is an adequate pool of credit to underpin the recovery.  </p><p>  In this regard: </p><p>   we are working to manage and minimise potential market expectations of future State support for the State owned banks which could act as a deterrent to new market entrants; </p><p>  -  we are actively bringing forward new initiatives to promote alternative sources of lending and credit in the Irish marketplace, the most recent example of this being the link with KfW the German State Development Bank;  </p><p>- we are working to establish equality in the assessment of credit risk through the establishment of an industry wide credit register to allow for the appropriate measure of risk in lending, allowing incumbent and new lenders to lend with full visibility of the risk of that lending. The Credit Reporting Act was passed at the end of 2013;  </p><p>- we are working to reduce switching costs to allow customers to move between banks more easily, enhancing competition and forcing banks to work hard to retain their customers on a commercial basis;</p><p>- we are in regular dialogue with potential market entrants as they evaluate potential opportunities in Ireland and will be supportive of new entrants as they emerge. </p><p>   </p></reply>

The Pilot Project involved the 3 Irish retail banks - Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and permanent tsb. It is intended that those institutions will be involved in the roll out of the Standard Bank Account.  It will not necessarily be the case that the next phase of work on the Standard Bank account will be limited to these institutions and more extensive participation would be welcome to ensure that the broadest possible reach to the financially excluded can be achieved.  In that sense, the question of tendering does not necessarily arise at this point.</p><p>  The Financial Inclusion Working Group, chaired by my Department includes An Post together with stakeholders from other Government Departments, the Central Bank of Ireland, retail banks, the National Consumer Agency and voluntary sector organisations. The Report of the Working Group on the Pilot project noted the view of stakeholders that one of the key elements required as part of the preparations for a successful national roll-out of a Standard Bank Account is greater involvement by An Post and the credit unions.  This was seen as necessary to have the best possible channel for reaching the target cohorts. The Report also noted that barriers of existing infrastructure such as access to the clearing system had prohibited their more extensive involvement to date.  My Department is currently engaged in a series of bilateral discussions with the stakeholders in order to best determine next steps following the pilot.  The role of An Post is one of the issues which will be dealt with as part of this process.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-20a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022000052#WRA01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 38 together.</p><p>  There is an obligation on the Special Liquidators to ensure that maximum value is extracted from the loan sales process for the benefit of all the creditors of IBRC including the State. The sales process plan and timeline for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio has been developed following professional advice and in light of requirements for a robust and credible sales process in that context. The Special Liquidators have given significant consideration to and have sought independent advice from PWC in relation to how the residential mortgage portfolio is to be dealt with. Following that independent advice, the Special Liquidators have decided that the residential mortgage would be sub-divided into four tranches with a view to maximising market interest and return within the timelines set out in the Ministerial Instructions. I am advised that it is for this reason that the Special Liquidators have decided not to accept any bids from individual mortgage holders. </p><p>  Neither I nor my officials had any role in the development of the sales process plan for the residential mortgage book and given the Special Liquidators obligations to ensure that maximum value is obtained for all creditors of the bank it is not possible for me to interfere in such decisions. For example the valuation price for performing mortgages is likely to be much higher than some of the discounts suggested in recent commentary, it would not be possible for me to direct the Special Liquidators to dispose of these loans to individual mortgage holders at such discounts as to do so would erode significant value for creditors and leave me open to challenge.</p><p>  The valuation process for the residential mortgage portfolio was completed on 11 September 2013 and the sales process commenced on 14 October 2013. Following receipt of indicative bids, a reduced number of bidders were progressed to Phase 2 of the sales process which launched on 29 November 2013. The Special Liquidators expect to finalise the sale of these loans in March 2014.</p><p>  For operational reasons, IBRC loan assets have been grouped into a number of portfolios which have been ascribed project names Evergreen, Sand, Rock and Salt, Stone and Pebble; In total, there are 15,734 Borrower Groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the 7 portfolios. In total only 33 of these Borrower Groups, representing 0.2% of total Borrower Groups were/ are being offered for sale on a stand-alone basis. </p><p>  The first portfolio sale brought to the market by the Special Liquidators was concluded successfully in early December where the Evergreen portfolio achieved sales to third parties of 84% of the total portfolios at values above the independent valuations. The sales processes for the Sand, Rock, Salt, Stone and Pebble portfolios are all on going and it is therefore too early to comment on what percentage of each portfolio will be sold to third parties or will transfer to NAMA at the valuation price. However, the Special Liquidators are pleased with the level of interest shown by investors in the portfolios to date.</p><p>  The Special Liquidators will not be providing details of the discount applied to loan assets to arrive at the valuation price or the price at which the loan books are subsequently sold at as this information is commercially sensitive information which could potentially have a detrimental impact on asset recovery from the impending sale process. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-20a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022000052#WRA01500"><p>The Central Bank has advised that there is no such regulated category as 'sub-prime' lender but that phrase is sometimes used to refer to some non-deposit taking 'retail credit firms'. Retail credit firms are a regulated category of entities which are authorised to provide credit (in the form of cash loans) directly to individuals. Some firms authorised in this category are mortgage lenders. Retail credit firms have been subject to regulation by the Central Bank since 1 February 2008. A register of all Retail Credit Firms is available on the Central Bank website at the following link: </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) announced last March set time bound and measurable targets for the 6 main banks requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  </p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that retail credit firms are not subject to the prudential standards set out in the Central Bank's MART. However, the same consumer protection framework applies to retail credit lenders as to other regulated lenders including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). As such the Central Bank engages with these firms in relation to their treatment of borrowers under the mortgage arrears resolution process as provided for in the CCMA. In particular, the CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, dealing with borrowers facing or in arrears on a mortgage secured on a primary home and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their co-operating borrowers in mortgage difficulty.  </p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that retail credit firms were also included in the scope of the Central Bank's recent review of the 'Implementation of the Revised CCMA' by mortgage lenders, the purpose of which was to ensure that mortgage lenders achieved full implementation of the requirements of the revised CCMA by end December 2013.</p><p>  The Central Bank has advised this category of lender is putting in place solutions to address the mortgage arrears difficulty some borrowers are facing.  There are 17,807 principal dwelling houses accounts in this category of which 4,341 have been restructured.  In addition, out of the 659 buy-to-let mortgage accounts, the Central Bank has advised that 68 have been restructured.</p><p>  The Central Bank continues to engage with all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, in relation to lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and approaches to dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears.  </p><p>  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p></reply>

General Government Debt is a measure of the total gross consolidated debt of the State and it is this debt measure, when expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), that is the standard metric used for comparative purposes across the European Union. It is therefore more appropriate that we look at this metric. Data on General Government Debt is provided in the following table.<table><tr><th> -</th><th>General Government Debt</th><th>-</th><th>General Government Interest</th></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>&euro; billion</td><td>as % of GDP</td><td>&euro; billion</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td> -</td><td>-</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>47.2</td><td>24.9%</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>79.6</td><td>44.2%</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>104.5</td><td>64.4%</td><td>3.3</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>144.2</td><td>91.2%</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>169.2</td><td>104.1%</td><td>5.3</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>192.5</td><td>117.4%</td><td>6.1</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>205.9</td><td>124.1%</td><td>7.6</td></tr><tr><td>Source: CSO &amp;amp; Department of Finance</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>It should be noted that the 2013 figures are the latest published Department of Finance estimates of General Government Debt and General Government interest costs, from the Budget 2014 publication. The next official figures will be available in the EDP notification tables (Maastricht tables) prepared by the CSO and published by Eurostat on the 21<sup>st</sup>   of April 2014.</p><p>  Taking into account the buyback, in mid-December 2013, of &euro;4.1 billion of the 4% Treasury bond which matured on the 15<sup>th</sup>   of January 2014, the current working estimate for the General Government debt to GDP ratio at the end of 2013, is around  122%.

Other than a small number of staff reassigned from other functions within the NTMA, NAMA staff are employed on the basis of specified purpose contracts - their employment lasts for as long as NAMA requires their particular function. NAMA reimburses the NTMA the costs incurred by the NTMA in assigning staff to NAMA.</p><p>  The provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2013 were applied to the NTMA. Otherwise, the provisions of employment contracts are a matter for the NTMA.</p><p>  Employees assigned to NAMA by the NTMA, as is the case with all other NTMA staff, are subject to Section 14 of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990 which prohibits an employee from disclosing any information obtained while carrying out their duties as employees of the NTMA. Employees assigned to NAMA are also subject to a prohibition on release of confidential data under Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009.  NTMA employees, including those assigned to NAMA, are subject to the Official Secrets Act.  Contravention of these prohibitions is a criminal offence.  These protections do not cease at the point of resignation but rather apply indefinitely and extend to former employees.</p><p>  The notice period for NTMA employees assigned to NAMA is typically three months.  NTMA contracts for employees assigned to NAMA have a provision entitling the NTMA to place the employee on garden leave at any point during the notice period during which time the employee may not work for another employer.</p><p>  Following a review of its policy in respect of notice periods and post-termination restrictions on employment, which was conducted on the NTMA's behalf (as employer) by the law firm, Matheson, the NTMA is implementing a number of changes to its employment contracts, including the introduction of longer notice periods of 3 to 6 months (up from 1 to 3 months) for middle and senior management employees and garden leave provisions to be included in all new employment contracts.  In addition, a new provision is being added in employment contracts, where relevant, that restricts departing staff from performing services for a new employer, during the first three or six months following the termination of their employment with the NTMA, relating to a transaction or other matter in respect of which they participated directly or substantially in the course of their employment with the NTMA and were in possession of confidential information as a result.  In respect of NTMA employees assigned to NAMA, this provision has been introduced for all new employees and existing employees as they are promoted. The three-month notice period and garden leave provisions already apply to NTMA staff assigned to NAMA.</p></reply>

It is to the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and it also carries the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases it to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to higher rate of income tax arises. Only those on incomes above &euro;32,800 would be affected by the loss of the extended standard rate band. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the credit is more targeted, in that it is in the first instance, only available to the principal carer of the child. This follows on from a recommendation made by the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report. A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child is unsustainable in the current fiscal environment.  </p><p>  The new credit is designed to be an activation measure, which was the original intention behind the One Parent Family Credit, which it replaces.   It is designed to be an in-work benefit to support a principal carer to take up, or remain in, employment. </p><p>  It is important to point out that those families who care for a relevant child for the majority of the year will retain access to the new credit and associated extended standard rate band.</p><p>  This measure was discussed at length during the passage through the Oireachtas of the recent Finance Bill, at which I brought forward an amendment to allow the credit to be relinquished by a principal carer such that a secondary claimant can avail of it provided they meet certain qualifying conditions. The Government, by allowing for such relinquishing, where a principal carer chooses to do so for whatever reason, actually provided for an additional option for single person carers, over and above that recommended by the Commission on Taxation. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 was signed into law by the President as recently as 18 December 2013. Therefore, I have no plans to review the matter in the short term.</p></reply>

The survey for 2012 found that 13% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland are illicit. The comparable figure for 2011 was 14%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained, as a result of the extensive action being taken against the smuggling and sale of illicit product. A further survey was carried out at the end of 2013 and the results of this will be available in the coming months.</p><p>  The Deputy will of course appreciate that estimating the scale of any illegal activity and the resultant tax loss is difficult. I am however satisfied that the IPSOS MRBI survey is the best indicator of the extent of the market in illicit cigarettes.  This is because of the methodologies used and the consistent manner in which the survey has been undertaken over a number of years. In addition, the survey methodology is, unlike other methodologies such as empty pack surveys, capable of distinguishing between legal personal imports and illicit cigarettes. The survey is also geographically representative and, unlike others, takes social class, age, gender and nationality into account.</p><p>  In looking at the higher estimates of the level of illicit consumption that come from other sources, it needs to be borne in mind that the tobacco industry claims must be viewed in terms of their interest in minimising tax increases while imposing significant price increases of their own.  Data from the IPSOS MRBI surveys would indicate nominal annual losses in the order of &euro;258 million and &euro;240 million, in excise duty and VAT, in 2011 and 2012 respectively.</p><p>  I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that combatting the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for them. Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multifaceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combatting the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the state also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes to tackle the illicit trade at international level.</p><p>  In relation to tackling this problem in border counties in particular, Revenue advise me that they have an enforcement presence at key strategic locations in the border counties, and enforcement strength is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk assessment basis, or when particular operations against illegal activity are taking place. 10.66 million illicit cigarettes were seized in Revenue's Border Midlands West Region in 2013, and there were 15 convictions during 2013 arising from detections in the Region of the selling or smuggling of illicit tobacco products.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners will remain committed to acting against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products and will continue to make very effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities. A new multi-annual strategy for dealing with the problem is being drawn up, and the Revenue Commissioners will consult with key stakeholders in preparing this document.</p></reply>

The Commission  published its final Report in March 2012 and identified the financial position of credit unions in Ireland, stating that the declining fortunes of the Irish economy have not only put an additional brake on credit union development but have contributed to regression in some credit unions. To address this the Commission set out a wide range of measures, including, specifically in relation to the stability of the sector, recommendations regarding restructuring, stabilisation and resolution.</p><p>  A core recommendation was that the sector be restructured on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis to enable credit unions benefit from economies of scope and scale. The Government contributed &euro;250 million to the Credit Union Fund in December 2012 to support the restructuring of the credit union sector which is being overseen and facilitated by the Credit Union Restructuring Board - ReBo. Any funding provided to credit unions will be on a recoupable basis. ReBo is working to the timetable set out in the Commission's report and is expected to complete its work by the end of 2015. </p><p>  The Commission also recommended that a statutory stabilisation fund be established to address problems in credit unions that are under-capitalised but are otherwise viable. The statutory basis for stabilisation is in place under the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 and my Department will begin consultation on the introduction of the stabilisation levy this month. The target is to have a stabilisation levy in place by end quarter 2 2014.</p><p>  Another recommendation  of the Commission was that the powers provided by the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 should be considered for those credit unions that meet the conditions or grounds as set out in that Act. The Government has provided resolution funding of &euro;250 million. Funding will be based on recoupment over the medium term by a levy under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011. </p><p>  The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 implements over sixty of the Commission's recommendations which will help underpin the stability of the sector. The Act contains measures to reform and strengthen credit unions over four broad areas namely: Prudential regulation; Governance measures; Restructuring and  Stabilisation.  The Act is being commenced in accordance with the published Implementation Plan, which allows credit unions sufficient time to prepare for these changes.</p><p>  I am satisfied that these measures, together with governance and regulatory changes, introduced on foot of the Commission Report will underpin a stable credit union sector into the future.</p></reply>

Furthermore, if such a decision is made by the lender, the cooperating borrower has the right to appeal a decision not to offer an alternative repayment arrangement.</p><p>  Of course, the CCMA and MART can only work in circumstances where the borrower cooperates with the lender and engages with the process.  Where this does not happen, the lender may have no other option but to go down the legal route to deal with an arrears case.  However, if that course of action leads the borrower to commence a constructive engagement, this can lead to a more favourable outcome for the respective parties. The Deputy may wish to note, that according to information collected by my Department, in the case of private dwelling homes some 51,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of permanent restructuring following engagement between borrower and lender.  A further 21,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of temporary restructures.</p><p>  The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the Central Bank's MART process, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort and that every effort should be made to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.  </p><p>  It is important to point out, however, that even if a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013 now provides a power to the Court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) proposal.  In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that shall not insofar as reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy a principal private residence.  </p><p>  I have informed the Deputy previously that letters threatening repossession or legal action could not in my opinion be considered a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets, and should only ever be considered after every possible avenue for solution has been exhausted.

These services should ordinarily apply at the higher standard rate, which is the case in most other EU Member States.  However, as Ireland applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991 we are entitled to continue applying that reduced rate, provided it is 12% or greater.  In this context, it is not legally possible to apply the rate of 9% to tour guide services, and the short-term hire of cars, boat, caravans and mobile homes.  </p><p>  The 9% VAT rate on tourism related goods and services has had and continues to have a very positive effect on the growth and sustainability of that sector.  The most recent data available from the CSO of economic growth broken down by sector relates to the year 2012, and shows that there was a year-on-year growth in gross value added for the accommodation and food services sector, compared to 2011. Expenditure by overseas travellers to Ireland recorded an increase of 0.6% in 2012 compared with 2011. In addition, over the first three quarters of 2013 there was a 13% increase in expenditure when compared with the same period in 2012.   There is a clear impact in terms of employment in the accommodation and food service sector which has increased by over 16% between the period Q2 2011 to Q3 2013   an increase of over 18,000 jobs in seasonally-adjusted terms.  In terms of numbers of trips to Ireland, the total number was up by 7.2 per cent in 2013 when compared with 2012 and up 7.4 per cent compared to 2011. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-20a.58.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022000053#WRB01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 30 together.</p><p>  The issue of effective tax rates has been the subject of a number of Parliamentary Questions and discussions at the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform over the past 12 months. </p><p>  I think it's important to note at the outset that two separate issues are often confused in discussions on the effective rate of corporation tax.  The first issue is the global rate of tax which is paid by multinational companies.  This is a 'blended' rate and takes into account the amount of tax charged across all of the countries that a company trades in and not just Ireland. </p><p>  The extremely low effective rate figures quoted in the research paper referred to in the question are based on a flawed premise.  They are running together the profits earned by group companies in Ireland and in other jurisdictions and incorrectly suggesting that Irish tax does or should apply to both.</p><p>  The figures are estimated by dividing the amount of Irish tax paid by a total profit figure that includes substantial profits made by companies that are not tax resident in Ireland.  Ireland cannot tax profits that are properly attributable to other jurisdictions.  </p><p>  The ability of some multinationals to lower their world-wide rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.    The best way to effectively address this issue is for countries to work together at the international level and the appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of their project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Ireland is participating fully in this process.  </p><p>  The second issue is the effective rate of tax applying in individual countries.  Clearly, the domestic rate of tax paid in Ireland is within the control of the Irish tax system   and Ireland is responsible for the amount of Irish corporation tax that is charged here.  I want to re-emphasise that all companies operating in Ireland   domestic businesses and multinationals - are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here. A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land-dealing activities, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.</p><p>  There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax and there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure for this.    There are however a range of independent studies that show the effective rate in Ireland as being very close to the main headline rate of 12.5%.  The European Commission's Taxation Trends in the EU 2013   indicates an effective corporation tax rate for Ireland of 14.4% per cent.  The Price Waterhouse Coopers / World Bank 2014 report shows an effective rate of 12.3% for Ireland.  I know that the assumptions being used in that latter study have been challenged and I am not claiming ownership of the figures but they are examples of the way that different methodologies can produce different results. In response to the growing interest in the subject, the Revenue Commissioners now publish an additional explanatory note with their annual Statistical Report.</p><p>  The 2012 Revenue Statistical Report (which refers to 2011 data) indicates that aggregate net taxable profits, after taking account of various deductions, allowances, charges and reliefs, amounted to &euro;40.1 billion while the total amount of corporation tax payable on these profits was &euro;4.2 billion. This means that total corporation tax payable as a percentage of taxable profits was approximately 10.5 per cent for 2011. While this percentage is lower than the 12&frac12; per cent rate, this can be attributed to the availability of certain reliefs   such as double taxation relief and the R&amp;amp;D credit for example. </p><p>  The issue of effective rates of corporate tax was discussed at length at Committee Stage of Finance No. 2 Bill 2013 last November.  In view of the significant confusion around the issue, it was agreed that my Department would prepare a report on the matter to be presented to the Oireachtas Finance Committee by the end of Quarter 1 this year.  This report is currently being prepared and will likely be published upon completion.</p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the difficulties that the absence of such cover can cause to householders and businesses. While the lack of availability of flood insurance affects a relatively small number of people, the consequences for these people are serious should their house or commercial premises be damaged by flooding. However, neither I, as Minister, nor the Central Bank, have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals. </p><p>  The issue of provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the making of adequate provisioning to meet these risks. In some cases flood insurance is not economically viable for insurance companies and, in the interests of keeping premiums affordable for policyholders in general, insurers decline flood cover for new business for some risks, or, in certain cases, need to withdraw flood cover at renewal.  These are commercial decisions that insurers make having regard to the circumstances prevailing.</p><p>  My colleague, Minister of State Hayes at OPW has taken the lead role in discussions with the insurance industry about improving the provision of insurance cover in areas where remedial works are being carried out and OPW is near agreement on a data-sharing platform which will facilitate the transfer of detailed information on completed OPW flood relief schemes on an on-going basis. This will allow the insurance industry to take the flood protection measures into account when assessing flood risk in localities where such flood measures have been completed.  </p><p>  While the agreement on the memorandum of understanding with the insurance industry is to be welcomed as a first step, ultimately, it will be a matter for the insurance companies themselves to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence works but they are committing to take the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is to be expected that this will facilitate the provision of flood cover in areas that are protected by completed schemes.</p><p>  The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code sets out how the Central Bank requires insurance companies to treat consumers.  The Code obliges insurers to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and that they must act with skill and diligence in the best interests of customers.  The Code has a number of sections specifically dealing with insurance claims handling. The Central Bank of Ireland has no remit over the pricing of insurance products or the practices of insurers in relation to underwriting particular risks. Indeed the Central Bank, along with all E.U. Competent authorities is specifically restricted from doing so under the various European insurance directives.   </p><p>In cases where individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance believe that they are being treated unfairly, they can contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at .</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-20a.64.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022000053#WRB01700"><p>According to the consumer price index, private rents rose nationally by 6.0 per cent in 2013, following on from an increase of 2.5 per cent in 2012. However, this follows a fall of over 25 per cent between 2008 and late 2010. It is important to note that, on this basis, private rents are now at approximately the same level as they were in January 2003.</p><p>  The PRTB rental index, which provides a geographical breakdown of developments in the residential market, shows that monthly rent levels were up by 6.4 per cent on a mix-adjusted basis in Dublin in the year to Q3 2013. Rents outside the capital were down by 0.2 per cent over the same period. As a result, rents in Dublin stood 14.1 per cent below the levels seen in Q3 2007 (the beginning of the index), with rents outside Dublin down 23.4 per cent over the same period. </p><p>  As regards Real Estate Investment Trusts, I would like to highlight that potential benefits for property tenants were a motivating factor in the introduction of the REIT framework last year. REITs are specifically designed for the long-term holding of income-producing property.  They are not designed to hold development activities, or to be a vehicle for short term speculative gains, and so can provide greater scope for stable, long-term tenancies.</p><p>  The first REIT launched in July 2013, and made its first property purchases in October 2013, so there has not as yet been sufficient time to determine the impact, if any, which REITs have had on rental prices in Ireland. To date the REITs that have launched have focused on the commercial sector. My officials will be monitoring the uptake of REITs in the Irish property market, but it is not expected that REIT ownership of property will reach the level of concentration at which a distortion of competition in the market may occur.</p><p>  As regards the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA is funding both unfinished housing units and new development. It is estimated that approximately 4,500 residential properties will be completed and available for sale or rent in Dublin over the 2014-16 period through NAMA debtors/receivers or joint ventures involving NAMA.  In addition, NAMA is funding the completion of existing and the development of new residential developments in the main urban areas to which it has an exposure.  NAMA is working closely with the various local authorities in this respect.  NAMA has indicated that in many instances, planning issues and other obstacles need to be resolved to facilitate the delivery of new residential supply.</p><p>  In summary, I wish to assure the deputy that my Department will continue to monitor developments in the property and rental markets. As set out in the Government's Medium Term Economic Strategy, the Government will continue to work on addressing remaining challenges in the property and construction sectors. This will include developing an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing further improvements in the planning process to facilitate appropriate development, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision.</p></reply>

Discussions at Eurogroup have focussed on the establishment of the ESM's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument (DRI) which will provide the source for any possible future retrospective recapitalisation.  </p><p>  The Eurogroup meeting on 20<sup>th</sup>   June 2013 referred to above agreed on the main features of the European Stability Mechanism's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument or DRI. There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. </p><p>  Finally, both I and my Government colleagues will ensure that Ireland's case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.  I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-20a.71.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022000053#WRB02200"><p>I accept that the level of competition in the Irish banking sector has reduced as a result of the recent decisions by ACC and Danske Bank to withdraw, following the withdrawal of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) some time ago.   Over time, I expect that the restructuring of the banking sector and the recovery of the economy will present opportunities for the entry of new market participants well positioned to be confident in the future profitability of an Irish branch or subsidiary.     The Government continues to work to create an environment conducive to the entry of such new entrants through a number of initiatives and have led the debate at EU level on the mechanisms to promote alternative forms of financing for SMEs. </p><p>   The Government has also taken steps to ensure that the Irish financial market is accessible to any financial institution considering establishing in Ireland. In seeking to reduce the barriers to entry which are specific to the Irish banking market, Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act (as amended), which provides for the regulation of bank fees and commissions has been disapplied for three years in the case of new financial service providers setting up in Ireland.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware bank fees and charges are subject to regulation under Section 149. This section came into effect in 1996 and currently requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make an application to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce  new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not cover interest rates; it applies to fees and commissions  only. </p><p>  My Department recently published a review of the regulation of bank fees and charges which is available on its website . The review concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal section 149 at this time. The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the removal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.  However, the report recommended that the  issue should be revisited when competition in the banking sector has improved significantly.  It is my view that the current regulatory regime offers appropriate protection to consumers against unjustified increases in bank fees and commissions.</p><p>   It is true that Ireland continues to rely heavily on cash and other paper payment instruments. This has significant implications for cost competitiveness, security and consumer choice in Ireland. The efficiency of Ireland's payment systems infrastructure could be improved if greater use were made of secure and efficient electronic payments, leading to a reduction in the proportion of transactions involving cash and cheques. The Deputy will be aware of eDay which is on 19 September 2014. The announcement of eDay was made by Minister of State Brian Hayes last September so as to give Government Departments, Local Authorities and other state agencies sufficient time to prepare for it. eDay is the day from which these authorities will no longer accept cash or cheques from businesses or make payment to businesses by way of cheques. It is expected that this initiative will yield savings to the authorities and, alike, to the businesses.</p></reply>

For instance, for rented property the cost to landlords, but not tenants, of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property would be tax deductible. Other options available would include:</p><p>  The Home Renovation Incentive, introduced in the recent Finance Act, provides for tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a homeowner's only or main residence.

Examples include the identification of over 4,400 houses and apartments for social housing and the establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle to facilitate long-term leasing of these properties by approved housing bodies; the identification of more than 70 sites for new schools; and the identification of sites and buildings for primary health care centres and other step-down and community health care facilities.</p><p>  In addition to NAMA's on-going engagement with public bodies in relation to specific initiatives, such as social housing, it is open to any public body to identify its interest in lands and property securing the Agency's loans.</p><p>  I believe the approach determined by NAMA's Board is contributing in terms of its primary commercial objective, while at the same time contributing to the achievement of wider public policy objectives.  In light of this I do not intend to intervene, through legislative amendment or otherwise, in NAMA's positive work in this area.</p></reply>

I know that Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to maintain a clear focus and organise their financial affairs to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. I know that Revenue is conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate and how it impacts on business in being timely compliant. For example, Revenue has actively encouraged businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise to find an agreed way through the difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.</p><p>  As I have advised the Deputy in reply to previous questions on this issue, I am informed by Revenue that Sheriffs are officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945. Their debt collection activities are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended and the execution of Revenue certificates is specifically provided for in Section 960L of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997, as amended. Once a certificate relating to an unpaid tax debt has been issued to a Sheriff, the taxpayer becomes liable for payment of the associated Sheriff's fees and costs. The current fee structure came into effect on 1 November 2005 and is set out in the Sheriffs Fees and Expenses Order, 2005. When acting in execution of tax certificates, Sheriffs are governed by the general law, which applies to the collection of civil debts of all kinds, and not by the provisions of the Tax Acts. They are not accountable to Revenue as regards the methods and techniques of enforcement but are answerable before the courts for any breach of the civil debt collection law.  Accordingly the data requested by the Deputy is not available to Revenue or to my Department.  I am advised however that Revenue understands that Sheriffs only undertake seizures in a very small minority of cases and only after the defaulting taxpayer has not complied with requests for payment.</p><p>  Sheriffs remit all monies, after deduction of their fees and expenses, collected from taxpayers in respect of the certificates issued to them to Revenue for appropriation against the taxpayers' accounts and transfer to the Exchequer. A table is included at Appendix 1 showing the details of the numbers, values and amounts collected in respect of certificates issued to Sheriffs in each of the last five years.</p><p>  Again as I have previously informed the Deputy, I understand that the Sheriffs operate a Code of Practice, available from any Sheriff or on Revenue's website, which sets out how Sheriffs will engage with taxpayers in relation to their tax collection enforcement activities. For example, it includes commitments that when goods are seized a written inventory will be supplied to the taxpayer as soon as possible, and there is a commitment to furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized. The Code also sets out the process whereby a taxpayer may make a complaint and how it will be handled.</p><p>  Finally, I am satisfied that the Sheriff operation continues to make a very significant contribution to the overall effectiveness of Revenue's collection enforcement programmes.</p><p>  Appendix 1<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. of Certificates Issued by Revenue to Sheriffs</th><th>Value of Certificates(m)</th><th>Tax / Interest Collected(m)</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>38,790</td><td>&euro;697.4</td><td>&euro;214.3</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>32,964</td><td>&euro;529.0</td><td>&euro;173.9</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>34,466</td><td>&euro;474.3</td><td>&euro;172.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>31,065</td><td>&euro;373.6</td><td>&euro;151.3</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>28,795</td><td>&euro;312.0</td><td>&euro;150.2</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware the timeline for approval of a Restructuring Plan (for Permanent TSB or any other entity) is a matter for the Commission and I do not intend to speculate on when that process might be concluded.</p><p>  Permanent TSB has made significant progress in delivering key elements of its Restructuring Plan over the last year. Permanent TSB continues to work to enhance the value of our investments through the continued delivery of the Restructuring Plan, which will, if delivered, provide the State with more optionality regarding the future structure of Permanent TSB.</p><p>   During 2013 Permanent TSB grew its presence and activity in the retail market in general and in the current account and deposit markets in particular, as well as in mortgages and term lending; and it launched several new products during the year. As the Deputy may be aware Permanent TSB is due to report its performance for 2013 in late March and while it is not appropriate to divulge details of performance in advance of that, the results, when announced, will demonstrate that Permanent TSB was a meaningful player in these segments in 2013. For example I am advised by Permanent TSB that its level of new mortgage lending more than doubled in 2013 compared to 2012.</p><p>  Permanent TSB has also made progress in relation to managing its portfolio of mortgages in arrears and has created a dedicated team to deal with those customers and to roll out various solutions to them. I am advised by Permanent TSB that during 2013 it made approximately 22,000 offers of sustainable solutions to customers in arrears or having difficulty with their mortgage repayments.</p></reply>

Under these provisions fuel purchased other than in bulk or through an approved fuel card is not covered by the scheme.</p><p>  Purchases in bulk by the qualifying transport operator must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and be delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of that road transport operator. Purchases by means of a fuel card, approved by Revenue for that purpose, may also qualify for repayment and there is no minimum requirement on purchases made in this way.  A fuel card will be approved where Revenue is satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply it electronically with information about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card and subsequently claimed under the scheme. There are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.</p><p>  As part of the risk control measures under the scheme, claimants must register for and claim repayments electronically through Revenue's on-line system (ROS). This enables Revenue to take advantage of third party information to verify claims automatically. Bulk claims are verified against the monthly returns submitted by licensed mineral oil traders to Revenue under the supply chain controls introduced to tackle fuel laundering. This return shows information on all fuel transactions by the mineral oil trader during the month greater than 2000 litres, including such transactions with the qualifying transport operators. Claims for fuel purchased by way of a fuel card can be verified against the information supplied to Revenue by the fuel card provider. In addition to third party verification of claims, these arrangements allow Revenue to carry out extensive data analysis to identify suspicious claims and transactions, another aspect of Revenue's risk control framework.</p><p>  The scheme provides for repayments of mineral oil tax under specific conditions that do not apply to the very different requirements of input credit under the VAT system.  Claims made on the basis of VAT receipts would be costly to administer and would not provide sufficient assurance against the risk of fraudulent claims. In the first instance, claims would not be verifiable, automatically and in real time, against third party data from the fuel card providers and mineral oil traders. Instead, Revenue would be obliged to check such claims manually and these checks would be highly resource-intensive, necessarily limited, and cause lengthy delays in processing legitimate claims. I believe that the current arrangements find the right balance between facilitating compliant transport operators and controlling the risk of fraud.</p><p>  The requirements of the scheme, including those relating to fuel purchases, were explained at length during meetings between Revenue and representative bodies of the transport operators prior to its commencement.  Detailed information on the application of the scheme is published on .</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences based on a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p><p>  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016. Works are completed on a prioritised basis. Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.</p><p>  My colleague, Minister of State Hayes at the Office of Public Works has taken the lead role in discussions with the insurance industry about improving the provision of insurance cover in areas where remedial works are being carried out and OPW is near agreement on a data-sharing platform which will facilitate the transfer of detailed information on completed OPW flood relief schemes on an on-going basis. This will allow the insurance industry to take into account the flood protection measures when assessing flood risk in localities where such flood measures have been completed.</p><p>  While the agreement on the memorandum of understanding with the insurance industry is to be welcomed as a first step, ultimately, it will be a matter for the insurance companies themselves to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence works but they are committing to take the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is to be expected that this will facilitate the provision of flood cover in areas that are protected by completed schemes.</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences based on a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p><p>  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016. Works are completed on a prioritised basis. Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.</p><p>  The Minister for State at OPW has taken the lead role in discussions with the insurance industry about improving the provision of insurance cover in areas where remedial works are being carried out and OPW is near agreement on a data-sharing platform which will facilitate the transfer of detailed information on completed OPW flood relief schemes on an on-going basis. This will allow the insurance industry to take into account the flood protection measures when assessing flood risk in localities where such flood measures have been completed.</p><p>  The Government has previously examined the introduction of a scheme of State indemnification to protect householders who cannot obtain household insurance in respect of flooding from regular insurance bodies. However, at the time this approach was not considered financially viable because it is believed that over time it would distort the market and incentivise industry to discontinue the provision of cover in medium and high risk areas, thus making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive. Furthermore, consultations with the Central Bank have led to concerns that if a levy or charge was applied to households then such a scheme would be considered a State insurance company which would raise a range of regulatory and capital issues. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the response to the recent flooding events, the Department of Finance is currently undertaking a review of the availability of flood insurance cover. When the review is complete, I will examine it and will report to Cabinet on what measures, if any, are needed to improve the availability of flood insurance cover.</p><p>  The Deputy refers to the scheme proposed by the National Flood Forum.  I am aware that the Flood Forum gave a presentation to the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the issue of property insurance in March 2013.  These proposals will be considered as part of the flooding insurance review.</p><p>  The Deputy also refers to a reinsurance scheme whereby insurance companies could pool their flood insurance liabilities, similar to the temporary scheme in the UK known as Flood Re.  However, the introduction of such a scheme would likely lead to a significant increase in household insurance premiums as those in low risk areas would be required to subsidise those in high risk areas.  Furthermore, the Exchequer would also be required to provide financial assistance to such a scheme in circumstances where the claims were above the level of funds in the pool.  I am continuing to monitor how the difficulties around the Flood Re scheme are being addressed in the UK.</p><p>  In cases where individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance believe that they are being treated unfairly, they can contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at .</p></reply>

The best way to effectively address this issue is for countries to work together at the international level and the appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of their project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Ireland is participating fully in this process.</p><p>  The second issue is the effective rate of tax applying in individual countries.  Clearly, the domestic rate of tax paid in Ireland is within the control of the Irish tax system   and Ireland is responsible for the amount of Irish corporation tax that is charged here.  I want to reemphasise that all companies operating in Ireland   domestic businesses and multinationals - are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here. A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land-dealing activities, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.</p><p>  There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax and there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure for this.</p><p>  There are however a range of independent studies that show the effective rate in Ireland as being very close to the main headline rate of 12.5%.  The European Commission's Taxation Trends in the EU 2013 indicates an effective corporation tax rate for Ireland of 14.4% per cent.  The Price Waterhouse Coopers / World Bank 2014 report shows an effective rate of 12.3% for Ireland.  I know that the assumptions being used in that latter study have been challenged and I am not claiming ownership of the figures but they are examples of the way that different methodologies can produce different results.In response to the growing interest in the subject, the Revenue Commissioners now publish an additional explanatory note with their annual Statistical Report.</p><p>  The 2012 Revenue Statistical Report (which refers to 2011 data) indicates that aggregate net taxable profits, after taking account of various deductions, allowances, charges and reliefs, amounted to &euro;40.1 billion while the total amount of corporation tax payable on these profits was &euro;4.2 billion. This means that total corporation tax payable as a percentage of taxable profits was approximately 10.5 per cent for 2011.</p><p>  While this percentage is lower than the 12&frac12; per cent rate, this can be attributed to the availability of certain reliefs such as double taxation relief and the R&amp;amp;D credit for example.</p><p>  The issue of effective rates of corporate tax was discussed at length at Committee Stage of Finance No. 2 Bill 2013 last November.  In view of the significant confusion around the issue, it was agreed that my Department would prepare a report on the matter to be presented to the Oireachtas Finance Committee by the end of Quarter 1 this year.</p><p>  This report is currently being prepared and will likely be published upon completion.</p></reply>

On foot of this Memorandum, a joint Invitation to Make Submissions was published in June 2012, following which a number of proposals for a new marker were received. These submissions were subjected to a rigorous joint evaluation process by Revenue and HMRC that was completed late last year.  As a result of this process, a new product was identified to mark rebated fuels in both countries.  The new marker, which was announced on 13th February, is an important element of Revenue's overall strategy to tackle the problem of fuel laundering.</p><p>  During the joint evaluation of submissions, laboratory testing showed that the chosen marker is significantly more effective than the current markers and is highly resistant to known laundering techniques.</p><p>  The decision on the implementation of the new marker rested with the Board of the Revenue Commissioners and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the UK.  I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that all relevant issues were taken into account in the final decision on the marker.

These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary;</p><p>  - An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations; and</p><p>  - following a joint process, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK have identified a new product to mark rebated fuels in a move that will boost the fight against illegal fuel laundering in both jurisdictions.</p><p>  Revenue also works with fuel sector representative bodies, which have been very supportive of the range of measures introduced to combat fuel laundering, to improve the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud. In support of this, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty evaded. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying fuel recklessly to dubious customers.  Revenue has recently published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group and has established regional sub-groups to facilitate traders reporting suspicious matters through their representative associations on a confidential basis.  This information can assist Revenue in closing down the illicit trade by identifying traders supplying fuel to launderers and by identifying outlets that are selling laundered diesel.  Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results.  In the period from mid-2011 to end January 2014, 123 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.  Since the beginning of 2011, over 2.7 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 9 oil laundries in 2013.</p></reply>

In terms of equity, it is appropriate that those who make capital gains should make a contribution in tax terms so that the entire tax burden does not only significantly fall on those who pay income taxes. Capital gains tax also plays a role in mitigating opportunities for tax avoidance by discouraging the conversion of income into capital gains to reduce tax liability.</p><p>  Reliefs play an important role in relation to most taxes and capital gains tax is no different in this regard. Targeted business related capital gains tax reliefs are provided principally to ensure that business, while paying its share of capital gains tax, is not unduly hampered in terms of developing and growing its business or in passing on businesses to the next generation of business people.</p><p>  The following capital gains tax reliefs are all geared towards assisting business:</p><p>  - Appropriation to and from stock in trade (section 596 Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997)</p><p>  - Entrepreneur relief (section 597A TCA 1997) (subject to a commencement order due to requirement for EU State Aid approval)</p><p>  - Retirement relief (sections 598/599 TCA 1997)</p><p>  - Transfer of business to a company (section 600 TCA 1997)</p><p>  - Replacement of Qualifying Premises ( certain rented residential premises (section 600A, TCA 1997) [now only available in limited circumstances]</p><p>  - Relief for farm restructuring (section 604B TCA 1997</p><p>  - Disposals to authority possessing compulsory powers (section 605 TCA 1997)</p><p>  - Transfer of assets on company reconstructions or amalgamation (section 615 TCA 1997</p><p>  - Reliefs in relation to inter-group company transactions (sections 617 et seq.).</p><p>   All reliefs are reviewed periodically and maintained, adjusted or abolished by reference to the circumstances that exist at the time relative to those that gave rise to their introduction.</p><p>  Take Roll-over relief (Section 597), for example. Roll-over relief was introduced in 1975 when capital gains tax was first enacted. It allowed chargeable gains on disposals of business assets to be deferred provided the proceeds of disposal were reinvested in new business assets.  This relief was reviewed and was removed in Finance Act 2003 from 4 December 2002 onwards, except in the case of eligible taxpayers who had rolled-over assets prior to that date. The abolition of rollover relief in late 2002 must be seen in the context of the introduction at that time of the single 12.5% rate of corporation tax on trading profits.</p><p>  Another example of a business relief that was reviewed and amended is the capital gains tax farm retirement relief which was amended in Finance (No 2) Act 2013. This was extended to allow relief to a farmer who farmed for 10 years, has no children to whom to pass on the land, and who lets the farm for a period following retirement from active farming before ultimately disposing of the land. Prior to this such a farmer would not have been entitled to retirement relief.</p><p>  Certain reliefs are introduced from time to time with a view to achieving a particular objective in particular circumstances.</p><p>  Examples of such reliefs include:</p><p>  - Relief for certain disposals of land and buildings (section 604A TCA 1997 - introduced by section 64, Finance Act 2012). This short-term relief was introduced to provide a stimulus to the property market at a time when there was virtually no activity in it. The intention being that the impact would be both direct (on estate agents, surveyors, etc) and indirect (on construction related activities) as well as encouraging the sale of commercial premises and long term investment in productive assets, thereby assisting in the creation of longer term employment. This is a targeted relief   it only applies to certain land and buildings acquired during the period 7 December 2011 to 31 December 2014. Any such property acquired must be held for 7 years in order to qualify for full relief. Any disposal within the 7 year period gets no relief.</p><p>  - Relief for farm restructuring (section 604B TCA 1997 introduced by section 48, Finance Act 2013). This relief was identified as desirable to assist farmers to become more viable by enabling them to restructure their land holdings without incurring a capital gains tax.  This relief is a more focused form of relief than the more general roll-over relief that was in the main abolished from 4 December 2002.</p><p>  - Entrepreneur relief (section 597A TCA 1997 introduced by section 45 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013). This is a CGT relief for individuals who reinvest the proceeds of previous asset disposals into new business ventures. The commencement of this relief is subject to EU State Aid approval.Lastly, I announced in my Budget 2014 speech, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that I would commission a review of tax reliefs available to farming. This review will include CGT reliefs available to farming. Any recommendations of the review will be considered in the context of Budget 2015.</p></reply>

I have however, introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015. </p><p>  The impact of the Jobs Initiative can be seen by the increase in employment levels, particularly in the accommodation and food services sector. The Jobs Initiative included the reduction of VAT on tourism services to 9% from 13.5% on a temporary basis until the end of 2013. This measure has proved to be a major success, helping create over 15,000 new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. It was due to end in 2013. However, it is important that we reinforce success when possible, so I have decided to continue this reduced rate. This will support the increased number of jobs already in place and accelerate the creation of new jobs.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced the reduction of the Air Travel Tax to zero with effect from 1st April 2014. The decision to remove the tax, together with the retention of the 9% VAT rate for tourism services, will help maintain the momentum created by the success of The Gathering this year. Since the Budget announcement, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in a significant increase in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.</p><p>  The Jobs Initiative also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures, including a number aimed at retraining the workforce. I would ask the Deputy to note that my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D., with responsibility for JobBridge, the National Internship scheme, recently announced that the number of internships, originally planned at 5,000 has now exceeded 20,000. Indecon Economic Consultants undertook an evaluation of the JobBridge scheme in 2012 (published in April 2013) and their report found that 61.4% of the JobBridge survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships.</p><p>  Under education measures, the Springboard scheme as announced in the Jobs Initiative had initially provided for 5,900 places. During 2011 and 2012, over 10,000 people enrolled on programmes under the Springboard scheme. The scheme has been extended further with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn T.D. announcing in June this year, another 6,000 places under the third Springboard allocation. Further rollouts of the springboard scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of an on-going evaluation. </p><p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. I cannot intervene in this process in respect of any pension fund.</p><p>  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. </p><p>  Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the difficulties in the labour market remains the Government's biggest challenge and, accordingly, the Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.</p></reply>

Sections 151 and 153 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) enable the Revenue Commissioners to request certain details from specified bodies for LPT purposes. Section 153 of the Act includes a list of these bodies. </p><p>  Under section 151 of the Act, the information that the Revenue Commissioners may request is details, in the possession or control of the relevant person, of the address or addresses, as the case may be, of residential properties, and in relation to each residential property:</p><p>  - the name of the occupier,</p><p>  - the name of the owner,</p><p>  - the address contained in any geodirectory maintained by any relevant person or such other information as may allow the location of the property to be established,</p><p>  - any unique identification number which the relevant person has assigned to the property or, as the case may be, to any meter or other device located in the property or to the occupier or owner of that property, and</p><p>  - information in relation to the size and type of the property. </p><p>  As there is a legislative basis for the sharing of the specified information by these bodies with the Revenue Commissioners, it is permitted from a data protection perspective under section 8(e) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  However, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is routinely consulted in relation to proposed data exchanges between State Bodies and Revenue and did provide guidance in relation to aspects of the data which was transferred to Revenue for the purposes of implementing Local Property Tax.   A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue in the implementation of LPT was the development of a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State. The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own databases, the Household Charge database from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), Non-Principal Private Residence data, Private Residential Tenancies Board data, information from the Department of Social Protection and data from utility companies.  As well as being provided for in the LPT legislation, in advance of the data exchanges, data protocol agreements were drawn up between Revenue and the relevant organisations. These outlined how the data would be transmitted and how it would be secured and managed by Revenue.  I am also advised that the Commissioners utilised the following data sources in their development of the on-line interactive valuation guide, most of which are publically available:</p><p>  - Revenue's stamp duty records, which record all property sales in the Republic and the values of the properties sold.</p><p>  - CSO's Residential Property Price Index which provides guidance on establishing the percentage reduction to be applied to the prices obtained for properties sold in 2010, 2011 or 2012.</p><p>  - The Geo-Directory produced by Ordnance Survey Ireland and An Post, which provides information on property location and type.</p><p>  - Information in relation to property location and type collected by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</p><p>  - Spatially derived data that indicate relative distances of all residential properties (using GeoDirectory) to a series of key amenities and services (transport, health, education, retail, emergency services etc).</p><p>  - Geographically linked data from publicly available sources such as the Central Statistic Office Census 2011 results at small area level and the 2012 Pobal HP Deprivation index. </p><p>   Revenue is an integrated tax and customs organisation. Frontline customer service, compliance and debt management staff throughout the organisation, amounting to about 4,800 at clerical, administrative and management grades, who are authorised to do so, have access to taxpayer records, including LPT, to enable them to do their jobs.   I am advised that access to data by Revenue staff is based on a management approved business case. Access controls are in place for staff using all Revenue taxpayer systems.  All access is recorded and regular audits are carried out to ensure access policies are followed. The Deputy should note that this number fluctuates as a result of staff movements and changing business needs.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that taxpayer confidence in Revenue is essential for the organisation to fulfil its duties as laid down by the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is Revenue's reputation for properly and securely holding and using data that has nurtured and sustained that confidence.  This principle of taxpayer confidentiality has always been central to the ethos of the organisation. The Finance Act 2011 introduced a taxpayer confidentiality provision which reinforced the existing ethos by providing the clear legal basis which allows Revenue officials to disclose taxpayer information and includes legal sanctions where this provision is breached. It has been hugely influential in encouraging staff to be more vigilant, thus further strengthening data protection in the organisation. </p><p>  The security and privacy of Revenue taxpayer data are of the highest priority and Revenue implements a host of different procedures and policies to protect this data.  Revenue has a number of policies and practices in place to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of taxpayer data.</p><p> - Revenue has a Data Controller appointed by the Board pursuant to Section 1 of the Data Protection Acts who has overall responsibility for driving data protection policy and management.</p><p>  - A code of practice for the protection of personal data in Revenue was introduced in January of 2013 which was developed in conjunction with the office of the Data Protection Commissioner and is designed to give operational meaning to the principles of data protection set out in the Data Protection Acts.</p><p>  - Following on the Code of Practice, a consolidated Data Breach Management Plan has also been introduced which places the responsibility on senior management to report breaches to the Data Controller and which are logged in a data breach register which the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner may access. </p><p>  Data protection policies and practices in Revenue have been examined on a number of occasions by the Data Protection Commissioner. His report of the substantial cross-organisation audit in 2010 was positive and Revenue has subsequently built on some of the recommendations in that report.All Revenue officials are bound by the Officials Secrets Acts, the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, the Revenue Code of Ethics, in addition to Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, which introduced criminal sanctions for unauthorised disclosure of taxpayer information. Revenue has a range of internal controls to ensure compliance. Internal data protection audits were introduced in 2010 which examine compliance with the Data Protection Acts in district and regional offices. New measures were introduced to assure staff compliance with Revenue policy on data security and confidentiality. This facilitates periodic review of staff access logs to ensure compliance with access and transaction processing rules.Revenue has attained and maintained ISO27001 since January 2010 accreditation.  This covers information/data security for the public facing systems (www.revenue.ie and www.ros.ie).  ISO27001 is the international best practice standard for information security and is independently audited by external practitioners.  For Revenue this includes all live application software, network, security, server, operating systems, middleware, data, storage and the monitoring components within these zones.  Revenue systems/processes were last audited in November 2013.  Revenue also holds ISO 22301 for their Data Centres, which is the international standard for business continuity management. The ISO 22301 management system lets you identify threats relevant to your business and the critical business functions they could impact. It requires Revenue to have plans in place ahead of time to ensure business continuity.Finally, I am advised that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is routinely consulted in relation to all proposed data exchanges between State Bodies and Revenue.  </p></reply>

The CCMA is a statutory Code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law.</p><p>  As statutory regulatory of credit institutions, the Central Bank has the power, from both a prudential and consumer protection perspective, to require banks to meaningfully address mortgage arrears cases on their books.  Durable long term restructures will have to be applied having regard to the circumstances of individual cases.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) announced last March set time bound and measurable targets for the six main banks requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  On the basis of their audit of the bank's mortgage arrears targets, the Central Bank has indicated that all six mortgage lenders covered by the MART process have reported that they met the 20% proposed sustainable solutions target for the second quarter of 2013 and also the 30% target for the third quarter in 2013.  Under this rolling process, quarterly performance targets have now been set to the end of June 2014 to require the banks to propose and put in place durable long term solutions to address individual cases of mortgage arrears of more than 90 days in arrears.  The subsequent targets set by the Central Bank will be the subject of further audit work to ensure consistency with the sustainability principle in respect of solutions being offered by the lenders.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Deputy may also wish to note, that according to information collected by my Department for the 6 main lenders, in the case of private dwelling homes some 51,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of permanent restructuring following engagement between borrower and lender.  A further 21,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of temporary restructures.  The data published by my Department and the Central Bank would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in early arrears and putting in place appropriate measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.</p><p>  Taken together, the necessary framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.  However, early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.  However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this throughout 2014.</p></reply>

The resumption of economic growth reflects the improvement in our competitiveness that we have seen in recent years and is indicative of a very flexible economy.  But we are also seeing a moderate recovery in domestic demand, suggesting that some of the imbalances built up during the bubble years are being corrected.</p><p>  My Department estimates that GDP rose by 0.2 per cent last year; this compares with an average decline of 0.4 per cent across the euro area. However, developments in euro area trading partners have been relatively encouraging since the middle of last year, with the euro area returning to growth after several quarters of contraction.</p><p>  I am particularly encouraged by recent developments in our labour market. The unemployment rate, although still unacceptably high, has declined by nearly 3 percentage points in under two years to 12.3 per cent in January. Supporting this reduction in the unemployment rate has been a resumption of strong employment growth, with employment increasing by 3.2 per cent (58,000 jobs) over the year to the third quarter of last year, the highest year-on-year rate of growth in the entire EU according to Eurostat figures.</p><p>  Although developments in Ireland of late have been encouraging, it is of course worth noting that we do not move in isolation. A recovery in our European partners is vital if we are to continue the recent positive momentum we have seen in Ireland and achieve sustained growth over the medium term.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the Agency to decide when and how much to borrow in the light of those needs, commercial considerations surrounding the raising of debt on the markets and the need to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity.  All monies raised through Government borrowing are paid into the Central Fund and used to fund Government spending as approved by the Oireachtas. It has never been the custom to  link borrowing to specific projects as to do so would limit the flexibility of the Government in managing the State's finances.</p><p>  There are a number of options available to individuals who wish to help support the Government's work in promoting economic growth and employment.  The National Solidarity Bonds were introduced to provide a wider range of options for retail investors. The Minister for Finance in announcing Budget 2010 launched the 10-year National Solidarity Bond, the purpose of which was to allow citizens an opportunity to invest and provide money to the State to stimulate economic recovery and to assist in the maintenance and creation of employment. Following the success of the launch of the ten-year National Solidarity Bond a four-year National Solidarity Bond was launched in 2011.</p><p>  The NTMA's other State Savings products, available through any Post Office, allow people to support the Exchequer through Savings Bonds, Savings Certificates and Instalment Savings.  There are also possibilities in place for people interested in investing in longer-term Government bonds. Irish sovereign bonds are available through seventeen Primary Dealers recognised by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). The NTMA has published information on their website () which gives the names and contact details for institutions which sell bonds to the public, and the fees they charge.</p></reply>

These figures show that in 2012, Ireland's GDP per capita adjusted for Purchasing Power Standards was &euro;33,200, the fifth highest in Europe and third highest in the euro area, behind only Luxembourg and Austria. The level in Ireland compares to an average of &euro;25,500 across the EU28 and of &euro;27,500 across the euro area's then-17 Member States; comparable data on the euro area 18 are not yet available.</p><p>  However, in the Irish case (as with some other Member States) the presence of a large number of foreign-owned multinationals can impact considerably on the level of GDP. The gap between GDP and gross national income (GNI) which strips out the net income generated from economic activity in Ireland but which is repatriated abroad is relatively large in Ireland (GNI also nets out transfers and subidies from the EU). European Commission data suggest that GNI per capita (in current prices and unadjusted for price differentials between countries) in Ireland was the 8th highest of the 18 euro area Member States in 2012 and 14 per cent above the EU average.</p></reply>

While it is disappointing that ACC and Danske Bank have taken this decision, it is noted that one of the key features of banking strategy in the financial crisis has been the retrenchment to national borders.</p><p>  ACC Bank is a subsidiary of the Rabobank Group based in the Netherlands which has taken the commercial decision, as a private enterprise, to return ACC's banking licence to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank does not envisage that this will occur until the second half of 2014.</p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that, since Danske Bank's original announcement of its commercial decision to withdraw existing day to day personal customer products and services on a phased basis during the first half of 2014, and also to discontinue the provision of personal and business banking products to new customers, the Central Bank has been in communication with Danske Bank. Under the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code, banks are required to give a minimum of 2 months' notice before they close a consumer's account. It is important that consumers are given adequate notice to allow them to take the required steps to close or transfer their accounts. Danske has confirmed that it provided this required notice in December last for those accounts closing in February and also that it issued reminder letters. </p><p>  I wish to highlight that all banks providing current accounts in Ireland are subject to the Central Bank's Current Account Switching Code, which is designed to make the process of switching current accounts easier and quicker and to offer protection and support for consumers when switching bank account.  The Switching Code places obligations and time limits on both the old and the new bank when completing the switching process.  Where accounts include credit facilities, such credit facilities will be subject to the credit assessment process applicable at the receiving bank.</p><p>  Customers with any concerns or questions about their accounts are advised to contact Danske Bank on telephone 1890 866 866 for Personal Banking and 1890 866 860 for Business Banking.  Other information is available on Danske Bank's website .  If customers have made a complaint to Danske Bank and are not satisfied with the outcome, they have the right to refer the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p></reply>

These include:</p><p>- Work with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance to develop an initiative that will improve funding mechanisms for SMEs. </p><p>- Detailed data from AIB and Bank of Ireland will be collated and examined, on a monthly basis ensuring a more informed understanding of the SME bank lending environment, with a particular focus on new lending.                                        </p><p>- The SME State Bodies Group will be rolling out a comprehensive communications strategy to ensure that SMEs are aware of the State supports for which they may be eligible.</p><p>  In addition to my meetings with various business representative organisations in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill process, the SME Funding Consultation Committee, chaired by my Department, provides a forum for consultation with stakeholders around Government policy regarding the provision of credit to SMEs. In addition, officials from my Department, along with the Credit Review Office, recently met with representatives from Chambers Ireland, ISME and SFA to discuss issues pertaining to credit availability affecting their members. These meetings take place on a regular basis and inform the workings of the SME State Bodies Group.</p></reply>

Section 149 came into effect in 1996 and currently requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make an  application to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce a new customer charge or increase any existing customer charge in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not apply to interest rates; it applies to fees, charges  and commissions only. </p><p>My Department recently published a review of the regulation of bank fees and charges which is available on the website    . The review concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal Section 149 at this time. The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the repeal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.  The report recommends that this issue should be revisited when competition in the banking sector has improved significantly.  It is my view that the current regulatory regime offers appropriate protection to consumers against unjustified increases in bank fees and commissions. </p></reply>

It also recognises that businesses with legacy debts may be viable. One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.  As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Credit Bureau is a private entity and I have no direct function in the day-to-day operational decisions. In relation to the credit ratings provided to SMEs my Department recognised the need to reorganise the Government reporting system and established an inter-agency working group at the end of 2010 to develop a strategy to put in place an effective credit reporting system in Ireland.  The working group's report formed the basis of the Credit Reporting Act 2013.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Credit Reporting Act 2013 provides for the creation of an effective statutory based credit reporting system.  The Bill includes the following provisions:</p><p>  - The database will be owned by the Central Bank and the Bank will be responsible for the operation of the Central Credit Register. </p><p>  - There will be mandatory reporting of a comprehensive range of credit information by credit providers. </p><p>  - The Bill provides for controls with regard to access to information on the Register. By including provisions relating to access to data and security measures as well as provisions to help to deal with identity theft, this legislation should inspire confidence in businesses and in the consumer.</p><p>  - The legislation proposes to extend the role of the Data Protection Commissioner to deal with complaints from micro enterprises and SMEs (with a turnover of less than &euro;3m) in respect of their data held on the Credit Register. This initiative may provide some comfort to enterprises where they have a concern in relation to the potential storing of inaccurate data and where they do not have the resources to take legal action through the Courts to seek to have the data corrected. Inaccurate data on the Central Credit Register could result in the refusal of credit to a small company.  </p><p>  - In line with International practice, it provides for a retention period of 5 years in relation to credit information with respect to debts from the day on which it is entered on the Register. The Bill provides for the retention of information for a period of 6 months in relation to credit applications from the day it is entered on the Register. Anonymised information may be retained indefinitely.In addition, the Government is fully engaged in supporting the SME sector and has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved the targets for 2011 and 2012.  I am informed that both banks sanctioned circa &euro;4bn in lending in 2013.In June 2013 the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term solutions.  The targets set reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.  I should stress that the Credit Review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by AIB or Bank of Ireland as well as when credit is refused by them. I would strongly advise any SME whose credit is reduced or withdrawn to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.</p></reply>

Of this amount, &euro;242m was in respect of LPT for 2013 and &euro;76m relates to 2014 LPT.

However, it also stated that there is a sizeable deadweight element to this relief as many individuals would pay these premiums in the absence of the income tax relief. On that basis, the Commission recommended that the relief should be continued but on a more limited basis. As a result of this recommendation, I introduced a restriction in terms of the amount of medical insurance premiums that qualifies for tax relief in Budget 2014. The introduction of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief is intended to ensure a continuing incentive via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.</p></reply>

The main impact of the introduction of the exemption would have been in the commercial property area, including buy-to-lets.  Concerns have been expressed about the residential property market in Dublin.  However, these concerns relate largely to issues of supply of certain types of property in the city.  I am not aware of any indications that the CGT exemption measure is an issue in this regard.  Furthermore, such supply side pressures do not appear to be a feature of the property market nationally. </p><p>  I have no intentions of stoking another property bubble and this is reflected in the fact that the CGT exemption measure is time-bound and of relatively short duration.

There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot;  Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. </p><p>  As the single supervisory mechanism is not expected to be in place and operational until later this year, the  ESM's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument cannot take effect until then.

I have however, introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative.  The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015. </p><p>  The chargeable persons for the pension fund levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. </p><p>  There are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999).</p><p>  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is, or was, wholly exercised outside the State.  In other words, the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits outside the State. </p><p>  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.</p><p>  The fact that there are very limited situations where the levy does not have to be paid explains, in part at least, why it was possible to introduce it at a relatively low rate of 0.6% in the first place and to keep the rate of the additional levy as low as 0.15%.  Making exceptions in the circumstances outlined in the question, will inevitably give rise to demands for exceptions to be granted in other situations that would be viewed by those seeking them as being equally deserving.  The inevitable result of this course of action would be a narrowing of the levy base which would result in a greater imposition on the non-exempt schemes and I am not prepared to go down that road.</p></reply>

In recent months a significant proportion of payments generated in Ireland have moved to the two SEPA schemes, SEPA Credit Transfer  and SEPA Direct Debit.  It is anticipated that all payments will be processed in SEPA by 31 March 2014, well in advance of the transitional deadline of 1 August 2014, allowed by the European Commission. </p><p>   As we transition between our domestic payments system and SEPA, delays on when payments are shown as having been received in bank accounts have been experienced by a small percentage of account holders.   These  relate to an intra-day delay in payment processing and do not have value implications for customers.  The Central Bank has informed me that it is working closely with the Irish Payment Services Organisation  and the individual banks to have any known issues rectified in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the impact of SEPA on the end January Exchequer returns. This problem related to the longer notice period required for SEPA Direct Debits.  The end January Exchequer figures were down in year-on-year terms.  However, this was a technical timing issue and will not alter the tax forecast for the year.  I understand that these notice periods are expected to reduce as SEPA is reviewed over the coming years.</p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the section 8 exemption applies to a clearly defined group of property owners, who are being identified using Stamp Duty records.

Step-by-step instructions on how to claim the exemption online are available on the Commissioner's website at the following link .  Where a claim for exemption under Section 8 has been received by Revenue and found to be in order, Revenue has confirmed that if the property owner had completed a Single Debit Authority (SDA) dated 21 March 2014 that the SDA will not be activated by Revenue where Revenue is notified no later than 10 March.  </p><p>  For those property owners who do not manage to claim the exemption before 10 March and had completed the SDA, when they subsequently claim the exemption the overpaid LPT will be refunded.Revenue has advised that the number of property owners who qualify for the exemption under section 8 and who also completed the SDA will not be available until the claims for exemption are finalised.</p></reply>

Section 149 came into effect in 1996 and currently requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make an application to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce a new customer charge or increase any existing customer charge in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not apply to interest rates; it applies to fees, charges and commissions only. </p><p>My Department recently published a review of the regulation of bank fees and charges which is available on the website . </p><p>  The review found that:</p><p>  - net fee and commission income divided by average assets in Irish banks was well below the average of their peers; and</p><p>  - net fee and commission are lower in the Irish banks than in their European peers relative to net interest income.</p><p>  The review concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal Section 149 at this time. The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the repeal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.  The report recommends that this issue should be revisited when competition in the banking sector has improved significantly.  </p><p>  In addition to the above, I can confirm for the Deputy that I have also recieved the following feedback from AIB and BoI in relation to the cost of banking for customers in the the Republic of Ireland versus Northern Ireland:</p><p>  Allied Irish Banks:</p><p>  &quot;The Central Bank of Ireland published research in 2011 which compared personal current account charges applied by banks in the Republic of Ireland with those applied by a selection of banks in the UK and Northern Ireland.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p><p>This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p><p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about his educational progress I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist</p></reply>

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme. </p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years and I am aware of the difficulties faced by schools in relation to these schemes.  Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.</p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.</p><p>Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools. Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim. </p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.  The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.</p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental/loan scheme and will not therefore qualify for funding.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by this Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects. The Government has provided &euro;37 million for the scheme in 2014 which will benefit over 205,000 children across some 1,600 schools and organisations.</p><p>  In recent years priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills initiative for disadvantaged schools &ldquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rdquo;(DEIS). </p><p>  Existing schools participating in the scheme who have established their food clubs providing support to the children therein continue to receive funding under the scheme. These schools were eligible to join the school meals programme as they were, at the time of application, designated educationally disadvantaged under one of the various Department of Education and Skills initiatives in place at that time. Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme. Policy for educational initiatives and criteria for determining educational disadvantage is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills other than the School Completion Programme which is the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  </p><p>  For a period of approximately 2 years after the introduction of DEIS, schools which were part of the educational initiatives as outlined above were permitted to join the school meals programme in respect of children whose families were in receipt of social welfare payments, medical cards or experiencing hardship or difficulties due to particular events or circumstances. In addition, a small number of schools, including special schools providing education to children with disabilities, have been admitted to the school meals scheme since 2005.  </p></reply>

This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  T&uacute;s is designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market.</p><p>  The duration of the T&uacute;s contract was set to reflect a number of inter-related elements.  These include (i) the need to ensure that limited numbers of placements available are opened to those on the Live Register, (ii) that weaknesses identified in other work programmes resulting from longer duration placements are not replicated with T&uacute;s, (iii) optimisation of the resources available and (iv) how T&uacute;s fits with the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s activation policies in Pathways to Work.  </p><p>  I consider the existing 12-month period on T&uacute;s to be adequate to meet the programme&rsquo;s objectives.  It also ensures that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the initiative. There are no circumstances under which a person&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s will be extended beyond 12 months.  Opportunities are available on community employment where a person is interested in pursuing a work placement that may have a longer duration in order to completed certified training.  Time spend on T&uacute;s is considered eligible for accessing community employment.  As of the week ending 10th January 2014, 7,121 participants were working and in receipt of a payment on T&uacute;s.

JobPath will be delivered by private/third party providers of employment services under contract to the Department.  JobPath will augment and complement the Department&rsquo;s existing employment service capacity as well as that of the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs, which already operate under contract to the Department, thereby increasing capacity to provide supports to assist jobseekers in obtaining employment. The contracting approach offers the State a number of advantages not least of which are that contractors will have to bear the initial investment costs of the new service and contracting is flexible in responding to changes in service needs. </p><p>  On 1 July 2013, the Department published a Prior Information Notice (PIN) in which it notified the market that it was considering the potential of contracting private/third party providers of employment services. A PIN is a discretionary and exploratory first step in a procurement process.  A consultation process was initiated whereby the Department held two information sessions in late July 2013 at which it outlined its thinking in relation to JobPath and invited responses. These events were attended by over 200 individuals representing a wide range of organisations involved in labour market activation including LES representatives. The Department also set up a dedicated email address to facilitate questions and feedback. A full list of the attendees and a question and answer document were published on the Department&rsquo;s website (). On 7 November 2013, Enterprise Ireland hosted a capacity building and networking event for interested parties of JobPath. This event was also attended by LES representatives.</p><p>  On 12 December 2013, the Department published a contract notice inviting tenders for the provision of JobPath services. The closing date for receipt of JobPath tenders is 28 February 2014. Tender documentation has been published on   while information on JobPath is available on   . LES providers are free to participate in the JobPath procurement process. </p><p>  The cost of the JobPath service is dependent upon the price agreed following the tendering process. JobPath is a payment by results model and as such the cost of JobPath is also dependent upon the number of individuals that JobPath providers place into sustained employment.</p><p>  JobPath contractors have not yet been appointed. It is not necessarily the case that contracts will be exclusively with large private companies. Many of the larger companies involved in this activity in other states are not-for-profit and/or voluntary/community companies.  The level of sub-contracting that may be involved in the delivery of JobPath will not become clear until the tender evaluation process has been completed.  </p></reply>

These processing times improved in 2013 to 27.6 weeks for a summary decision and 34.4 weeks for an oral hearing.</p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009 the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum, whereas in 2012 the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.</p><p>  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hands from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 14,510 at 17 February 2014.</p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystallises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p><p><b>Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals 2012 and 2013</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Appeals Registered</th><th>Appeals Allowed</th><th>Appeals Partially Allowed</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2,186</td><td>874</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1,688</td><td>783</td><td>25</td></tr></table></p></reply>

For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.   </p><p>  Further, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments, including the previously self-employed, may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.  </p><p>  The Work Placement Programme is also open to persons not in receipt of a social welfare payment, although the participant will not receive a payment while on the programme.</p><p>  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p></reply>

Consistent with this role the system, most notably via jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes supports to part-time work under the family income supplement scheme, the system also helps persons to attain and maintain a foothold in the labour market, subject to income tests and other criteria.</p><p>  Supports of this nature help to ensure that people are better off in work and help them to build a more secure future for their families but are delivered at a considerable cost to the Exchequer.</p><p>  In the context of current fiscal pressures and the urgent need to help more people back to work, I have advocated further debate on the potential role of a living wage as part of the suite of measures designed to support persons with low work income. Conceptually a living wage would be higher than the national minimum wage and would provide the income necessary to meet basic needs without the need for substantial recourse to the welfare system. </p><p>  The statutory responsibility in relation to the terms and conditions of employment are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

(Section 338 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended) refers).  They have received monies to which they were not entitled and every effort will be made to recover the amounts due through all available means.</p><p>  Debt holders should be aware that a debt to the Department will remain on their records until fully recovered and will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension.  Following the death of a customer who owes a debt, the Department will have a claim on any estate remaining.  Currently my Department does not apply interest or penalties on the amounts owing.</p><p>  Overpayments may be recovered by:</p><p>  - payment of a lump sum;</p><p>  - regular payments by the person to the Department;</p><p>  - withholding arrears due to the person;</p><p>  - deduction from ongoing social welfare payments due to the person;</p><p>  - recovery from the person&rsquo;s estate </p><p>  The acceptable method and rate at which a debt is recovered differs from case to case.  In the first instance, where there is evidence of sufficient funds available to repay the debt, the Department seeks to recover the debt in full.  If a person who owes a debt to the Department offers to make a one off payment of a sum less than the total amount owed, the payment will be accepted, however, the outstanding balance will remain on the debt holder&rsquo;s record to be recovered from future entitlement or the estate of the debtor.  In general a debt is not written off while the debt holder is still alive.</p><p>  The Social Welfare Act 2012 provides for recovery levels of up to 15% from the personal rate of a person&rsquo;s social welfare payment without their consent.  This amendment means that the Department is now in a position to ensure that all debt-holders in receipt of a payment from the Department, are repaying their debt.</p><p>  In order to improve the capacity to recover overpayments from persons no longer dependent on social welfare, the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 provides for the introduction of Notice of Attachment powers for the recovery of overpayments directly from a person&rsquo;s earnings or from monies held by them in financial institutions.  The Department will only contemplate using these powers in cases where a person who owes a debt to the Department does not make a genuine attempt to discharge their debt and continues to ignore their obligations to repay what is due.  Recourse to civil action to recover debts will also be undertaken where appropriate.</p></reply>

Following on the loss of the expedition ship <i>Endurance</i>, trapped in the ice from January 1915 until finally crushed in November 1915, the 800 mile journey of Shackleton, Worsley, Crean, Vincent, McCarthy and McNish from Elephant Island to South Georgia in April 1916 is renowned as a truly heroic achievement.  Across the years, it testifies to the fortitude of the group and their amazing resilience, seamanship and survival skills.</p><p>  I am pleased to note the several projects being prepared in Ireland and abroad to mark the centenary of this historic expedition.  Against the background of the World War and the Irish revolution, it offers an insight into a bygone age.  Keeping tightly to the historic timeline, this expedition - from outset to conclusion - will feature in the continuing narrative of centenary times being prepared in the commemorative programme.</p><p>  While there is no funding available at this time to support the production described in the Deputy's Question, I would be grateful to be kept informed of progress with the project.</p></reply>

There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland.  These seven waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.  The proposed bye-laws are intended to support the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals.  That investment has made the waterways more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users.  Given that background, it is now necessary to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing use of the waterways are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users. </p><p>  The proposed new bye-laws provide for the management of house boats, defined as a boat on the canals which is being used as the sole or principal residence of the owner or an occupant with the owner's permission, as well as for extended moorings and residential moorings.  An Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit will be required for a houseboat not navigating or continuously cruising the canals.  The permit will allow the use of a mooring identified by Waterways Ireland on the canals where the houseboat may moor for more than five days and up to one year.  It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the total number of boat owners who will be required to take out an Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit in the event of the draft bye-laws coming into force.  However, I am advised that Waterways Ireland issued 276 Combined Mooring and Passage permits in 2013 for boats to navigate on the Grand and Royal Canals.  In addition, 151 Extended Mooring Permits have been issued to boat owners wishing to occupy dedicated berths on these navigations. </p><p>  The proposed bye-laws will also modernise the charging regime. There will also be further provision for the care, management, maintenance and control and the regulation of the use of the canals, moorings on the canals, and their use by the public for recreation and navigation purposes.</p><p>  I am aware of and appreciate that concerns have been raised regarding the proposed byelaws.  Waterways Ireland undertook a public consultation on the draft bye-laws referred to, which concluded on the 3rd February last.  I am advised that Waterways Ireland is currently in the process of carrying out an analysis of all submissions on the draft bye-laws received during the consultation process.  Once the analysis has been completed, all submissions will be given due consideration by Waterways Ireland and a report on the outcome of the process will be prepared.

To that end, I have asked the Internet Content Governance Advisory (ICGA) Group which I formed in December, to evaluate the full range of content issues that now arise online.  The Group will report in May and Government will consider that report in great detail at that stage.  A public consultation is now open, and submissions from all interested parties are welcome.  I am aware also that the Group expect to meet with all key stakeholders as part of their work in the coming weeks.</p><p>  Our most immediate and important task now is to help educate children, young people and parents as to the risks that can be found online, to support parents and teachers in explaining these issues to children and to identify the optimal technical solution to protect children.  In this regard, there are a range of tools available online to assist parents in managing internet access.  The ISPs themselves have a variety of measures and resources already in place, with software and other tools available to help parents ensure online safety for their children. </p><p>  The issues here are complex and delicate; a balance has to be struck between preserving freedom of speech and freedom of expression online, and protecting children and young people in particular from content that may well be age inappropriate or harmful.  Social media and online content in general are not subject to the same types of editorial restrictions as broadcast media, for example, and questions as to the most appropriate governance model are being asked by governments and civil society groups around the world.  There are no simple answers to these questions but I am confident that the ICGA Group will evaluate all of these issues thoroughly and in detail, and I look forward to their report and recommendations with great interest.</p></reply>

The objective of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism is to have arrangements in place to co-ordinate the provision by Member States of mutual aid to another Member State or Third Country in the event of an emergency which has overwhelmed that State&rsquo;s own response capacity.  The function of the ERCC is to liaise with the affected country which requests assistance , to co-ordinate the dispatch of assistance from other Member States and to share any relevant information.  The Mechanism operates under the principle of subsidiarity and can only be initiated with a formal request for assistance from an affected Member State. In view of the fact that our national response resources were not overwhelmed during the period of severe weather, and the response was effectively managed at local level, no request was made to the ERCC for assistance.  I understand that under a mutual agreement, UK and Northern Ireland electricity have been assisting the ESB with power restoration since 17 February.   </p></reply>

The purpose of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) is to allow Member States to request financial aid in the event of major natural disasters.  There is a damage threshold per Member State which is set at 0.6% of GNI.  The estimated costs of damage caused by the storms between 13 December 2013 and 6 January 2014 of &euro;61.472 m, plus other costs estimated at &euro;10 m, are well below the non-negotiable GNI threshold of 0.6% (&euro;770m in the case of Ireland) of the Solidarity Fund.  Assistance from the Fund is limited to financing emergency operations undertaken by the public authorities alleviating non-insurable damages.  The possibility of a regional application has also been considered.  This is also subject to a series of impact criteria, (including 50% of population of an affected region) which this situation does not appear to meet.</p></reply>

Where a person ceases to be a member before age 50, whether voluntarily or as a result of failure to be re-elected, the gratuity will be paid when the person reaches age 50 and will be based on the representational payment applicable at that point.  The Local Authority Members (Gratuity) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 provide for the gratuity to be paid before age 50 where retirement is due to permanent infirmity or where the member dies in office.  The amount of the gratuity is calculated on the basis of 4/20ths of a Councillor&rsquo;s Representational Payment for each year of service from 4 May 2000, subject to a maximum twenty years&rsquo; service (i.e. four times the amount of the Representational Payment at the time of retirement).</p><p>  An additional ex-gratia payment may be made to Councillors serving on or after the date of the making of the 2006 Regulations in respect of service before 4 May 2000.  The rates to be applied are dependent on the number of years&rsquo; service and the category of local authority in which the Councillor served.  Circular Letter S.3/2007 of 22 January 2007, issued by my Department, set the rate of payment of the ex-gratia payment at &euro;714.23 for each year of service up to 20 years&rsquo; service with a County Council or what was at the time a County Borough Corporation, at &frac12; this rate for service with what was at the time a Borough Corporation or an Urban District Council, and at &frac14; this rate for service as a Town Commissioner.  For service in excess of 20 years prior to 4 May 2000, the foregoing rates are reduced by 1/3rd for each additional year of service up to a further 20 years.  However, where a person was a member of more than one local authority (e.g. a county council and an urban district council), at the one time, only one of those periods may be reckoned in calculating the ex-gratia payment and that will be in respect of the membership which is most favourable.</p><p>  There is an overall limit of 40 years&rsquo; service for the gratuity and ex-gratia payment combined, with the service reckoned for the purposes of a gratuity calculated first and the residual number of years being used to calculate any ex-gratia payment.  Where an outgoing councillor seeks election to a County Council and is successful, service as a county or town councillor is held on record for calculating the gratuity when that elected member retires or fails to be re-elected at a later stage.  Where an outgoing councillor, including a town councillor, seeks but is not successful in being elected to a county or city or city and county council, a gratuity will be payable in accordance with the arrangements set out above.</p></reply>

That is why the Government, in its housing policy statement published in 2011, presented a new approach to the provision of social housing.  The financial parameters in which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return by local authorities to very large capital funded construction programmes of the kind requiring extensive land.</p><p>   The priority in terms of supports provided by Government must be on meeting the most acute needs, responding through a variety of mechanisms, and using more flexible funding models.  To maximise the social housing gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accomodation Scheme each play their part as long term social housing supports.  Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies in terms of acquisitions and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease.  Through these and other approaches, I expect that in the region of 5,000 social housing units will be provided this year.  I am committed to continuing to develop innovative and sustainable approaches to the provision of social housing in the future.</p><p>  The Housing Agency is developing a strategy, in collaboration with my Department, for the utilisation of lands in its ownership which will support Government policies in developing sustainable communities.  This will involve consultation with the relevant local authority and other appropriate parties.  The proper management of all State land is critical; accordingly, both lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency and lands suitable for development but not transferred to the Agency will be the first sites considered in any targeted social housing building programme developed in the years ahead. </p></reply>

When taken with the estimated water costs of up to &euro;730 million that will be transferred from the local government sector to Irish Water this year, this represents a funding boost of approximately &euro;98 million to the sector in 2014 in comparison with the corresponding funding and costs for 2013.</p><p>  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, to be formed and registered under the Companies Act.  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 transferred statutory responsibility for water services to Irish Water and provided for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water, with this relationship being expressed through Service Level Agreements.  These agreements have now been signed by each authority and Irish Water and each included operational budgets appropriate to the cost of providing water services within each authority area.  Within this overall framework, the agreement of budgets with individual local authorities and the payments for services provided is a matter for Irish Water.</p><p>  The General Purpose Grant allocation for 2014 to Cork County includes all relevant town councils.  The information requested is set out in the table below.  The impact of the changed funding model for local authorities for 2014 is that GPG data is not comparable to previous years as it does not reflect the funding for water costs, previously provided through GPGs, which is now provided directly to local authorities by Irish Water.</p><p><b>Local Government Fund - General Purpose Grant Allocation</b><table><tr><th> -</th><th>2012 </th><th>2013 </th><th>*2014 </th></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td>&euro;33,495,626 </td><td>&euro;32,048,612 </td><td>&euro;2,951,435 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council </td><td>&euro;17,265,785 </td><td>&euro;16,612,544 </td><td>&euro;8,544,374 </td></tr></table></p><p><b>*</b> 2014 figures do not include funding for water services, now provided directly to local authorities by Irish Water.</p></reply>

To drive the reform agenda, and in particular shared service initiatives, in the local government sector, a dedicated Programme Management Office (PMO) has been established which reports to a high-level Oversight Group.  Overall, 31 operational areas are being examined for potential as a shared service or other collaborative approach that may provide efficiencies.  The PMO has adopted a comprehensive methodology for the development and evaluation of projects including gathering and analysing baseline data, business case preparation and peer review of business cases.</p><p>  Payroll/Superannuation, Building Control, Treasury Management, Procurement and Accounts Payable have been prioritised in the shared services programme in the short to medium term and the programme is being progressed using a lead authority model.  Following a competitive bidding process in 2013, Laois County Council was selected to provide Shared Payroll and Superannuation services on behalf of all local authorities and has established a shared services centre for that purpose in Portlaoise.  This shared service commenced in January 2014 and all local authorities will transition to it in waves in the period to 2016.  The Treasury Management shared services project is at the early stages of implementation, with Cork County Council as the lead local authority.  In relation to procurement, the local authority sector is working closely with the Office of Government Procurement to deliver significant savings over the coming years.</p></reply>

The legislative provisions contained in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 preclude either arrangement containing any terms which would require the debtor to make payments of such an amount that the debtor would not have sufficient income to maintain a reasonable standard of living for the debtor and his or her dependants.</p><p>  Initial guidelines as to what constitutes a reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses were published by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) in April 2013 and an updated guide issued in June 2013 to reflect adjustments for inflation.  The guidelines produced by the ISI are a modified version of the consensual budget standards model originally developed in Ireland by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice which has conducted research in Ireland for over 12 years on developing necessary expenditure figures for different types of households.  The guidelines received a general welcome from debtor advocacy groups for offering insolvent debtors protection in negotiations with creditors.</p><p>  It may be the case that where debtors have social welfare payments in addition to other income, a Family Income Supplement for example, then they have net disposable income in excess of the guidelines published by the ISI from which they are able to make payments to creditors as part of a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.  It should be noted that where a debtor qualifies for a Debt Relief Notice, payments to creditors from income will not be made at all unless the circumstances of the debtor improve in accordance with the provisions of the legislation over the three year period of the Notice. Ordinarily, debts subject to a Debt Relief Notice will be written off at the end of the three year period.</p></reply>

An application fee of &euro;175 is payable by all applicants for a certificate of naturalisation. A certification fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  The standard certification fee is payable where the applicant is the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen, whether they are an EU citizen or a national of another country.</p><p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Every application, including those made on the basis of marriage to an Irish citizen, must be assessed to establish if the statutory requirements are met.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware I have introduced formal citizenship ceremonies at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p></reply>

However, my Department has recently agreed a blueprint for record and data management and related issues and has assigned implementation to a senior responsible officer.  It is the intention of the Department, over the next two years, to review and refresh all areas relating to the management of data within the Department. In the short to medium term this will include  consideration of extending the role of the current officer to encompass a broader remit along the lines suggested in the Deputy's question.  It has to be acknowledged that while a great deal can be done in this area with the use of modern information technology, additional human resources may also be needed.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are competing demands for resources and that additional human resources are not available at present. However, the Department is examining how best this area can be developed and progressed within the existing resource constraints.</p></reply>

As part of the measures which are coordinated under Operation Fiacla, Operation Acer is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region, including the Crumlin District.  It is an intelligence driven operation and includes analysis led checkpoints and patrols to target specific areas and case manage targeted offenders.

I am advised that local Garda Management allocates resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that it is not An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policy to provide statistical information to the level of detail requested.

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.    The Deputy will also be aware that I established a Penal Policy Review Group to carry out a review incorporating an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including sentencing policies and the group is expected to report within the next few months.</p></reply>

This mirrors the provisions in the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) 2012, insofar as children and vulnerable persons are concerned. </p><p>  My Department is currently in the process of reviewing the provisions in the Vetting Act relating to the disclosure of convictions in light of a recent judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in R (On the Application of) T and others v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester [2013]. The UK Court considered the circumstances in which it is appropriate to disclose convictions for old, minor offences with particular regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Having considered the judgement in that case, I intend to bring proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the Vetting Act. Given the close relationship between that Act and the Spent Convictions Bill, any changes to the Vetting Act will have to be reflected in the Spent Convictions Bill.</p></reply>

With regard to legislative initiatives, among the Bills in the Government Legislation Programme is the Criminal Justice (Cybercrime) Bill. This Bill creates a range of offences to protect information systems and data from illegal access and interference. When enacted,  it will enable ratification by Ireland of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. It will also transpose EU Directive 2013/40 on attacks against information systems.  </p><p>  With regard to the investigation of cybercrime,  the strategy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area focuses on prevention, detection and training.    The Computer Crime Investigation Unit (CCIU) of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is the primary Garda unit responsible for investigating computer crime in Ireland. </p><p>  While the investigation of certain aspects of computer crime is undertaken directly by the CCIU, the Unit also provides expert assistance to Senior Investigating Officers and Investigation Teams tasked with the investigation of this type of criminality on a District and Divisional basis. </p><p>  Members of the CCIU also provide warnings to the public in relation to various types of cybercrime, including Computer viruses, Denial-of-service attacks, Malware (malicious code), Fraud and identity theft and Phishing scams.  The CCIU is also represented on the Irish Payment Card Service Organisation and the Irish Banking Federation High Tech Crime Forum.  </p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also regularly liaise with Interpol, Europol and the European Centre for Cyber Crime (EC3) which was established in 2013 under the auspices of Europol. </p><p>  In addition, a member of the CCIU is on full time secondment with CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team). The role of CERT, which was established under the auspices of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as part of a series of initiatives to deal with the general issue of cybersecurity, is to prepare and manage cyber incidents in conjunction with relevant stakeholders.</p><p>  I can also inform the Deputy that members of the CCIU continue to be trained in the techniques necessary to counter cybercrime including cyber forensic examination.  </p><p>  Within my own Department, the Office for Internet Safety has oversight of Hotline.ie, the confidential service that receives reports of suspected illegal content on the internet and, where appropriate, arranges to have such content removed. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy might also wish to note that cybercrime and organised crime were considered during the public consultation on the forthcoming White Paper on crime and that these subjects will be addressed in the White Paper.</p></reply>

One of the key principles underpinning this balance of interests is that family reunification should not cause an undue burden on the public finances.  The financial capacity of the sponsor is an important condition for family reunification and the guidelines also place greater emphasis on the question of dependency.  It is not credible that a person who is unable to support him/herself without assistance from the State can adequately fulfil the role of sponsor nor is it reasonable to assume that in the absence of such capacity, the State should undertake to do so from the public purse.</p><p>  This is a fundamental principle not alone in Ireland but throughout the EU and indeed in all countries which operate sensible policies and priorities in this regard.</p></reply>

Training is delivered through evening parades, weekend training days and periods of full time training.  In addition career course training and other specialist courses in personnel and logistics administration are conducted in the Defence Force Training College and the Formation Brigade Training Centres. </p><p>  Members of the AR and NSR undertake unpaid training and there is also provision made for them to avail of paid training. In 2013 1,734 members of the AR and NSR availed of 23,898 paid training man-days. However, members of the AR and NSR are not employed or engaged under a contract of employment which stipulates either weekly hours of work or working time and service with the AR and NSR is not pensionable under the Army Pension Schemes.</p><p>  In terms of paid training, members of the AR and NSR are generally paid at the 1st point of the pay scale of their equivalent rank in the Permanent Defence Force. Paid training for members of the AR and NSR is subject to PAYE and this requirement has been in place since 2008.  They are subject to PRSI contribution class M since 01 January 2011 as the introduction of the Universal Social Charge covers the Health Contribution aspect of PRSI (previously class K1 for Reservists). </p><p>  In line with the recommendations of the VFM Review of the Reserve Defence Force, gratuities were withdrawn from members of the AR and NSR at the end of 2012.  In the 2013 estimates this budget was re-allocated to paid training for members of the AR and NSR.  This measure was introduced to ensure an appropriate paid training allocation for the revised organisational establishment of 4,069 personnel and to ensure continued viability of the Reserve.</p><p>  Terms and conditions for members of the First Line Reserve (FLR) are outlined in Defence Forces Regulation R1 and Defence Forces Regulation R2. Membership of the FLR is confined to personnel who have completed a term of engagement with the Permanent Defence Force and have undertaken, either voluntarily or on foot of a contractual commitment, to complete a period of service in the FLR. The FLR has not actively trained in recent years. In line with the recommendations of the VFM Review of the Reserve Defence Force, the military authorities are currently developing proposals regarding the FLR for my consideration.

Six high wheeled trucks and 25 personnel were deployed each day.  On Saturday they were involved in assisting with the evacuation of flooded homes, whilst on Sunday they were involved in the distribution of supplies and assisting with the filling and distribution of sandbags.  On Wednesday 5 February, 25 members of the Defence Forces were deployed to fill sandbags in Limerick. </p><p>  The Naval Service positioned a ship in Cork harbour to be on hand should any assistance be required during the expected high tide in Cork on the evening of the 4th February.  Personnel from Collins Barracks, Cork were also on standby for deployment. </p><p>  In response to a request from the HSE, the Defence Forces transported and installed a generator in a dwelling in West Cork on 14 February 2014 to assist a vulnerable patient who had no electricity. </p><p>  Civil Defence, which comes under the remit of my Department, was also actively involved in dealing with the effects of the recent severe weather.

As the catching sector is by definition dependant on being able to go out and catch fish, and crews earn their living through a share of the catch, many fishermen are suffering financially because of this extended period restricted to port.  With the present long overdue break in the weather, I am happy to report that many of the vessels that were harbour bound due to the severe weather are now back fishing and eagerly seeking to make up for lost time.</p><p>  I always work very closely with the fishing industry, and I am advised by it when setting catch limits during the year.  Each month, a Quota Management Advisory Committee involving industry representatives and experts from my Department meet and examine available quota, uptake levels and the market situation and make recommendations to me on catch limits for the following month. Given the difficult financial situation faced by many fishermen because of their restricted fishing opportunities so far this year, I have asked for the Quota Management Advisory Committee to meet this Friday with a view to immediately reviewing upwards the catch limits for February and March. The objective of the meeting will be to secure industry support with a view to immediately increasing quotas available to fishermen to allow them catch more fish in the coming weeks, if the weather continues to be suitable for fishing, allowing them to increase their income to compensate for their earlier losses. </p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has the overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in the circumstances that have arisen.  Minister Burton&rsquo;s Department runs a number of schemes to support people in circumstances of loss of income. </p><p>  While the co-legislators have reached political agreement on the proposed Regulation establishing the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, it will not be adopted in law until probably June this year.  My Department is working to prepare a new Operational Programme for the seafood sector under the EMFF.  That Programme is dependent on the progress of the proposed Regulation and so is likely to be finalised towards the end of the year.  Decisions on what to do with the finite resources available to Ireland under that Operational Programme will be a key element of that work and I am working closely with all stakeholders in making those hard choices between many competing and worthwhile investment priorities.  It is thus premature from both a legal and practical perspective to consider employing the EMFF to assist fishermen in the present situation.</p></reply>

The Marine Institute is responsible for monitoring shellfish for the presence of naturally occurring phytoplankton toxins. Toxicity can occur at any time during the year and the periods of closure can vary considerably from year-to-year. The monitoring programme is designed to detect toxicity in shellfish growing areas before harvesting, thereby providing the necessary information to restrict the placement of toxic shellfish on the market. Regulatory controls, which are enforced by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, exist to support these restrictions. The State controls are there to protect public health and indeed the international reputation of Irish seafood thereby ensuring the future of this important sector.  </p><p>  Killary Harbour has been on a closed biotoxin status for azaspiracid toxins since last June and I understand was closed for some months prior to April 2013 also.  Azaspiracid shellfish poisoning can cause diarrhoea, nausea, headaches and chills.  I know that some other areas in the South West and North West have been similarly affected and I understand that Killary Harbour has a history of similar toxicity events in the past.  These naturally occurring events are an inevitable occasional feature of operating aquaculture farms in Irish coastal waters and are a well known business risk in the industry.   Nevertheless, I am still conscious of the business difficulties that these closures can cause for the companies concerned.  </p><p>  The European Fisheries Fund Regulation (1198/2006) is an EU instrument that sets out details of the type of investments that Member States may select for inclusion in national operational programmes for the seafood sector.  Investments included in operational programmes are co-funded by the EFF and national administrations and are considered to comply with State Aid rules once the operational programme is adopted by the Commission.  There are many potential investments in the EFF Regulation and Member States are not expected to include all in their operational programmes.  Each member state must make investment choices, having regard to the finite allocation from the EFF to each Member State.  Ireland&rsquo;s Seafood Development Programme was finalised in 2008 and Ireland selected certain investments for inclusion, in consultation with stakeholders, and having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s EFF allocation of &euro;42 million over 7 years.  A scheme of compensation for biotoxin closures under article 31 was not included because of limited EFF funds and competing priorities.  </p><p>  Exchequer funds for development of the seafood sector are constrained in the present economic environment and are prioritised towards implementation of the EU co-funded Operational Programme.  I regret there are no funds available to me to assist the businesses in Killary Harbour with their present difficulties.  </p></reply>

In this context, my Department has been collaborating for some years with the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA) in UCD and with DEFRA in the United Kingdom on research into a vaccine to control tuberculosis in badgers and to break the link of infection to cattle.  Research has demonstrated that oral vaccination of badgers in a captive environment with BCG vaccine generates high levels of protective immunity against bovine TB.  Field trials are also being undertaken at present, involving the vaccination of several hundred badgers over 3 to 4 years, with continuous monitoring of the population to assess the impact of the vaccine on the incidence of disease in the vaccinated and non-vaccinated control badger populations. Success in the field trials is designed to eventually lead to implementation of a vaccination strategy as part of the national TB control programme. As it will be some years before full results of the trials will be available, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term.</p><p>Conclusions about the success of badger removal, in terms of bovine TB levels, cannot be reached on the basis of a single year&rsquo;s results.  Rather, trends over a number of years have to be taken into account and it is the case that there has been a very significant improvement in the TB situation in recent years and, in particular, since 2008: the number of reactors has declined by almost 50% from around 30,000 in 2008 to 15,600 last year<font color="#004080">, </font>which represented a 15 % reduction on 2012 levels.<font color="#004080"> </font>   This is a new record low since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s and, for the first time since the programme was introduced in the 1950s, eradication is now a practicable proposition. The improved situation has also resulted in a significant reduction in expenditure on the TB eradication scheme, which has fallen from &euro;55 m in 2008 to &euro;30 m in 2013.</p><p>While it is difficult to quantify the precise impact of badger culling on the reduction in the incidence of TB in Ireland over the past 10 years or so, my Department believes that much of the improvement is in fact due to the badger removal programme. In this regard, it is noteworthy that a recent peer-reviewed study, <i>Bovine tuberculosis trends in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, 1995&ndash;2010 (Abernethy et al., 2013),</i>   published in the Veterinary Record, found that, during the period studied, the animal incidence of TB increased by 380% in England, by 190% in Wales and by 74% in Northern Ireland. On the other hand, the animal incidence in Ireland fell by 32% in the same period (and by a further 20% since the study). Significantly, the removal of badgers is not practised in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. </p><p>  The badger removal policy was introduced in light of research conducted over the years by the Department and others which demonstrated that the eradication of Bovine TB is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed.  Capturing of badgers is not permitted during the months of  February and March (the breeding season) in new capture areas.  It is not proposed to extend this period to May. </p><p>  With regard to the badger population, a complaint by the Irish Wildlife Trust that badgers in Ireland were under threat was dismissed by the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention which noted Ireland&rsquo;s badger population is not being threatened and that badger numbers are being maintained at safe low levels. While estimating wild animal populations is a difficult task, current estimates are that badger numbers in the Republic of Ireland are in the range of 70,000-90,000. In addition, even in those lands where badger populations are being controlled, the local density of badgers is on a par or greater than the norms found on mainland Europe. Furthermore, Department sponsored research in collaboration with Teagasc is being finalised that concludes that badgers in Ireland are abundant everywhere and not under any threat of extinction.  This research will be published shortly when it has completed the peer review process.</p></reply>

The Adoption (Information and Tracing ) Bill will address this matter but the legislature will be constrained in the nature of any access which can be granted to adoption records by these legal issues. My Department is continuing to work on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible.  It is necessary for me to be open in saying that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill. A particular difficulty has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person&rsquo;s request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent. My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues and I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  </p><p>  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration. The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.   In the meantime I am open to any proposals or suggestions in relation to policy on this matter that assists in achieving as much access as possible in a manner that is legally and constitutionally sound. </p><p>  I have been anxious to see improvements in existing procedures for the tracing of birth parents by people who have been adopted.  The Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1st January last, has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the Agency implement much more improved and consistent arrangements. I have been advised by the  Agency that it is reorganising adoption services in 2014 at a national level,  and will consider how best to deploy its staff to deal with this important issue so as to facilitate access to records where they exist. </p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring records from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Agency.  In the case of the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, for example, some 25,000 records have been transferred to the Agency&rsquo;s Regional Adoption Service in Cork.  Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these records has taken place.  The advice of the National Archives has been sought in relation to the proper storage of these records that are of great significance. </p><p>  I have raised the importance of arrangements for the management of these records directly with the Child and Family Agency and I have also asked my officials to examine the work that could be undertaken with the Child and Family Agency, the Adoption Authority and other stakeholders to improve arrangements for managing and accessing the records that are available. </p><p>  I would urge birth mothers to enrol on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register which was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  Applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register.  I believe there is an opportunity in the context of the considerable public attention this area is receiving to promote awareness amongst women whose children were adopted of the importance of registering their consent for contact to be re-established.   </p></reply>

As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department. The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, "Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth" (FACCT).  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007.  In addition, a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) will commence shortly.</p><p>  The Forum on Fluoridation, established in 2000, reviewed the policy of water fluoridation and recommended in 2002 that it should continue as a public health measure.  In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. </p></reply>

This standardised framework will uniformly assess dependancy levels, allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The first phase of implementation of the SAT will commence in 2014 with a minimum of 50% of all new entries to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, Home Care Package and Home Help Schemes assessed by the SAT in the last quarter of 2014, with full implementation of SAT by the end of 2015.</p></reply>

However,  year to date on a national basis we are 2.2% ahead of 2013 and 33.4% ahead of the baseline 2011 trolley count. These percentages are equivalent to 211 and 4,649 fewer patients on trolleys respectively. </p><p>  I am advised by the HSE that the Emergency Department in Beaumont Hospital has been under pressure for some weeks. Since the start of 2014, the rate of admission to the hospital from the ED has increased from just below 1 in 5 patients attending its ED to just below 1 in 3.  This indicates that those presenting so far this year have tended to be sicker and requiring more care and treatment.  Notwithstanding this, Beaumont has achieved reductions in the first 7 weeks of 2014, as it did also in 2013:</p><p>  Beaumont Hospital: Patients on Trolleys for first 7 weeks of the year:  2012 / 2013 / 2014<table><tr><th>W/ending</th><th>Number of patients on trolleys</th></tr><tr><td>10 February 2012</td><td>1,001</td></tr><tr><td>8 February 2013</td><td>941</td></tr><tr><td>14 February 2014</td><td>850</td></tr></table></p><p><i>Data published on Department website at </i></p><p>  Beaumont has taken a number of steps already to cope with the increased demand.  All of the 15 beds that were closed have been re-opened. Routine elective procedures have been postponed and additional capacity for diagnostic tests at weekends has opened.  Consultants and senior medical staff engage in regular ward rounds to ensure that patients are identified for discharge as appropriate in a timely manner. Access has been provided for Beaumont patients to twelve additional beds in nursing homes to reduce delayed discharges. The number of patients awaiting long-term care has reduced from 85 at 28 November 2013 to 63 at 30 January 2014. In terms of staffing, all medical posts have been filled since January and an additional six nurses were appointed in the last nine weeks. </p><p>  As with all hospitals experiencing pressure in the early weeks of 2014, Beaumont Hospital is making ongoing process improvements in its Emergency Department, its Acute Medical Assessment Unit (AMAU) and in-patient wards, in collaboration with the SDU and HSE.  These measures have led to significant improvements in the patient experience times in Emergency Departments.</p></reply>

Under agreements dated the 16 March 1983 and 24 November 1983, the latter being in consideration for the loss of limited berthage and the disposal of certain lands, Dublin Port Company acquired the right to participate in the future profits of the Toll Scheme for a period of 25 years from the date on which the building costs were finally discharged or until 31 December 2015, whichever date first occurs. The appropriate date, therefore, is 31 December 2015.  Under these aforementioned agreements it is my understanding that Dublin Port Company received &euro;1.1million for each of the years 2012 and 2011 for example.  The figures are disclosed in the Company&rsquo;s publically available annual accounts.</p></reply>

I have discussed these issues, and how they are being addressed, with the acting CEO of the RSA.  The RSA acknowledged that there were teething problems when the service opened.  Some were technical and systems issues, while others related to new staff becoming familiar with rules and processes around driving licences and permits.</p><p>   The RSA has increased resources in NDLS centres experiencing delays, as well as in the licence processing centre, and provided further training to staff.  There are no major technical difficulties now affecting the service.  Following a successful pilot phase, a booking system to allow for customers to make appointments is now being extended on a phased basis to all NDLS offices.</p><p>  While I understand that there are still some backlogs in relation to applications, the situation has improved.  I have been informed that licence applications that are fully and correctly completed are being issued in a shorter timeframe than previously and work is continuing to achieve the target turnaround period of 5 to 8 days.  The RSA has assured me that the remaining backlog has largely been cleared.  The NDLS can also respond to urgent situations where a licence is needed for travel abroad or for work purposes.  I have been assured by the RSA that it does not give out email copies of licences.  There is a quite separate document known as a letter of entitlement, or driver statement, for which individuals may apply.  It sets out details from the individual's driver record.  The process of applying for this document, which costs &euro;15, is separate from the driver licence application.</p></reply>

These regulations were signed into law on the 1st of November 2008 by my predecessor, Minister Noel Dempsey.  These regulations allowed a five year derogation from that limit for vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to 1 November 2008.  The derogation was introduced to allow a five-year period within which vehicles operating at heights in excess of the new limits could be withdrawn from use or to allow the necessary height reductions by operators.  This derogation expired on 31 October last.</p><p>  The original reasoning behind the limit was mainly concerned with rail safety, the protection of expensive physical infrastructure, road safety, and quality of life considerations for residents in urban areas through which high sided vehicles may have to travel. In light of the foregoing, I did not extend the derogation in relation to vehicle heights as this would have the effect of ensuring that those operators who were pro-actively compliant with this legislation would continue to be at a competitive disadvantage, while those that did not comply would benefit. On a broader point, it would send the message that derogation deadlines set in transport matters are not serious and that companies should not make any effort to comply with them.</p><p>  Following the expiry of the derogation, specific concerns have been raised with me by the agri-sector in relation to the effect that the 4.65 metre maximum vehicle height restriction would have on the cost of transporting fodder.  Unfortunately, these concerns were only raised by the sector since the expiry of the 5 year derogation in October last, and not prior to the 2008 regulations being signed into law nor in the subsequent five years.  Notwithstanding this, I have considered the various issues involved, consulted with my colleague Minister Coveney, with Irish Rail and farming representative bodies  and arising from this have asked my officials to draft regulations to allow for a very narrow exemption for the haulage of agricultural fodder, i.e. straw and hay only, from the height limits brought in by the 2008 regulations. </p></reply>
