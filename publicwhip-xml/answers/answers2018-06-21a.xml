    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-21a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062100039#WRA00600"><p>At the outset, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that funding for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht has actually increased over the past year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Foras na Gaeilge is charged with promotion of the Irish language on an all-island basis, and provides support, advice and financial assistance to many groups, including the six lead organisations.  These groups work to promote the language, including provision of courses and activities to help people improve or learn the language.  </p>  <p>  An Foras Teanga, as a North South Implementation Body comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency, is co-funded by my Department along with the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland and its budget is subject to approval by the North South Ministerial Council.  The dispersal of Foras na Gaeilge's allocated budget is an operational matter for the organisation, within the framework of the NSMC-approved business plan and budget.</p>  <p>  An indicative provision of &euro;14.028m is included in the 2018 Revised Estimates for An Foras Teanga to cover NSMC budgets for Foras na Gaeilge, the Ulster-Scots Agency, Cl&aacute;r na Leabhar Gaeilge and Colmcille.  I would also like to remind the Deputy that I secured an additional allocation to Foras na Gaeilge of &euro;450,000 for Bliain na Gaeilge 2018, which is being delivered primarily by Conradh na Gaeilge.</p>  <p>  In order to further underpin the implementation of the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and particularly the language planning process as set out in Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, a specific allocation of &euro;2.65m has been provided to my Department in the current year.  This represents a significant increase from the &euro;500,000 allocated for this purpose in 2014. This will further enable my Department, acting in concert with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Foras na Gaeilge and other relevant stakeholders at community level, to implement a range of specific and practical measures aimed at both supporting the implementation of the Strategy and the language planning process. </p>  <p>  Under my Department's Irish Language Support Schemes, financial assistance is provided to a range of organisations and activities that support the promotion of the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht.  Under this programme, funding is provided for Irish language courses in third-level institutions in Ireland and overseas, for the promotion of the language in the business sector and for terminology initiatives which support the status of Irish as an official and working language of the European Union. These schemes have contributed greatly to some of the most innovative work being done in relation to the language in recent years. In 2018 the allocation for this programme was increased by &euro;787,000.</p>  <p>  These increases in funding by my Department to Irish language organisations has resulted over the past number of years in an increased level of activities being delivered which, in turn, has a positive impact on the promotion of the Irish language and culture.</p></reply>

The allocation for the 2018 scheme is &euro;1.324m. </p><p>The 2018 Structures at Risk Fund was announced by the then Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys, in November 2017 and open to the public for applications until 31 January 2018. The SRF is generally administered by local authorities, who receive applications from members of the public and select projects to put forward to my Department for funding. </p><p>A total of 228 applications were submitted to local authorities in 2018, of which 128 applications were shortlisted by the local authorities and submitted to my Department for assessment. A total of 76 projects were approved for funding.  Due to the volume of applications received this year, and the high standard of applications generally, it was not possible to fund every eligible project. </p><p>Applications were assessed by an expert panel within my Department in accordance with assessment criteria as set out the Circular governing the scheme, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and all local authority websites. These criteria are:</p><p>- Significance of the Structure </p><p>- Urgency of the Works </p><p>- Quality of the Method Statement </p><p>- Efficacy of the Works </p><p>Details of all of the projects approved for funding under Structures at Risk in 2018 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and all local authority websites.  </p><p>In relation to a particular historic structure, the best advice for the owner or applicant is generally to contact the Architectural Conservation Officer in the local authority who is well placed to offer advice and assistance in relation to the grants and supports available, as well as providing feedback on grant applications and other specialist advice on building conservation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-21a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062100039#WRA01200"><p>In accordance with regulations under the Planning and Development Act, 2000 as amended, planning applications lodged with planning authorities that have the potential to impact on built, archaeological, or natural heritage must be referred to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.   The Minister is one of a number of such statutory consultees sometimes known as prescribed bodies. </p>  <p>  In any such capacity, the Minister may make submissions or observations to assist the responsible authority in carrying out its functions, including consent functions, in compliance with various legislative and administrative requirements with respect to the conservation, protection and preservation of natural and built heritage.</p>  <p>  Since 1 November 2011, some 30,722 planning applications were referred to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department in my role as a statutory consultee.  Of this number, 3,476  were referrals within County Donegal.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service had no comments to make to the planning authorities on 2,591 cases.  In a number of these cases, the NPWS considered that the referrals were not relevant to nature conservation.</p>  <p>  The European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations, 2011 sets out that public authorities having, or exercising functions, including consent functions, which may have implications for or effects on nature conservation, must exercise those functions, so as to secure compliance with the requirements of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive and the Regulations.   All planning authorities are considered to be public authorities within the meaning of the 2011 Regulations.  In that regard, public authorities are obliged to ensure, amongst other things that they do not give consent to any party, for any plan or project that may adversely affect the integrity of a European site (SAC or SPA).</p>  <p>  A public authority that has been assigned responsibility, such as a consent function, is the relevant authority for undertaking those responsibilities and as Minister I am prohibited from doing so.</p>  <p>  Any observations made on development applications referred to me are to assist planning authorities. Ultimately, however  the decision to grant planning permission is under law a matter for the relevant planning authority irrespective of whether or not a comment had been made by my Department.   Accordingly, there is no breach of national or EU law.</p></reply>

I understand that there was one application from Clare under the  Scheme this year from Corofin Tourism &amp;amp; Traders association for the Festival of Finn. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I will be providing the Festival of Finn with a grant of up to &euro;2,000 towards festival activities.</p>  <p>  In addition, Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is taking place on Saturday, June 23rd in every local authority right across the country.  There are over 500 free events happening for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g nationwide, with 13 of these events happening in County Clare.  These events include magic shows, craft workshops, film screenings, mask making, story telling, African dance among others. My Department is providing &euro;10,000 to Clare County Council to support these events.</p>  <p>  Building on the success of last year's Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca events, it was decided this year to focus on children and young people and the development of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is now a key initiative of the Creative Youth Plan to enable the creativity of every child and young person.  </p>  <p>  Underlying the Creative Youth Plan, of which Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is one of 18 actions, is a firm conviction that participation in creative and cultural activities from dancing to singing to coding equips our young people to flourish in their personal lives and helps give them skills that will stand to them throughout their lives.</p>  <p>  Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is a day dedicated to celebrating and encouraging children and young people to participate in a range of cultural and creative activities through performance, coding, theatre, art and music workshops, readings, screenings, special events and much more. It&rsquo;s a day for &lsquo;doing&rsquo;, &lsquo;making&rsquo; and &lsquo;creating&rsquo; and I am sure that it will be enjoyed by communities and families all around the country including in County Clare. </p>  <p>  Local Authorities have been key to the delivery of this initiative and are a vital element of the Creative Ireland Programme. This year, my Department doubled the funding allocation from &euro;1m to &euro;2m  for the 31 local authorities to deliver the Creative Ireland Programme at local level and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government provided &euro;1m.  Local  authorities are currently finalising 5 year culture and creativity strategies and I look forward to publishing these shortly.</p></reply>

This initiative is in existence since 2008 and has proved very popular over the past decade.</p>  <p>  In May of this year, a total of &euro;224,000 in capital grants was allocated to performing groups and individual musicians for the 2017- 2018 academic year.  </p>  <p>  The Music Capital Scheme is designed to provide support for the purchase of musical instruments, and to respond to a broad range of capital needs within the music sector in Ireland. A particular area of difficulty for musicians and ensembles is purchasing musical instruments. The cost of instrument purchase, maintenance and repair can be significant barriers to the development of many organisations and this scheme aims to address this.</p>  <p>  The capital scheme is made of two distinct awards &ndash; Streams one and two - which provide funding towards the purchase of musical instruments both to performing groups and individual musicians at a professional performing standard.</p>  <p>  Stream One Awards provide &euro;160,000 towards the purchase of musical instruments to not-for-profit and community music groups across a wide range of musical genres including Marching/Concert/Pipe Bands, Multi-genre, Irish Traditional, Popular Contemporary, Choral and Samba.  A total of &euro;35,000 of this amount was ring-fenced funding for prioritised counties in this case Counties Kerry, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan, Roscommon and Tipperary.</p>  <p>  Stream Two Awards provided &euro;64,000 to 17 highly skilled musicians performing at professional level to assist with the purchase of instruments/equipment. Musical genres covered in these allocations were as diverse as Irish Traditional, Classical, Jazz/Improvised, Punk/Electro-acoustic and Early/Baroque.</p>  <p>  Music Network partnered with Local Authority Arts Offices to provide Music Capital Scheme information sessions that offered practical advice to applicants as well as addressing specific queries relating to the scheme&rsquo;s guidelines.   </p>  <p>  The Music Capital Scheme is a fantastic initiative which has benefitted thousands of people since the scheme was set up in 2008. The Music Capital Scheme is a key resource for musical groups and talented musicians. Over the last 10 years it has helped musicians who, for lack of a decent instrument, may have otherwise struggled to achieve their full potential. </p>  <p>  Full details of the scheme and a list of awardees can be accessed in the Music Network website.</p></reply>

In that regard, public authorities are obliged to ensure that they do not undertake or adopt, or give consent to any party, for any plan or project that may adversely affect the integrity of a European site. A public authority that has been assigned responsibility, such as a consent function, is the relevant authority for undertaking those responsibilities and, as Minister, I am prohibited from doing so.</p>  <p>  In accordance with regulations under the Planning and Development Act, 2000 as amended, proposed developments that have the potential to impact on the built, archaeological, or natural heritage must be referred to me as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I am one of a number of such statutory consultees or prescribed bodies as they are sometimes known. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, 18 large scale road projects from various locations around the country have been referred to officials of my Department in the National Parks and Wildlife Service. In 8 of these cases further information was requested, in 2 cases conditions in relation to nature conservation were recommended and in 8 cases no comments or observations were made.</p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the decision-making authority for large scale road projects. My Department&rsquo;s role at the planning application stage of large scale road projects, as with all planning and development applications, is to provide advice to the decision-making authority to assist the authority in carrying out its functions.  Ultimately, decisions to grant planning permission for various developments is a matter for planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanala, and I have no function in this regard.</p></reply>

It&rsquo;s a day for &lsquo;doing&rsquo;, &lsquo;making&rsquo; and &lsquo;creating&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  It is an initiative of the Creative Ireland Programme, and is being supported and led by the local Creative Ireland Programme Culture teams across all local authorities, with huge support from local artists, arts and youth organisations and community festivals.  This year's activities include everything from bicycle tyre painting and bee-hotel making to robotics and smart phone film making.  There are also lots of interesting workshops for everyone from early years (0-4 years) to teenagers in visual arts, creative writing, coding, music-making, theatre, crafts and dance.  </p>  <p>  There are over 500 free events happening for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g nationwide, with 13 of these events happening in County Clare.

Conservation Rangers are deployed through a regional structure and assignments are determined in light of Departmental business needs and priorities. </p>  <p>  Under "Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage, 2018 - 2027&rdquo; capital investment of some &euro;50m has been earmarked for the National Parks and Nature Reserves. This investment ensures long term protection of the National Parks and Reserves and my Department is delighted to have the opportunity for investment and implementation of measures to protect our habitats, landscapes and wildlife.</p>  <p>  This funding envelope will allow us to develop a major investment programme for our National Parks, improving visitor facilities and information, improve signage, as well as developing trails, maintain existing trails and walkways and invest in new routes. We will provide better access to nature and protect the natural heritage in the parks. This investment will ensure that we can seek alternative access to parks and lessen the impact of rising visitor numbers and balance conservation with this increase in tourism.  It means we will be able to showcase our beautiful habitats and improve visitor experiences simultaneously.  </p>  <p>  &ldquo;Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland&rdquo;- a Tourism Interpretative Masterplan for the National Parks is presently being finalised. It is intended that this report will guide the phased development of these enhanced visitor facilities and improved visitor experiences based on research into international best practice.    </p>  <p>  I&rsquo;m aware that an important area of concern for the Deputy is  that of compliance with the Wildlife Acts and addressing wildlife crime. I want to acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s assistance to my officials in bringing some egregious matters to their attention. I recall too that I undertook to look to address the resources in this area when I could and I can assure the Deputy that this remains a priority for me.</p></reply>

Every local authority has been allocated &euro;10,000 to fund a programme of local activities while there will be a special programme of activities across Dublin City.</p>  <p>  - Annual funding of &euro;1.6m is provided to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;) in 2018 for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture. CC&Eacute; provides weekly classes at community level in all traditional instruments, singing, and dance through its network of centres and branches all over the country. </p>  <p>  - The provision of support for the purchase of equipment under the Music Capital Scheme to performing groups and individual talented musicians.

While the current content of the Record of Monuments and Places remains as established in the late 1990s, work is underway on revision and updating of all records on a national basis, this being a necessary precursor to the issuing of a revised listing for each county. The monuments proposed for inclusion in a revised Record of Monuments and Places, along with existing entries, are listed in the non-statutory Sites and Monuments Record which may be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website. The number of additions made to the Sites and Monuments Record in the last five years is 3,862.</p>  <p>  The National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2014 define &ldquo;national monument&rdquo; as meaning (in summary) any monument the preservation of which is a matter of national importance  by reason of the historical, architectural, traditional, artistic, or archaeological interest attaching to it. Therefore, the Minister does not have, under the Acts, a function as such of designating monuments as national monuments other than by way of the exercise of a number of specified functions under the Acts which she may, at her discretion, exercise in respect of a monument which, in her opinion, are national monuments. These functions are the power to make preservation orders or temporary preservation orders in respect of national monuments which are in danger, the power to become guardian of a national monument and the power to acquire national monuments. There have been two instances of acquisition in the period in question.</p></reply>

It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m nationally for this Scheme in 2018. In 2017 and 2018, the Built Heritage Investment Scheme provided a total &euro;174,382 in grant aid for 34 projects in County Offaly. </p><p>The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  I have allocated &euro;1.324m nationally for the Structures at Risk Fund 2018. In 2017 and 2018 a total of &euro;42,000 was allocated to two projects in County Offaly under the Structures at Risk Fund. </p><p>Details of the projects approved for funding under both schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and local authority websites.</p><p>My Department has provided &euro;350,000 in funding to the OPW<b></b>in 2018 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership. The two Departments continue to work closely together on survey, excavation and research work relating to our national monuments.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes for 2018 are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p><p>In terms of future funding, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 represents a major capital investment scheme of close to &euro;1.3 billion in funding over the next 10 years. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

The new Plan demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s continuing commitment to meeting and acting on its obligations to protect our biodiversity for the benefit of future generations through a series of targeted strategies and actions.</p>  <p>  The Plan reiterates Ireland&rsquo;s Vision for Biodiversity: that in the future &ldquo;biodiversity and ecosystems in Ireland are conserved and restored, delivering benefits essential for all sectors of society and that Ireland contributes to efforts to halt the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems in the EU and globally&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The NBAP is a National Plan and, while my Department is the lead agency in development and coordination of the Plan, its implementation depends on engagement across a range of Government departments and agencies, as well as local authorities and other stakeholders across sectors in Ireland. </p>  <p>  As a Party to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Ireland has made a commitment to prepare Action Plans towards the achievement of the Convention&rsquo;s targets:  namely to secure the conservation of biological diversity; sustainable use of its components; and the equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources.  Many of the targeted actions in the Plan also contribute towards Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under EU environmental directives.</p>  <p>  The Plan contains 119 actions under a framework of seven strategic objectives. These encompass mainstreaming biodiversity into decision making across all sectors; strengthening the knowledge base for the conservation, management and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services; increasing awareness and appreciation of biodiversity and ecosystem services; conserving and restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services in the wider countryside; conserving and restoring ecosystem services in the marine environment; expanding and improving management of protected areas and species; and strengthening international governance for biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p>  <p>  The objectives in the NBAP lay out a clear framework for our national approach to biodiversity and will ensure that we build on the efforts and achievements of the past while looking ahead to what we can achieve over the next five years and beyond. </p>  <p>  The National Biodiversity Action Plan is available for download at the website of my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service (www.npws.ie).</p></reply>

Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government&rsquo;s international promotion strategy in tandem with other relevant Government Agencies. </p><p>This year, Culture Ireland is presenting Culture Ireland GB18, a year-long programme of Irish arts in Great Britain that aims to showcase Irish artistic excellence in partnership with significant UK institutions, venues and festivals, to build on the unique (and in many respects shared) cultural relationship between the two countries and expand the reach of Irish culture to new audiences.</p><p>Great Britain is a key market for Ireland in terms of tourism, trade and investment promotion and the GB18 programme enables us to use our culture and heritage as a unique door-opener for Ireland and Irish business, and an effective means of articulating our values at a time of change in Ireland's wider relationship with Britain.</p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme led by my Department designed to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. Its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.</p><p>Pillar I - 'Enabling the Creative Potential of Children' and Pillar II - 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community' of the Programme will see considerable investment this year in highlighting numerous events of a cultural and heritage nature across the country. </p><p>For instance, a sum of &euro;3m (&euro;2m from my Department and &euro;1m from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government) has been allocated to all 31 local authorities (&euro;96,000 each approximately) to enable them support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county. This will include the launch of long-term creative strategies for each local authority which will be launched later this year. </p><p>In addition, each local authority has been allocated funding to host Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, a day of day of youthful creativity that will be held this weekend coming (23 June 2018) and which is specifically targeted at children and young people. Over 500 free events are happening for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g nationwide, further details of which can be found at  <i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i></p><p>It should be noted that the Arts Council, the main Irish Government agency for developing the arts, works in partnership with and provides funding for arts, artists, arts organisations, public policy makers and others to build a central place for the arts in Irish life.  Festivals, and cultural events are important in this context.</p><p>We will continue to work across Government in 2018, to further enhance Ireland's cultural and artistic reputation, particularly in the context of the recently launched ten-year plan &quot;Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027&quot; which sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage.

Our national monument portfolio also includes more modern structures such as the eighteenth-century terrace at 14-17 Moore Street.  These sites benefit from the full protection of the National Monuments Acts.   </p>  <p>  Sites in my ownership or guardianship are maintained by the Office of Public Works. Conservation matters in relation to these sites are managed through regular liaison between the OPW and my Department, identifying condition issues and proposing appropriate conservation actions, carried out under consent where relevant. </p>  <p>  Under the National Monuments Acts, local authorities are responsible for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. </p>  <p>  The recent securing by my Department of &euro;30 million over the next 10 years for our national monument estate will enable my Department, working closely with the OPW to identify, resource and implement necessary conservation measures to ensure these wonderful sites, some dating back almost 6,000 years, will continue to  be enjoyed for generations to come.</p>  <p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. </p>  <p>  I draw on information provided by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, maintained by my Department, to recommend structures for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.  The final decision, however, is a reserved function of the planning authority.  </p>  <p>  Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), my Department manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. The existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, and they are &lsquo;core assets&rsquo; which play a very important role in Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry. </p>  <p>  In addition to the statutory role of Local Authorities, Financial support is provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.  &euro;2m has been provided for the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2018 and 370 projects have been approved for funding. &euro;1,324,000 has been provided for the Structures at Risk Fund 2018 and 76 projects across the country have been approved for funding.</p>  <p>  In terms of funding for future years, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 represents a major capital investment scheme of close to &euro;1.3 billion in funding over the next 10 years. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

It&rsquo;s a day for &lsquo;doing&rsquo;, &lsquo;making&rsquo; and &lsquo;creating&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  Local Authorities have been key to the delivery of this initiative and are a vital element of the Creative Ireland Programme.  This year, my Department doubled the funding allocation from &euro;1m to &euro;2m  for the 31 local authorities to deliver the Creative Ireland Programme at local level and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government provided &euro;1m.  Local  authorities are currently finalising 5 year culture and creativity strategies and I look forward to publishing these shortly.</p></reply>

Pending completion of these Treaty procedures, the Heads of State and Government declared that the Decision would be legally binding and take effect from the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon which occurred on 1 December 2009. The Decision is published on the Irish Treaty Series as No. 20 of 2010.Ireland duly instigated the Treaty amendment process by submitting a proposal in accordance with Article 48 TEU, which governs the &ldquo;ordinary revision procedure&rdquo; for amending the Treaties. After positive consideration by the European Parliament in April 2012 and the Commission in May 2012, by a Decision of 11 May 2012 the European Council decided that a conference of the representatives of the governments of the Member States should examine the amendments proposed by Ireland in the form of a Protocol on the Concerns of the Irish People on the Treaty of Lisbon, to be annexed to the TEU and TFEU. The European Council further decided that in view of the extent of the proposed amendments, a Convention under Article 48(3) TEU need not be convened. The Protocol on the Concerns of the Irish People on the Treaty of Lisbon was submitted to a written procedure which closed on 16 May 2012 and was subsequently opened for signature.</p><p>Following its ratification by all EU Member States, the Protocol entered into force on 1 December 2014. The Protocol was published in the Irish Treaty Series as No. 25 of 2014 and laid before the D&aacute;il on 17 December 2014. In the most recent consolidated version of the EU Treaties, the Protocol is included as Protocol No. 38. In accordance with Article 51 TEU, the Protocols form an integral part of the Treaties. </p><p>Section 1, paragraph (iv) of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 2012 amended section 1(1) of the European Communities Act 1972 so as to include a reference to the Protocol within the definition of the &ldquo;treaties governing the European Union&rdquo;, which are to be binding on the State and part of the domestic law thereof. The section was commenced on 1 December 2014 by Statutory Instrument No. 577 of 2014 so as to coincide with the entry into force of the Protocol.</p><p>The Protocol stipulates, <i>inter alia, </i>that the Treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality, that any decision to move to a common defence will require a unanimous decision of the European Council and that it would then be a matter for Member States, including Ireland, to decide, in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements, whether or not to adopt a common defence.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, participation in a common defence is precluded by Article 29.4.9 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.</p></reply>

She has been in administrative detention without trial for a year, having already been detained, under administrative detention and a conviction whose basis was very unclear, for much of the period since April 2015. I understand that she is a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is an outlawed group in Israel and considered a terrorist group by the EU.  However, no real and credible imputation of personal involvement in violent activities has been made against her.</p>  <p>  My view on this case, and on the practice of administrative detention generally, is very clear.  While no-one can doubt the particular threats and security concerns which Israel faces, administrative detention should only be used, if at all, in the most serious of cases and in the face of serious and immediate threat.  In all other cases, persons should be charged and tried in the courts, able to hear and challenge the evidence against them.  No evidence of such a serious and immediate threat has been presented, in a way which would allow the person in question to address it, in this case. </p>  <p>  In general, there is serious concern that administrative detention is being applied on an increasingly routine basis against people who are politically active and critical of the occupation of the Palestinian territory, without any evidence being made available to indicate that these individuals constitute a security threat.  Such periods of detention are often rolled over and extended indefinitely. </p>  <p>  All of these criticisms have been conveyed to the Israeli authorities, most recently in the context of the Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the Human Rights Council in January of this year, when Ireland reiterated that detainees must have the right to be informed of the charges underlying any detention, have access to legal assistance, and receive a fair trial. Ireland has also been instrumental in having them included in EU Council Conclusions on the situation in Israel and Palestine.</p>  <p>  It is incumbent on Israel to charge this person with credible and evidence-based offences, or to release her.  I note that a leading article in one of the main Israeli newspapers this week made the same call.</p></reply>

The IDPRTG is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives from the Department as well as from the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, the Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection, Revenue and the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  Action 3.13 of the Roadmap provides for a review of the cost of funded supplementary pensions to the Exchequer in the context of the development of a new auto-enrolment scheme. </p>  <p>  The State encourages individuals to save for retirement by offering tax incentives when saving for a pension, and marginal tax relief is considered to be a material incentive to encourage such savings. The income draw-down phase is taxed and, to a degree, tax relief on pensions represents a deferral of taxation. Though public sector schemes generally operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, contributions made by public sector employees and pension benefits received by public sector employees are subject to applicable tax laws. </p>  <p>  The IDPRTG is currently considering a number of action points that were identified in the Government's Roadmap.  As part of its consideration, it will be important to canvass the views of interested parties and with this in mind my Department is planning to shortly launch a public consultation process.  Taking account of the need to give time to elicit the various external views and to then consider the submissions made, my Department is currently planning to report on these matters by the end of the year.&rdquo;</p></reply>

However, increasing the availability of data in relation to Employer and Public Liability Insurance is a matter which was discussed by the Cost of Insurance Working Group and its <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>(2018) recommends a number of actions to improve transparency in this area. </p><p>Among these, Recommendation 1 requires the Central Statistics Office to consider the feasibility of collecting price information on the cost of insurance to businesses with this exercise to commence by the end of Q2 2018.  My officials have been informed by the CSO that this review commenced in May.  They have been advised that this work will involve the following steps:</p><p>- Researching the methodological approach including contacting other countries that already compile such an index;</p><p>- Meeting with each of the relevant insurance companies to explain the data requirements for the creation of such an index;</p><p>- Requesting sample data (retrospective) from the companies;</p><p>- Compiling the index based on the sample data and testing the index for plausibility, accuracy and quality; and</p><p>- Writing up the conclusions of the research into the feasibility report</p><p>In addition, the CSO has stated that there will be significant methodological and practical challenges that will need to be overcome in order to produce a price index for business insurance.  From a practical point of view, the new survey if deemed feasible, will have to be completed on a voluntary basis as there are no legal instruments in place to compel insurance companies to respond to data requests.  It should also be noted that from a methodological point of view, the market for business insurance is far more heterogeneous compared to the relatively homogeneous market for motor insurance.  This creates difficulties when trying to decide on the product or service which must be tracked consistently over time.  You should also be aware that it would not be usual to publish a price index with just a couple of data points so a number of months of data would need to be compiled before publication of any price data for such premiums.</p><p>The complexity of this project was factored into the timeline of the action plan and consequently the CSO is scheduled to deliver its feasibility report by Q4 2018.  If it concludes that such an index is possible to produce, then the implementation process will begin in such a way that allows the collection of the necessary data to be done in a credible and effective way.</p><p>In parallel with the CSO&rsquo;s feasibility study, Recommendation 4 of the <i>Report </i>provides that the Department of Finance should publish a key information report on Employer and Public Liability insurance claims by the end of this year. In this regard, my Department has written to Insurance Ireland requesting that the necessary data is supplied to the Department in good time so that the Department can produce the planned report within the agreed timeline.</p></reply>

However, I think it is important to note that extensive work is underway to try and mitigate these risks as much as possible.  </p>  <p>  In the context of contingency planning, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) in the UK are engaged in dialogue with firms including insurers who will be impacted by Brexit.  In this context, it is important to note that not all firms will be effected in the same way.  The Central Bank is also monitoring the implementation of plans by UK insurers, which includes several UK firms applying to set up subsidiaries or third-country branches in Ireland, as well as other applying in other EU27 countries.  It should be noted that Irish authorised firms selling into the UK are also implementing Brexit mitigation plans using similar approaches.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the European regulatory system is formulating the supervisory guidance on the many issues raised by Brexit and the Central Bank of Ireland from an insurance perspective is involved in this process through our participation in EIOPA.  In particular, I understand that the Central Bank is a member of the EIOPA Brexit Platform, which provides a forum for regulators to exchange information about firms&rsquo; plans.</p>  <p>  While many firms are moving forward with Brexit preparation plans, the final impact of Brexit on insurers will depend on the outcome of the EU27-UK negotiations, with the nature and duration of transition arrangements an important factor in determining the speed of adjustment. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s preparation and contingency work is ongoing and continues to examine all possible scenarios and challenges, and is a key input into the whole of Government approach. As part of its contingency planning, the Department is engaged on an ongoing basis in examining the potential impacts of Brexit on the financial services sector including insurance and potential mitigants.  As part of this work the Department liaises with other Government Departments and Agencies who have responsibilities in this area, including Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The Department also engages closely with the Central Bank of Ireland which has the statutory responsibility for financial stability.  Engagement with the Central Bank also takes place via the Financial Stability Group where Brexit is a standing item on the Group&rsquo;s agenda.</p></reply>

The Bank provided a comprehensive update on the Tracker Mortgage Examination in April 2018, which is available at: .</p><p>The April update report indicated that: </p><p>- the total number of customers identified through the Examination to end-March 2018 is c. 30,000 (of which 1,500 remain to be verified by lenders), which therefore brings the total number of impacted tracker customers to 37,100 (inclusive of the 7,100 impacted cases identified before the commencement of the industry wide examination);  </p><p>- 88% of identified and verified customer accounts from the Examination have received offers of redress and compensation.

At this juncture, as highlighted in the last update report, it is anticipated that the action points likely to be delayed beyond 2018 are those related to the large-scale initiatives under the remit of the Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport. These include the completion of the Master Licence Record project and the database to identify uninsured drivers.  However, it is expected that the vast majority of the Action Plan will be completed by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  For more information on the status of each individual recommendation, including the envisaged timeframes for completion, I refer the Deputy to the quarterly update reports.  Both the Report and all of the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for May 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.  While it is accepted that motor insurance premiums are still at a very high level for many people, such statistics indicate at least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis.  I am hopeful that this trend in pricing will be maintained and that premiums shall continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p></reply>

Such income could therefore be liable, inter alia, to income tax at the standard or higher rates, to corporation tax at the trading or passive rates or as franked investment income, or to the deemed disposal and exit tax provisions relevant to funds.</p>  <p>  It is therefore not possible to provide estimates of the tax cost/yield of the measures described by the Deputy.  However if the Deputy would like to request information in relation to a change in the taxation of a particular subset of dividend type, or of dividend recipient, my officials will be happy to examine the question further. </p></reply>

This included rent paid for flats, apartments or houses. It did not include rent paid to local authorities. The credit was only available to persons renting on 7 December 2010. This tax credit ceased to be available after 31 December 2017.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that, as the rent relief tax credit is in the process of being phased out (only back claims can now be processed), and no new claimants have qualified for the relief since 2010, tax returns do not provide a reliable basis for Revenue to accurately predict either the numbers of tenants that could be eligible to claim a rent credit were it to be re-introduced post 2017 for all tenants, or the degree to which potential claimants could absorb the full amount of the credit. </p><p>Therefore, there is no reliable basis available to Revenue on which to estimate the potential cost of a rental tax credit reintroduction.</p><p>It may be of assistance to the Deputy to note that, according to Census 2016 data, the private rented sector amounts to approximately 310,000 units (for comparison, in 2010 the rent relief tax credit cost &euro;82.8 million in respect of 189,000 claimants). However, all of the individuals recorded on the Census as renting these 310,000 units may not qualify for rent relief tax credit or be able to absorb the relief in full if it were available.</p><p>Regarding the Deputy's question on the estimated cost of introducing a new affordable housing tax credit, whereby landlords would not have to pay tax on rental income for properties let over a five year period at affordable levels, Revenue have informed me there is not sufficient information available to provide an estimate.</p><p>In order to cost such a measure, the number of potential landlords eligible would have to be identified and a definition of &lsquo;affordable levels of rent&rsquo; provided.</p></reply>

This legislation set the minimum pension age at age 65 for most public servants, including teachers, appointed for the first time on or after 1 April 2004 and for those who returned to public service employment on or after that date following a break of more than 26 weeks in their public service employment.  In addition the legislation removed the compulsory retirement age for persons covered by it. Following the enactment of the legislation in 2004 a detailed circular was issued to the Management Authorities of schools on this matter by my Department.  A return to public service employment directly from a period of approved leave of absence paid or unpaid or other statutory leave does not constitute a break in service for the purposes of the Act.</p>  <p>  Based on the information provided by the Deputy, it appears that the person in question  commenced public service employment as a teacher in 2000 when the minimum pension age was age 60, although teachers could also retire on pension on reaching age 55 years having completed 35 years of reckonable teaching. However, the person left his/her public service position in 2006 and a period of more than 26 weeks elapsed before his/her return to teaching. While the change in legislation had occurred some years prior to leaving, it was on return to teaching in 2008 that his/her superannuation terms were governed by the provisions of the 2004 Act. Although the 2004 Act changed the minimum age at which pension may be paid the method of calculation of pension benefits remains the same as that which applied when the person first commenced teaching in 2000.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels. This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total)</p>  <p>  Circular 63/2017 was issued by my Department in September 2017 which sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools.  Flexibility in identifying and prioritising the evolving leadership and management needs of the school, and in assigning and re-assigning post holders to specific roles and responsibilities to meet the evolving needs of a school, is an essential feature of this school leadership model.</p>  <p>  While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school. The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.</p>  <p>  In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school. These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.</p>  <p>  The selection and recruitment process is well under way in most of our primary schools and the majority of these new middle management posts will be filled in the current school year, including schools where the Principal is a "Teaching Principal".</p>  <p>  I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year. This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Allocation section of my Department are currently processing these applications and schools are being notified as the cluster posts are approved. </p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector. </p></reply>

Restoring the railings is a significant and complex task requiring specialist conservation and iron-working expertise. The Courts Service does not have this expertise itself and is reliant on OPW resources to undertake and manage the task on its behalf.</p>  <p>  The restoration work will be undertaken in phases. The first phase of the restoration will see 10 sections repaired and will be subject to a competitive OPW tendering process. A great deal of background work has been undertaken by the OPW to date including technical appraisals, experimental repairs, exploratory works and specification of repair methodologies.  The OPW is at present finalizing the tender documentation for the restoration of the initial 10 sections. Subject to a satisfactory tender process it is anticipated that work will commence during the Autumn. The cost of restoring the initial 10 sections will be determined by the tendering process however the Courts Service has approved funding to cover this anticipated cost.</p>  <p>  The first phase will inform how future phases of the project can be undertaken and will give an indication of the likely cost of restoring all sections of railings. It is anticipated that restoring all sections will take a number of years.</p></reply>

Part 3 is the core of the personal insolvency legislation, dealing with the operation in practice of the three personal insolvency mechanisms &ndash; Debt Relief Notices, Debt Settlement Arrangements, and Personal Insolvency Arrangements. This review also responds to the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to review personal insolvency thresholds and processes, including for small to medium enterprises.</p>  <p>  In practice, the insolvency legislation has already been extensively reviewed and developed since 2012. Key reforms already introduced include the section 115A court review process (which removed the so-called &lsquo;bank veto&rsquo;) and the Abhaile Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (which in effect ensures that borrowers at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears can access free independent expert financial and legal advice to get solutions into place).  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we have always said that we will keep this important legislation under review, and will take any further action needed to ensure that it operates effectively.   </p>  <p>  My officials have completed extensive work on the review, which included a public consultation launched last year. A range of detailed submissions was received and these have been carefully analysed.  Furthermore, a number of additional issues and concerns emerged in recent months, following the closing date for the receipt of submissions. In light of these emerging issues, the timeframe for the review was extended to allow these to be taken into account. </p>  <p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland was among the organisations that made a submission to the public consultation. Given the ISI&rsquo;s statutory role in monitoring the personal insolvency system and advising me on matters related to their functions, their suggestions are particularly important for the purposes of the review. Their submission highlighted a variety of areas where the ISI believes that legislative amendments may be beneficial. These suggestions are being considered as part of the review. Subsequent discussions with the ISI have also highlighted additional possible changes to the Personal Insolvency Act. </p>  <p>  The Consultative Forum, which was established by the ISI and consists of a variety of stakeholders involved in the personal insolvency context including both debtor and creditor representatives, also made a submission to the review. This submission reveals a strong level of consensus amongst both debtors and creditors in relation to streamlining the personal insolvency process. In addition, the submissions received have suggested measures to extend access to personal insolvency options to a wider cohort of borrower and to encourage more constructive engagement with the legislation by both creditors and debtors so that the agreement of sustainable statutory personal insolvency options can be accelerated. All of these recommendations are under consideration. </p>  <p>  I expect to receive a report from my officials on the review in the coming weeks. In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I expect shortly afterwards to bring proposals to Government to address the review&rsquo;s recommendations, including proposals for legislative change.</p></reply>

To support this, Budget 2018 included provision of &euro;28.6m for Garda Reform to support the continued provision of policing services in 2018 as well as the implementation of Garda reform including resources for the Policing Authority. Predominantly, this allocation will support the recruitment of up to a further 500 civilian staff and 800 trainee Garda&iacute; this year. Further significant funding to support the reform programme is embedded across the overall Garda budget of approximately &euro;1.65 billion for 2018.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 2,400 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis for the years 2018 to 2021. Already in 2018, 400 new recruits have entered the Garda College and a further 400 will begin their training before the end of the year. This recruitment is in addition to the just under 2,000 new recruits who have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including 404 attestations in 2018, and who have been assigned to mainstream duties around the country  since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. It is anticipated that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, at year end will amount to approximately 14,000.</p>  <p>  Civilianisation is a key element of the reform programme that is being pursued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians. Real, tangible progress is being made in relation to civilianisation. To date under the reform programme, 292 new civilian positions have been sanctioned, the bulk of which were to address critical skills gaps and capacity issues with a proportion sanctioned to make a start on the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties. I am informed by the Commissioner that there were 2,289 civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as of 30 April 2018. </p>  <p>  This target of 4,000 civilians by 2021 will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect with the backfilling of these roles by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  The Garda Inspectorate identified some 1,500 posts held by Garda&iacute; that could be examined for suitability for civilian staff.</p></reply>

Member States were required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive by 25 May 2018.</p>  <p>  The Directive requires carriers to provide Member States&rsquo; authorities with PNR data in respect of flights entering or departing the EU (known as extra-EU flights). The Directive provides that Member States may, on a non-mandatory basis, require carriers to collect PNR data in respect of flights operating within the EU (intra-EU flights).  The Directive requires each Member State to establish a Passenger Information Unit (PIU) which will receive the PNR data from carriers and exchange data and processing results with other Member States and with Europol.  </p>  <p>  The PNR Directive has been transposed into Irish law with effect from 25 May by the EU (PNR Data) Regulations 2018. As a result, the Irish PIU has been formally established and the processing of passenger data has commenced. Passenger screening using PNR data is being introduced on a phased basis. Firstly, the non-discretionary aspects of the Directive (i.e., screening extra EU flights) have been transposed by way of the Regulations referred to above.  Secondly, primary legislation will be introduced in due course to provide for screening intra EU flights. </p>  <p>  Up to 31 May 2018, circa &euro;200,000 has been expended in relation to the IPIU, primarily in relation to office equipment, office premises and establishment and configuration of ICT systems.  In addition, a Principal Officer and two Assistant Principals Officers have been assigned to the unit. It is too early at this stage to provide accurate end of year out-turn expenditure figures.

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015.  </p><p>New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017.</p><p>The Director is working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations.  Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.</p><p>The Mental Health Commission has recently engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service.  The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework.</p><p>The 2018 Budget provided for an allocation of &euro;3 million for the Decision Support Service in a new subhead D. 10 of the Justice and Equality Vote.  Funds from this subhead are released by my Department to the Mental Health Commission on foot of written drawdown requests from the MHC.</p><p>I am advised by the Mental Health Commission that &euro;242,934 has been spent on the establishment of the Decision Support Service so far in 2018, with further expenditure of &euro;149,004 expected before the end of June, which comes to a total amount of &euro;391,938 by end-June.  This can be broken down as follows:</p><p>Staff costs: &euro;116,314</p><p>Rent: &euro;91,668</p><p>General expenses: &euro;3,571</p><p>Legal, finance and compliance: &euro;17,733</p><p>Project management/Business advisory: &euro;161,976</p><p>ICT: &euro;676</p><p>As the plans towards the establishment of the Decision Support Service progress during the rest of the year and additional full-time staff are recruited, it is expected that the expenditure rate will accelerate significantly.</p></reply>

Overseas selection missions in collaboration with the UNHCR.</p><p>2. Placement of refugees in Emergency Response and Orientation Centres (EROCs) for the purposes of acclimatisation, orientation, etc.</p><p>3. Settlement in communities in local authority areas, coordinated by an inter-agency working group chaired by the relevant local authority, with refugees supported by an &quot;implementing partner&quot; procured by the local authority.  The funding for the implementing partner is provided by the IRPP and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), both under the auspices of my Department.  Local Authorities play a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through the procuring of a suitable implementing partner with expertise in community integration and relevant supports.</p><p>The implementation of the resettlement programme requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE, Tusla and Local Authorities are represented on the national Taskforce which oversees delivery of the programme.  The programme is coordinated overall by the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) but service provision remains the responsibility of the relevant statutory entity. </p><p>Once resettled, the implementing partner provides appropriate services for a period of twelve to eighteen months to assist with integration.  The standard model is now focussed on an eighteen month period.</p><p>The following tables show the position in the counties in which resettlement programmes are underway.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the numbers reflect the fact that the programme is a work in progress, with further resettlements planned and personnel yet to be recruited.  Some counties will be resettling further refugees as their overall allocation is higher than their initial allocation. </p><p><b>Persons Included in the Resettlement Programme:</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Initial Agreed Allocation</th><th>Persons Resettled </th></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>90</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>100</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>120</td><td>116</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>100</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>100</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>120</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>50</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>60</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>80</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>90</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>99</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>140</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>140</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>150</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>210</td><td>196</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>160</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>90</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>100 </td><td>93</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Staffing Levels:</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Resettlement   Workers:<br /><br />Agreed   Number</th><th>Resettlement   Workers<br /><br />Employed</th><th>Intercultural<br /><br />Support   Workers: Agreed Number</th><th>Intercultural<br /><br />Support   Workers: Employed</th></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are actively supporting their clients to achieve this. My Department provided for additional monies in 2017 to enable EI and the LEOs to ramp up supports in light of Brexit to drive improvements in: </p>  <p>  - productivity, </p>  <p>  - innovation, </p>  <p>  - management capability and leadership skills.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has launched several initiatives in response to Brexit, including:</p>  <p>  - Brexit Scorecard: This interactive online platform can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars. Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit.</p>  <p>  - Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SMEs a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit. The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan.</p>  <p>  - Brexit Advisory Clinics: Enterprise Ireland held four Brexit Advisory Clinics over the past few months in Portlaoise, Mayo, Cavan, Cork and today in Dublin&rsquo;s Aviva Stadium. The purpose of these Clinics is to support companies affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure. </p>  <p>  - Brexit 'Act On' Programme: This funding is to support the engagement of a consultant to draw up a report with tailored recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and become more resilient.</p>  <p>  In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on global and sectoral opportunities, further developing in-market expertise and networks, placing greater focus on identifying new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns. In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020. </p>  <p>  The 31 LEOs nationwide are assisting clients with a suite of supports which includes</p>  <p>  information, training and mentoring on Brexit related issues as well as advice on other sources of support.</p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI), has also been very active in assisting businesses address the challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce. A series of information and awareness raising events have been underway in towns across both North and South over recent months. ITI is also rolling out a &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues. </p>  <p>  Other initiatives that my Department are advancing include the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms. I recently launched the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is aimed at supporting the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  Twenty-one successful applicants representing all regions of the country have secured up to &euro;30.5m for their projects in the first competitive call.</p>  <p>  The work of my Department is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future, therefore I feel that all our efforts will put Ireland in a strong position in the event of a hard Brexit scenario. </p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs process has worked well to achieve its primary objective. Since the first Plan was launched in early 2012, there are over 345,000 more people at work. The unemployment rate has fallen from a high of 16 per cent to 5.8 per cent in May 2018.</p><p>The four key aims of Action Plan for Jobs 2018 are that: </p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base remains successful amid the uncertainty created by Brexit; </p><p>- all parts of the country achieve their potential in terms of job creation; </p><p>- those entering, re-entering, or in the workforce have the incentives and skills needed to prosper; and </p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base remains successful by focusing relentlessly on competitiveness, productivity, and innovation.</p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs 2018 reflects the Enterprise 2025 Renewed priorities and also the priorities within other Government strategies that are relevant to job creation, including for people with disabilities, e.g. Pathways to Work Strategy and the Action Plan for Education. Pathways to Work is the main Government initiative encouraging access to the labour market and ultimately participation in employment. It is complemented by the Action Plan for Jobless Households, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. </p><p>Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2018, there is a focus on increasing participation in the labour market, including assisting access to work for those who wish to do so, by ensuring they have opportunity to address real or perceived skills deficiencies, whether they are discouraged workers or people with disabilities.</p><p>Specific measures in Action Plan for Jobs 2018 include implementing the Pathways to Work Strategy, increasing awareness among employers of the range of services and supports available to maximise take up, and improving information flow on welfare-to-work schemes, targeting employers and inactive people.  </p><p>There is also a specific action to increase the focus of activation efforts on groups outside the labour force, by: </p><p>- reviewing the range of income supports (including in-work supports) for people with disabilities to ensure payments are aligned between schemes and, if appropriate, amend the payment structure to ensure that it supports a return to work for people who wish to do so;  </p><p>- expanding the use of Intreo Centres as a gateway to engage with people with disabilities and increase the number of Intreo staff trained in the provision of employment supports to people with disability; and </p><p>- developing online ready-reckoner tools for people on disability payments to assess the net benefits of returning to work.</p></reply>

Concrete measures to achieve these targets are outlined. </p>  <p>- Strand 3 will ensure that gender perspectives are integrated into the research content of SFI funded research programmes.</p>  <p>  In 2017, SFI achieved its Agenda 2020 target of making 25% of its awards to female researchers and this target has now been revised upward to 30%.  This target has been aided by SFI providing incentives for research bodies to submit applications from female researchers to various programmes, with a focus on those aligned with early career stage.</p>  <p>  The SFI Research Outputs Census 2017 shows that the percentage of female SFI Award Holders Active in 2017 was 28%, up on 25% in 2016 and 21% in 2015.  The percentage of female team members (those employed on SFI awards) was 37%, an increase on 35% in 2016, which represents progress towards redressing gender imbalance.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, award holders&rsquo; success rates (2016) shows that female researchers are as competitive as their male counterparts in terms of their SFI funding success rate i.e., 32% across all programmes.  However, female researchers within the same cohort (2016) accounted for only 25% of SFI funding applications received.</p>  <p>  SFI is also supportive of the Athena SWAN Charter which is the internationally recognised &lsquo;quality mark&rsquo; for gender equality.  It was established to encourage and recognise commitment to advancing the careers of women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine.</p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland continues to implement specific grant management policies to deal with the needs of female researchers during periods of maternity and adoptive leave, and will continue to innovate in this regard. The policies being developed and associated outcomes will complement and support the Athena SWAN initiative, whereby the Irish Research Council, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health Research Board will require research bodies to have attained a bronze institutional Athena SWAN award by the end of 2019 and a silver institutional Athena SWAN by the end of 2023, to be eligible for research funding.</p>  <p>  In further recognition of the Athena SWAN initiative, Science Foundation Ireland has, under the Starting Investigator Research Grant (SIRG) programme set criteria around addressing gender imbalance. SIRG aims to support excellent postdoctoral researchers and others who are yet to hold an independent research post in taking the initial steps towards a fully independent research career.  Research Bodies are permitted to put forward a maximum of 12 candidates.  A maximum of six candidates, out of the 12 permitted from each eligible research body, may be male candidates.</p>  <p>  Another aspect of Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s Gender Strategy is to ensure that gender is integrated as a perspective in all the research Science Foundation Ireland funds, when this is relevant. While this approach was launched for some programmes during 2017, applicants will in future be required to provide a statement articulating the sex/gender variables in their research and will include guidance for applicants and a request for comment from the reviewers.</p>  <p>  Finally, further rollout of gender redressing initiatives amongst SFI award holders will include those to address gender imbalance in senior academic roles.  Specifically, in order to encourage more applications from excellent female researchers to the SFI Research Professorship Programme, SFI is mandating that for all institutions wishing to nominate candidates to the programme, one of the next two successful Expressions of Interest (i.e., approved by SFI) must be associated with a female candidate, which must then be followed up with the submission of a Full Proposal.</p>  <p>  The above detail shows that SFI is proactive in bringing about a sea change on gender equality matters in the field of research and development and I am confident that the initiatives employed by SFI to date will continue to bring further successes in the future.</p></reply>

This means that if an employer is unsuccessful in filling a vacancy either domestically or from across the European Economic Area (EEA) it can be filled by a suitably qualified non- EEA national.</p><p>The changes to the Employment Permit Regulations, which came into effect from 26<sup>th</sup>March 2018, involved removing the following chef grades from the ineligible list:  </p><p>- Executive Chef with minimum of 5 years&rsquo; experience at that level </p><p>- Head Chef with minimum of 5 years&rsquo; experience at that level </p><p>- Sous Chef with minimum of 5 years&rsquo; experience at that level </p><p>- Chef de Partie with minimum of 2 years&rsquo; experience at that level</p><p>My decision to remove certain chef grades from the ineligible lists will ensure that there is a mechanism to address the shortage of qualified chefs in the short-term. I have applied a quota of 610 employment permits to ensure that in the longer term the demand for chefs is met from a steady supply in the Irish labour market and to that end I am aware of the work that is underway to increase the supply of chefs through training initiatives such as the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship and a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.</p><p>An Interdepartmental Group (IDG), chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, is currently reviewing the economic migration policies underpinning the employment permits system, the purpose of which is to ensure that current policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.  A full report with recommendations on a framework for the future operation of the employment permits regime is due by the end of June.</p></reply>

However, it is worth noting that despite the change in our ranking in this EY survey, the most recent Institute for Management Development (IMD) survey states that Ireland is the 12th most competitive economy in the world and the 3rd most competitive economy in the Euro area.  This is still a significant achievement especially when you consider that the UK is ranked 20th. The World Bank&rsquo;s 2017 Ease of Doing Business Report shows Ireland is ranked 17th,   an improvement of one place from the previous year.</p>  <p>  It is also important to remember that a real indication of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness is the increase in employment across sectors and regions. In this regard, the impressive performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is to be commended. </p>  <p>  The IDA has made significant progress in diversifying their portfolio of client companies and the overseas markets that offer sources of investments here.  There were 111 new name investments in 2017, an increase of 12% compared to 2016 which saw 99 new name investments. </p>  <p>  The Government is nevertheless conscious of our need to remain as competitive as possible. We cannot become complacent in relation to the hard-won gains of recent years. I will be working hard with my colleagues across Government, in collaboration with the IDA, to help ensure that Ireland remains a competitive destination for FDI.</p></reply>

As we draw closer to full employment, it is essential that enterprise in Ireland has access to high-quality, adaptable and flexible talent pools. Enhancing female participation has the potential to address the growing need for skills and talent and to deliver significant social and gender equality benefits. With this in mind, I have included an action in the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 relevant to female participation. Action 28 aims to &lsquo;identify relevant policy issues for cohorts with low participation rates based on patterns of labour market participation&rsquo;. My Department has lead responsibility on this action and is currently working with several other Government departments to ensure the completion of this action in the second half of the year.</p>  <p>  Policy responsibility for participation falls across several government Departments. A number of measures are underway to facilitate female participation in the labour market. It is clear that to make greater female participation a reality, barriers to entering/re-entering the labour market must be addressed. In recent years, several initiatives have been launched to facilitate the return of women to employment. These include: </p>  <p>  - Action 27 in the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 relates to the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme. Access to affordable childcare is often identified as a barrier to women&rsquo;s labour market participation in Ireland. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs have responsibility for the continued implementation of reforms to existing schemes and progressing the Affordable Childcare Scheme. The deadline for this action is also for the latter half of this year. </p>  <p>  - The Department of Justice and Equality introduced the &lsquo;Women Returning to the Workforce Initiative&rsquo; in 2017. The supports range from confidence building, career guidance and support in completing applications, to training programmes and work placements. </p>  <p>  - The Department of Justice and Equality launched the &lsquo;National Strategy for Women and Girls&rsquo; in 2017.  This strategy focuses on the needs of working women by proposing to continue to increase investment in childcare, to take action to tackle the gender pay gap, to improve the conditions of women in precarious employment and to provide additional help to women entrepreneurs. </p>  <p>  - The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection implements the &lsquo;Pathways to Work Programme&rsquo; which aims to increase active labour market participation by people (including lone parents and people with disabilities) of a working age so as to help ensure a supply of labour at competitive rates and to minimise welfare dependency. This strategy includes specific actions to increase labour market participation and employment progression of people who are not currently active in the labour market and to apply the concept of active inclusion as a guiding principle &ndash; particularly from 2018-2020. </p>  <p>  - Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) aims to play a strong role in addressing gender imbalance in science by committing to increase the representation of women among SFI award holders to 30% by 2020 and to improve the representation and progression of women in all aspects of STEM careers in Ireland. Through its Starting Investigator Research Grant (SIRG) programme, SFI has piloted an initiative to encourage increased applications from female researchers. This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of SIRG applications from and SIRG awards to women. </p>  <p>  - Industry have also initiated programmes to attract women back to the workforce. &lsquo;Women ReBoot&rsquo; is a programme led by Technology Ireland and Skillnets (which is funded through the National Training Fund through the </p>  <p>  Department of Education and Skills and private industry). The programme aims to redress the gender imbalance in tech by attracting women with STEM experience back to the sector. This is delivered through a mix of coaching, online learning, networking skills and work placements in leading tech companies. Women ReBoot has been highly successful in helping participants secure employment.</p></reply>

The WRC and the Labour Court are independent statutory bodies and conduct their quasi-judicial functions independently and as Minister, I have no role in this regard.</p>  <p>  As the deputy points out, this dispute was before the Labour Court earlier this year and in April, the Labour Court issued a recommendation urging the parties to engage with each other in order to seek agreement in relation to the matters at issue. In its recommendation, the Labour Court indicated also that if, following such engagement, matters remained unresolved, the parties should avail of the services of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Court in furthering efforts to secure resolution. </p>  <p>  As Minister, I would encourage both parties to engage constructively with each other on the issues in dispute and to avail of the services of the WRC and the Labour Court which stand ready to assist in the resolution of disputes to reach a resolution by agreement. This will lead to a positive outcome for the company, its employees and the customers that it serves.</p></reply>

Cavan. </p>  <p>  The North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region. The core objective of the Action Plan is to increase employment in the region by 10-15%, resulting in the delivery of 28,000 jobs by 2020. We are aiming to ensure the unemployment rate is within the 1% of the State average. </p>  <p>  Some 12,000 jobs were created in the Border region since the regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative was launched in January 2015 while the unemployment rate in the Border region has fallen since then and now stands at 4.9% according to the CSO (Q4 2017).</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Live Register numbers continue to fall in County Cavan, down from 7,793 in July 2012 to 3,655 in May 2018, a decrease of over 4,000. There is of course always room for improvement but the latest CSO figures are testament to the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help create jobs and reduce unemployment.</p>  <p>  I recently launched the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is aimed at supporting the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  I would encourage all entities, including in the Cavan region, to use this fund to support job creation. The closing date is 3pm on Thursday 28th  June.</p>  <p>  Twenty-one successful applicants representing all regions of the country have secured up to &euro;30.5m for their projects in the first competitive call. Cavan County Council and LEO Cavan were successful in acquiring funding as part of the Upper Shannon Erne Future Economy Project under the first Enterprise Ireland Regional Enterprise Development Fund call, for the development of a Digital Hub Facility in Cavan.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) together with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) play a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets. In 2017, EI paid &euro;2.5m to companies in Cavan.</p>  <p>  Total employment in EI supported companies in Co. Cavan now stands at 5,451, an increase of 28% since 2012. In May, EI facilitated a meeting of LEO and EI engineering companies from Cavan, Louth and Meath with a view to creating an engineering cluster in the region.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Cavan serves as the first stop shop to provide strategic, technical and financial supports and services to start, grow and develop small businesses in each county.</p>  <p>  Some specific supports LEO Cavan provides for the development of existing indigenous businesses include the LEAN for Micro programme, Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Exporters and the Co-Innovate Programme. In July 2018, LEO Cavan is delivering a number of workshops and information seminars to assist local businesses with accessing these supports and guiding them towards growing their businesses by exploring export markets, trading online opportunities, innovation projects, cross border research and development collaborations and trade partnerships.</p>  <p>  Last year LEO Cavan created 207 new jobs. They provided training to 1,293 clients and mentoring to 91 clients.</p>  <p>  Regarding foreign investment, Cavan has seven multinational companies employing 1,555 people. The county maintains an impressive base of FDI with companies such as CG Power Systems, Wellman International and Gyproc St. Gobain. We are making significant progress towards achieving our regional development targets, which include a 30% to 40% increase in FDI in the North-East Region by 2019.</p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to Brexit, my Department and its agencies are carrying out extensive work to prepare for all eventualities. I was delighted to attend and speak at the Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Clinic in Cootehill, Cavan in March of this year. These clinics provide the opportunity for companies that may be affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure.</p></reply>

Cavan as part of its North-East region, together with Louth and Monaghan. There are currently seven multinational companies in Cavan employing a total of 1,155 people.</p>  <p>  The IDA Ireland business and technology park in Killygarry, Co. Cavan covers approximately 17 hectares.  Of this, around 11 hectares are currently available for marketing.  The main tenant on the park is ATA Group, which is an Enterprise Ireland client company. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is actively marketing the park to both existing and prospective clients as a location for overseas investment.  The Agency will also consider opportunities to utilise the Park to attract other, less traditional investments into this location. These are investments which don&rsquo;t fall under the general remit of IDA or Enterprise Ireland but which could create investment and employment opportunities in Cavan. </p>  <p>  The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East/North West Region and has an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre.  As part of its strategy to encourage investment to the area the Agency is focusing on sectors including agri-food, manufacturing, tourism, internationally traded services. The IDA also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan including local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. </p>  <p>  Attracting FDI to regional areas is not without its challenges. That&rsquo;s largely because there is a global trend to base FDI around large urban areas. Quite often companies also want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises. As a result, it&rsquo;s unavoidable that some businesses are intent in investing in larger urban areas. That sometimes is just a commercial reality. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless I recognise that there is room for improvement in Cavan and we are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of the area. The Enterprise Agencies remain pivotal to this and they continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment for the region.</p></reply>

This agreement applies to 10 lead cases that were before the High Court and other cases that involved the same contract and other eligible consultants who had not initiated cases. </p>  <p>  The settlement terms achieved represent a substantial reduction on previous estimates of potential liability of up to &euro;700 million. Under the terms of the settlement, it has been agreed to correct the pay rate only for those Consultants who signed &lsquo;Consultant Contract 2008&rsquo; between 25 July 2008 and 30 September 2012. Correction of remuneration/pension entitlements will be effective from the &lsquo;Date of Settlement' (15 June) but payable from January 2019. </p>  <p>  The total cost of retrospective payments (&ldquo;arrears&rdquo;) under the agreement is estimated at &euro;182 million. The additional cost of correcting the pay rates is approximately &euro;62 million per year backdated to the &lsquo;Date of Settlement&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Payments of arrears will be phased over 2019 and 2020, as follows:</p>  <p>  - 40% (&euro;73 million) payable on or before 01 June 2019, and </p>  <p>  - 60% (&euro;109 million) payable on or before 01 March 2020.</p>  <p>  The impact of the settlement on the fiscal space for 2019 is a matter for the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  While this settlement is costly it is the most cost-effective outcome for the Exchequer and the taxpayer resulting in significant savings and prevents a lengthy and costly legal battle. This settlement brings to conclusion a disagreement between the parties that has been ongoing since 2009 and I look forward to a reinvigorated working relationship with consultants.</p></reply>

This agreement applies to 10 lead cases that were before the High Court and other cases that involved the same contract. This case was due to commence on 05 June 2018 however both agreed to an adjournment to facilitate settlement discussions.</p>  <p>  The settlement terms achieved represent a substantial reduction on previous estimates of potential liability of up to &euro;700 million. Under the terms of the settlement, it has been agreed to correct the pay rate only for those Consultants who signed &lsquo;Consultant Contract 2008&rsquo; between 25 July 2008 and 30th September 2012. Correction of remuneration/pension entitlements will be effective from the Date of Settlement (15 June) but payable from January 2019. </p>  <p>  Under the Settlement an eligible Consultant shall be entitled to retrospective payment (&ldquo;arrears&rdquo;) of remuneration and/or retrospective payment of pension entitlements as follows:</p>  <p>  - For consultants who have initiated proceedings against the State: for a period commencing up to six years prior to the date of issue of proceedings and ending on the Date of Settlement.</p>  <p>  - For non-litigating consultants: for a period of up to six years prior to the Date of Settlement and ending on the Date of Settlement.</p>  <p>  Any retrospective payment will be calculated as 55% of the difference between the remuneration paid to a Consultant during the period of retrospection and the remuneration which he or she would have been paid if the provisions of the Consultants&rsquo; Contract 2008 had been fully applied.</p>  <p>  The estimated costs which will arise from the settlement reached are &euro;182m for arrears, and ongoing costs of &euro;62m per annum from 2019, backdated to the date of settlement in June 2018. Payment of the arrears will be phased over 2019 and 2020. While this settlement is extremely costly it is the most cost-effective outcome for the Exchequer and the taxpayer resulting in significant savings and prevents a lengthy and costly legal battle.</p>  <p>  The IHCA and IMO have committed to recommending the agreement to members and will not support any progression of the current cases that have been initiated or any new litigation.  </p>  <p>  All consultants who accept the terms also affirm the terms of Consultant Contract 2008 and accept the importance of compliance with the terms of that Contract. The agreement confirms the commitment of the parties to compliance with contractual obligations to ensure more timely delivery of effective care to patients. It specifically provides for co-operation in relation to arrangements put in place to verify the delivery of the consultant&rsquo;s contractual commitments, in particular those relating to private practice. This is going to help in ensuring accountability, compliance with the contract by consultants and improving services to patients.</p>  <p>  This settlement brings to conclusion a disagreement between the parties that has been ongoing since 2009 and I look forward to a reinvigorated working relationship with consultants.</p></reply>

This includes medical cards, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, home care packages, counselling, disability services, medication, transport and childcare costs and other supports. </p>  <p>  Since the decision to establish the support package, a team of specially designated Liaison Officers has been appointed to work with individuals and put in place the required supports. At close of business on Thursday 14 June 2018, the Liaison Officers had contacted 203 individuals and held 143 face-to-face meetings to discuss their needs.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that every individual&rsquo;s circumstances will be unique to them and thus the HSE has taken care to respect the wishes of the women and their families regarding the timing of contacts and subsequent meetings.  Where meetings have not yet been held, this reflects the wishes of the individuals concerned either to meet at a future date that suits them or, in some instances not to take up the offer of support.</p>  <p>  To date, the HSE has issued 246 new medical cards to women and family members or next-of-kin, and has also made amendments to the terms of existing medical cards or G.P visit cards in 87 cases to re-categorise these as medical cards under the terms of the CervicalCheck support package.  A very small number of registration requests are currently on hand and liaison officers are working with clients to complete these, while any outstanding registration requests will be processed as a matter of priority as soon as they are submitted. </p>  <p>  Where women have been prescribed a medicine by their treating clinician, any out-of-pocket costs will be met. This includes medicines not officially approved for reimbursement and any other non-standard therapies, once prescribed for the patient by their doctor. </p>  <p>  Arrangements are in place to reimburse a range of costs that the women and their families incur from 11 May 2018 including travel costs, childcare costs and medical appointment costs among others.  These will be reimbursed upon receipt of claims from individuals.    </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the HSE to gather information on the type and scale of costs that individuals have incurred retrospectively, to enable a decision to be made on the most appropriate means of supporting people in this regard.  </p>  <p>  In response to a recommendation from Dr Scally's recently published progress report, I have also made available an ex gratia payment of &euro;2,000 to the women and families affected. As Dr Scally rightly states in his report, it is important that women do not encounter any financial obstacles to participating and making their voices heard in relation to the Scoping Inquiry or any subsequent Commission of Investigation. These payments will be made as quickly as possible. I am advised that the HSE aims to have all the payments processed by the end of June. </p>  <p>  This should not be considered a bar to any further payment that Government may decide to make available. It should be noted that not all of the 209 women and families to whom the package of supports has been offered has taken this up, and this may also apply in relation to the ex gratia payment. The process and all required supports will continue to be rolled out to all women directly affected.</p></reply>

Changes are common and cervical screening by smear tests can pick up early cell changes so they can be monitored or treated. The earlier abnormal cell changes are found, the easier they are to treat. Early detection and treatment of changes in the cells of the cervix can prevent cervical cancer.</p>  <p>  All women are actively encouraged to attend for cervical screening at appropriate intervals. Women aged 25 to 44 will be invited routinely for a free smear test every three years and women aged 45 to 60 will be invited routinely every five years. </p>  <p>  Women who are recommended for increased surveillance are re-called after one year following a normal smear test result.</p>  <p>  Cervical screening tests, like other screening tests, are not 100% accurate. Any women who has concerns or experiences suspicious symptoms should visit her doctor for further investigation.</p></reply>

Funding has been provided to support extension of the existing cath lab operating hours to 12 weekly sessions per week, or by 20%, as recommended in the Herity Report. The HSE has advised approval and funding has been provided for the posts required to facilitate this service expansion and recruitment is currently being progressed by local management and the HSE&rsquo;s National Recruitment Service. A mobile cath lab has been deployed since October 2017, initially for a period of 20 weeks but since extended to allow time for University Hospital Waterford to complete recruitment of the additional staff required for the service extension to the existing cath lab.</p>  <p>  The aim of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services, which has been underway since January, is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. The anticipated timeline is 18 months although the Chair will seek to expedite the submission of the Final Report if possible.</p>  <p>  As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac catheterisation laboratories and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review.</p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that I met with South East Oireachtas members on 14 February and indicated that I would give some consideration to the various issues raised by the group, including the potential for the deployment of a modular cath lab, as an interim solution, pending the outcome of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. My Department is currently examining this matter at my request and it is envisaged that this examination will be completed shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-21a.485.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062100047#WRJ00400"><p>The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to develop plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care services. The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation. For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services. It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way. The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.   </p>  <p>  As an initial step in this process, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home care systems in four other European countries. This review, which was published in April 2017, will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland. I, along with Minister Harris, also launched a public consultation process in July 2017 which closed in October 2017. The purpose of this consultation was to allow all those with views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers. There was a very high response rate to the consultation process with approximately 2,600 submissions received. I intend to publish a report of the findings of the consultation process next week.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that a significant amount of detailed work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of home care scheme and the system of regulation for these services. This is required if reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.  </p>  <p>  However, while the new home care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive (HSE) are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing services. The HSE has begun streamlining services in 2018 by bringing together the funding for home help and standard home care packages, which now operate as a single home support service. This new approach will provide significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.</p>  <p>  2018 has also seen a significant increase in the provision of home support services. The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094m home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people. This represents an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people over last year.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  </p>  <p>  The HSE will also continue to encourage local integration of services and build appropriate care pathways, in particular for people with dementia and complex needs.</p></reply>

I am aware that there has been some criticism of the Departments approving the use of private investigators as part of the defence. The use of these services is not unusual where legal proceedings are in train and where evidence is being gathered.</p>  <p>  Arising from the High Court proceedings taken against the State for alleged breach of Consultant Contract 2008, the Government made a decision to vigorously defend these cases. Examination of possible non-compliance with the terms of the plaintiff&rsquo;s contract was part of the defence strategy mounted against the plaintiffs; particularly in relation to the level of private practice undertaken. Under the 2008 Contract, consultants with certain contract types may engage in off-site private practice, others are limited to on-site private practice up to specified levels and others are not allowed engage in private practice. Of the ten lead-cases, three were subject to particular scrutiny. </p>  <p>  Gathering data in relation to off-site private practice is more difficult than on-site practice and to do so in a thorough manner required the services of a private investigator in order to establish if excessive off-site private practice work was being undertaken by the consultants and the extent of such work. The HSE instructed private investigators to gather evidence to support the HSE's counter-claim in relation to non-compliant consultants. This approach was approved by the Departments of Health, Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform and was reaffirmed by the Departments as appropriate in the lead-up to the hearing date in conjunction with the State&rsquo;s legal advisors. It should be noted that no consultants outside of the lead cases were subject to surveillance by a private investigator. </p>  <p>  The settlement agreement reached between the parties provides that by accepting the settlement, eligible consultants who settle under this agreement affirm the terms of the Consultants Contract 2008. This is a positive commitment that the HSE and the Department can use to strengthen monitoring of compliance and sends a strong signal that there is renewed commitment by all sides to ensuring adherence to public/private practice ratios as set out in the contract.</p></reply>

This more than doubled its 2017 total allocation of &euro;20m. This funding was to build on the work started in 2017 in addressing waiting times for Inpatient/Daycase (IPDC) procedures, and to create a strategy to ensure a continued downward trend in waiting times. </p>  <p>  In April 2018 I launched the Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan which outlines the combined impact of HSE and NTPF activity in 2018 to reduce the number of patients waiting for treatment to below 70,000 in 2018. This plan marks a very important milestone in delivering on this commitment.</p>  <p>  In 2018 the NTPF will outsource 20,000 inpatient day cases, while the HSE will deliver 1.14 million hospital operations or procedures. This will mean that by the end of 2018 we will expect to see a significant reduction in the number waiting for a procedure to under 70,000 - from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017.</p>  <p>  There are seven high volume procedures that are the focus of the NTPF funded treatments, specifically cataracts, hip/knee replacements, tonsils, angiograms, cystoscopies, skin lesions and varicose veins. All patients who are waiting more than 9 months and suitable for treatment at an outsourced facility will be offered treatment in 2018-for targeted high-volume procedures. For patients who are waiting longest for other procedures, the NTPF and HSE will work together to identify the requirements, develop treatment plans, and where possible offer treatments from within existing HSE and NTPF resources. </p>  <p>  In terms of treatment offers, the NTPF authorises public hospitals to offer outsourced treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. NTPF authorisations are made in respect of the longest waiting patients first.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the funding provided to the NTPF for 2018 is also being used to address the Outpatient waiting list, which remains a significant challenge to be addressed this year. Each year, 3.3 million patients attend Hospital Outpatient clinics for appointments. It is worth noting that in 2017 almost half a million (477,000) outpatients did not attend their appointment. </p>  <p>  In order to address the issue of growing Outpatient waiting list numbers, I instructed the HSE to commence development of an Outpatient Action Plan for 2018, which has been submitted to my Department and is currently being finalised. This plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with their National Service Plan targets, reduce the increase in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services, improve the accuracy of the waiting list, and trial a number of NTPF funded interventions, including weekend and out of hours clinics.</p></reply>

The spawning biomass of this species is at an extremely low level, although conservation measures in recent years have had an impact in terms of stabilising the decline. The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing. The International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) advice is that there should be no targeted fisheries in 2017 and 2018 and that any possible provision for landing of bycatch should only happen as part of a management plan.</p>  <p>  The Marine Institute fully supports the ICES advice and has very serious concerns about the state of the stock. </p>  <p>  A very limited quota is available (53t for Ireland) for use in Pilot schemes designed to reduce such by-catches. Any such schemes are subject to EU Commission approval and must relate to reducing by-catches of spurdog in other fisheries i.e. the targeting of spurdog would remain prohibited.</p>  <p>  Such a scheme for spurdog avoidance was explored by the Marine Institute and, following consultation with industry, a draft pilot scheme was submitted for review to the Commission&rsquo;s Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).</p>  <p>  STECF raised a number of queries about the proposed scheme, in particular on whether or not it would result in a reduction in catches of spurdog relative to the catches that would occur in the absence of a scheme. Having considered the STECF comments and concerns, the Marine Institute reviewed the draft scheme and has now advised that Ireland should not proceed further with the spurdog avoidance scheme but rather work collaboratively with other Member States and the Commission to explore possible management measures for 2019. </p>  <p>  There is perhaps a mis-perception that a spurdog scheme as described here would allow small directed fisheries to operate.  That is not the case. Any such scheme would be a strictly controlled avoidance scheme only.</p></reply>

These rules are implemented through the National Goat Identification System (NGIS) which provides that any person keeping goats must firstly register the holding on which the goats are to be kept with my Department and must obtain a herd number. This is done through my Department's regional office network.  </p>  <p>  All goats kept are required to be tagged by 6 months of age or on leaving the holding of birth, which ever is soonest. When goats are being sold, the selling keeper must complete a NGIS dispatch / movement document on which the individual tag numbers of the goats are listed. One copy of this document must be retained by the selling keeper and another given to the purchaser. These must be retained by both parties for record keeping purposes.  It is not permitted to purchase goats without the holding, on which the animals are to be kept, being registered with my Department.</p>  <p>  It is an offence to keep a goat on a holding that is not registered with my Department.

Firstly, it is clear that the Bill as it currently stands cannot proceed without amendments. The EU recently published its proposal to address the top ten single use plastic items that make up approximately 70% of beach litter (cotton bud sticks, cutlery, plates, straws, beverage stirrers, balloon sticks) and these proposals do include a possible ban on some items. I fully welcomed the EU proposal on plastics, having written to the EU Commissioner in support of this, and I will not delay in introducing the necessary bans on the items provided for in the proposal when the EU legislation is finalised.  However, Section 3 of the Waste Reduction Bill goes beyond the EU proposal to include plastic beverage containers, which are considered as packaging under the EU Packaging Directive. Under this Directive, I am prohibited from banning such items.  Secondly, more information is needed in relation to the introduction of a Deposit and Return scheme. As such I cannot support a mandatory introduction of a scheme about which we do not have sufficient information to fully understand the impacts, positive or negative. The Joint Oireachtas Committee report supports these concerns, particularly around costs of implementation, the effectiveness of this in achieving the desirable environmental outcomes and any potential impact on the existing kerbside collection system. To address this, I have asked my officials to set up a pilot scheme which is in early planning stages. This will allow us to assess the likely impacts and costs of Deposit and Return in an Irish context. </p>  <p>  Finally, in line with Oireachtas procedures, once a Bill is examined after second stage, the Ceann Comhairle may write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requesting a money message which informs both the Committee and the sponsors of the Bill as to the decision received. The Ceann Comhairle has determined that this Bill could place a cost on the exchequer and as such, at this juncture the Bill can only progress in accordance with the procedures of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I have made it absolutely clear to the Joint Oireachtas Committee, at every opportunity, that I am very happy to help progress this important Bill. However, in addition to the proposals which are incompatible with EU law, I cannot agree to the compulsory introduction of a national Deposit and Return Scheme.  To agree to a mandatory scheme without proper analysis on the likely effect of increased costs for families and householders or evidence of its effectiveness in improving the recycling rates in this jurisdiction would be financially reckless.</p></reply>

Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, available at , which shows those areas that will be served by commercial operators and those that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP.  This includes approximately 300,000 premises to be passed as part of eir's rural deployment of high speed broadband as part of the Commitment Agreement signed in April 2017</p><p>Both eircodes referenced by the Deputy fall within the townland of Ballybaun (Killiam By) in Co. Galway.  The townland comprises a total of 9 premises.  5 of these premises are in an AMBER area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map, this includes the first of the eircodes referenced by the Deputy.  These premises will therefore be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP.  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>The remaining 4 premises, which includes the second referenced eircode (the commercial premises) referenced by the Deputy, are part of eir&rsquo;s planned rural deployment and will receive high speed broadband under that commercial deployment.Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at . </p><p>Data for Q1 2018 recently verified by my Department indicates that the company has passed some 145,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. eir has signalled that there has been some knock-on effects to the delivery of the 2018 milestone targets due to the severe weather impacts of both storms Ophelia and Emma. I have met with the senior management in eir and expressed to them the importance of implementing measures to catch up with milestone targets as a priority.</p><p>With regard to the rollout of broadband infrastructure, decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the rollout and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis by competing service providers operating in a liberalised market. I have no statutory role or function to intervene in the commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives are being undertaken through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.</p><p>A list of Broadband Officers, is available on my Department's website at .</p></reply>

The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) consumer helpline is accessible at and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.  Providing telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator.</p><p>Notwithstanding ComReg's independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.</p><p>Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, which will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland. </p><p>The fifth meeting of the Taskforce Implementation Group was held on 25 April 2018, and the Quarter 1 2018 Progress Report has since been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. This report offers progress updates on all Q1 actions.</p><p>In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:</p><p>- My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for deployment of telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p><p>- Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing under the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. It is planned to have dedicated Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in place to support this. </p><p>- A review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots. A focus group is continuing this work in 2018, to inform future policy development and initiatives. The work of this focus group will provide guidance on location categories where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority, taking account of customer expectations.</p><p>- ComReg is also developing a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and awareness raising activities, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p><p>In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p><p>All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

Ireland is highly reliant on the use of the land bridge as a route for the transport of goods to and from European continental ports via ports in Great Britain.</p>  <p>  The Irish Maritime Development Office is currently finalising a study into the use of the UK land bridge by Irish importers and exporters. The purpose of this research is to establish the volume of traffic using the UK land bridge at present, the likely consequences that Brexit will have on land bridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable. This research is expected to be completed shortly and will be published. This will assist my Department, other key Departments, and the relevant agencies in their ongoing preparations for a disorderly Brexit scenario. </p>  <p>  Irish ports operate as commercial companies and they are examining the implications of Brexit and preparing in order to ensure as far as possible the smooth transport of goods into and out of the State. Irish ports are also open to any opportunities that may arise from Brexit. </p>  <p>  Shipping companies are market driven and are already making provision for larger vessels with extra capacity on direct routes to continental Europe. A new larger vessel, the MV Celine, was recently launched from Dublin Port and will serve routes to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge.  The MV WB Yeats, which will operate between Dublin and France, is due to be launched later in 2018 and a new ferry route to Santander in Spain commenced from the Port of Cork last month.</p></reply>

It will include a full redesign of the bus network in order to provide a better and more efficient network for passengers; an expanded and modern fleet of vehicles; new road infrastructure to facilitate bus priority and faster journeys for public transport users, and also upgraded facilities for cyclists and pedestrians; improved passenger information and ticketing technology; and transition to a lower emission bus fleet.</p>  <p>  Last week, the NTA published a discussion document outlining the Core Bus Corridor Project that is part of a wider BusConnects programme for Ireland&rsquo;s cities, starting in Dublin and rolling out to Galway, Cork and Ireland&rsquo;s remaining cities.  The NTA&rsquo;s document focusses on the 230 km of continuous bus priority across 16 core bus routes expected achieve up to 40%-50% savings on current journey times and the 200km plus of cycle tracks/lanes and pedestrian facilities that are emerging as the likely core bus corridors in and out of Dublin city under this new investment Programme. It also confirms investment in low emission vehicles.</p>  <p>  According to the most recent (2016) estimates from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), only about 3% of all transport-derived CO2 emissions come from bus and coach fleets. Therefore, converting these vehicles to low-carbon alternatives will have a limited mitigation impact on Ireland's overall CO2 emissions; however, it will show some important leadership in this area and will undoubtedly begin to promote and normalise the use of non-conventional fuels and technologies to the public. Under the new National Development Programme, we have committed that, from July 2019 onwards, we will no longer buy diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet. Work is underway on preparing for implementation of this.  In tandem, an up-to-date and comprehensive set of vehicle trials is being planned to commence later this year to help further inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years. The technologies likely to be tested include full electrification, diesel-electric hybrids, and compressed natural gas; it is expected that the vehicles will be tested in both the GDA and in a regional city. The trials are likely to consider CO2 emissions, air quality impacts, and contribution potential towards renewable energy targets as well as costs, vehicle availability, and operational/infrastructural requirements. In 2017, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport established a &lsquo;Green Public Transport Fund&rsquo; to support the uptake of energy-efficient technologies for PSO operators within the bus and small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector and it is envisaged that in 2018 the NTA will employ the Fund to support the alternative urban bus fleet trials.</p>  <p>  Noting its responsibility with regards to this matter, I have referred the Deputy's queries to the NTA for consideration and direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

This is currently undertaken through service level arrangements with external organisations in receipt of funding from Tusla. Tusla does not provide capital funding for these services.</p>  <p>  This year funding of &euro;23.8m was allocated to Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence services, an increase of &euro;1.7m over 2017.</p>  <p>  With regard to the additional accommodation to which the Deputy refers there have been a number of delays that are outside the control of both Tusla and the service provider organisations involved.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised me of the current status of the three areas to which the Deputy's query relates:   </p>  <p>  1. The County Dublin Domestic Violence Service which was awarded funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme, operated by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, provides emergency accommodation units for victims and their children was due to open five new family units of accommodation early in 2018. There has been a delay in the transaction to acquire an identified property, which it is hoped will be resolved shortly. The identified building requires some work, and it is hoped that the units should come on stream in Q4, 2018.  </p>  <p>  2. Clare Haven Services, based in Ennis, Co. Clare plans to provide a new development with additional independent units of emergency accommodation. These new units will replace the current six refuge units that rely on shared communal areas. The project received approval for funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme. Since the original plan was approved there have been ongoing discussions locally about structure and ownership of the proposed development to achieve the most effective service model. However, the development will not be completed before 2020. Tusla will remain engaged with the service provider to support this development.  </p>  <p>  3. COPE Galway which currently runs Waterside House refuge in Galway, has plans to provide nine independent family units of emergency accommodation in Galway. These independent units will replace the existing six refuge units that rely on shared communal facilities. COPE Galway has started the tendering process to complete the building work, through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Local Authority. The closing date for receipt of tenders is mid-July. The original completion target for this project was 2018. However, due to the building location and the history of the site, the process to deliver these units has been very lengthy. COPE Galway expects that construction will start in Quarter 1, 2019.</p>  <p>  Tusla will continue to engage with service providers and other stakeholders to support and enable the provision of additional emergency domestic violence accommodation in areas of need.</p></reply>

The type of illness or the medical condition does not determine whether the person meets the care conditionality </p><p>The person receiving care is regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where:</p><p>- He or she is so incapacitated as to require continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to him or her/self, or continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions, and </p><p>- he or she is so incapacitated as to be likely to require full-time care and attention for a period of at least 12 months. </p><p>Also the means test for CA is the most generous in the social protection suite of income supports.  The means test applies disregards of &euro;332.50 of weekly income for a single/legally separated person and &euro;665.00 of weekly income for a carer who is married, in a civil partnership or co-habiting.  This disregard applies to any means that a carer may have i.e. earnings, savings, property, and in the case of weekly earnings from employment the disregard is applied after PRSI, superannuation and union contributions are deducted from the gross weekly income (in line with the disregards provided for all other social assistance schemes).  For a couple, the combined gross weekly means is then halved to give the carer's weekly means.</p><p>A carer whose partner is on the average weekly wage and has annual earnings of &euro;38,199 may therefore retain the full rate of &euro;214.</p><p>The main benefits of the payment and its current structure are that it can provide flexible support in many varied circumstances in its current form and therefore I do not consider it appropriate or necessary to change the scheme for specific conditions. </p><p>I hope this answer addresses the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

The rate of payment was reduced in May 2018 for a number of weeks due to the application of a penalty rate arising from non-engagement with the Department&rsquo;s Employment Services.  Full rate was restored when the customer resumed engagement.

As Minister, I am precluded from involvement in individual housing assessments, such as those outlined by the Deputies.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band are based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports has commenced.  The Housing Agency is carrying out the detailed statistical work on behalf of my Department and I expect the results of this review to be available for publication in late Summer 2018.</p><p>The Abhaile service, formally launched by the Government in 2016, is a national mortgage arrears resolution service, provided free of charge to the borrower and its aim is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and their lender to find the best solution for their particular situation.  The Money Advice and Budgetary Service (MABS) acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning (076)1072000 or by accessing their website at: <i>www.mabs.ie/abhaile.</i></p></reply>

This was made up of 540 applications from Cork, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow and 619 applications from Dublin.  There were 340 applications received from counties outside those listed.</p><p>Of the 1,499 applications received, 1,150 were deemed to be valid.  Of these valid applications, 876 had been assessed and 52% of these had been recommended for approval.  The average turnaround time for applications underwritten by the Housing Agency at the end of May was 22 calendar days. </p><p>Each local authority must have in place a credit committee and it is a matter for the committee to make the decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the regulations, having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency.</p><p>With regard to the values of the loans approved to date, figures are not available concerning the breakdown of amounts approved in the manner referred to.  However, the Housing Agency has advised that the average loan amount for the 458 applications recommended for approval by the end of May was &euro;189,133.</p></reply>

Since the national roll out, my Department has been working intensively with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to develop and implement the scheme.  There have been a number of national and local press advertising initiatives, as well as targeted online promotion, in an effort to ensure that property owners who can benefit from the scheme are aware of the benefits.</p><p>I can confirm that at the end of 2017, applications in respect of a total of 820 houses had been received by local authorities nationwide.  A total of 8 applications were received in the Meath County Council area, one of which was deemed suitable for social housing following an initial evaluation.  No lease agreements had been signed.  A detailed breakdown of the RLS data up to end Q4 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The nature of the RLS means that the period leading up to the signing of contracts-sourcing and inspecting the properties, and negotiation with owners-is the slowest part of the process.  All local authorities are active in sourcing and identifying potential properties and it is expected that significant numbers of contracts will be entered into once that process is complete.  Once contracts are signed, delivery is estimated at between 2 and 6 months, a fraction of the time involved for a build project.</p><p>Feedback from local authorities indicates that, in many cases, properties requiring extensive repair work, and therefore not suitable for the RLS, have been secured under the Buy and Renew Scheme which facilitates local authorities or AHBs to purchase vacant properties for social housing use.  In addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that the levels of vacancy recorded as part of Census 2016 have significantly reduced in the interim, particularly in urban areas like Dublin where many previously vacant homes have since been occupied. </p><p>It is clear from end 2017 output, that RLS has not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged.  I have reviewed the operation of the scheme, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and I have concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective.  At the Housing Summit held on 22 January 2018, local authority Chief Executives were advised that, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes were being made to the scheme.  These include:</p><p>- a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;</p><p>- increasing the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and</p><p>- provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. </p><p>I am making &euro;32 million available for the scheme in 2018 and I expect local authorities and AHBs to continue to implement the scheme locally.</p><p>Data in respect of Q1 2018 is currently being collated and will be available shortly.  My Department is actively engaging with all local authorities to accelerate the delivery of homes under this scheme.</p></reply>

A detailed breakdown of the RLS scheme data up to end Q4 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>It is clear from the end 2017 output that RLS has not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged.  I have reviewed the operation of the scheme, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and I have concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective.  At the second Housing Summit held on 22 January 2018, I announced a number of key changes to the scheme which took effect from 1 February 2018.  These include:</p><p>- a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;</p><p>- an increase in the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and</p><p>- provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. </p><p>I am making &euro;32 million available for the scheme in 2018 and I expect local authorities and AHBs to continue to implement the scheme locally.  The amount that has been been spent to date in 2018 is set out in the following table:</p><p><b>End May 2018 RLS Capital Spend</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>&euro; </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>&euro;39,889 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>&euro;8,698 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council</td><td>&euro;64,620 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;113,207 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Local authorities will also be able to apply to the new Serviced Sites Fund which will support delivery of both off- and on-site infrastructure which can unlock local authority-owned lands in order to deliver affordable homes.</p>  <p>  Given the cross-over between these funds, I have reviewed whether it is necessary to have a further call specifically under LIHAF, and I have concluded, in consultation with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, that the funds that had been allocated for the second call under LIHAF should be transferred to the new Serviced Sites Fund to increase the Exchequer funding available under the Fund from &euro;25 million to &euro;75 million over the period 2018 to 2021.  This funding will help to speed up the development of affordable housing from publicly-owned sites and I will be issuing a call for proposals under that Fund next week.</p></reply>

This funding, separate and in addition to normal sectoral funding streams, is designed to leverage a greater proportion of residential and commercial development, supported by infrastructure, services and amenities, within the existing built-up areas of our larger urban settlements.  The URDF will be a competitive bid-based programme that will operate on a multi-annual basis over the period to 2027.  </p>  <p>  An outline of the approach that the Government intends to take in relation to the URDF will be published shortly with URDF bids for funding invited on an initial three-year period to 2021, with the scope for further bids in 2019 and subsequently over the lifetime of the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the potential for synergies and overlaps between the URDF and the proposed Urban Renewal Fund, which it is envisaged will have a funding stream of &euro;50m over a four-year period, the scope of the latter scheme is currently being reviewed with a likely specific targeted focus on tackling dereliction and vacancy in our larger urban settlements.

The Government also provided flexibility to each local authority to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the maximum rent limit, where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions. </p>  <p>  At the end of Q4 2017, 22.4% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility.  When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 16.7% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility.  In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 15.2% above the relevant rent limits. Data for Q1 2018 will be available shortly.</p>  <p>  The previous revision to the maximum rent limits was proposed jointly by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and my Department following a comprehensive rent review process.  The review considered a number of data sources, namely the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) database, Daft.ie Rental Market Reports and the CSO Rental Indices.  Consultation and engagement with those administering both schemes was also carried out.  In relation to the Deputy's query, detailed analysis would be required to provide the figures requested in order to ensure any increases reflect the market trends experienced under both the rent supplement scheme and the HAP scheme.   </p>  <p>  My Department monitors HAP data on an ongoing basis, as well as other key information relating to the private rental market.  Indications are that the current HAP rent limits, and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits, provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs. </p>  <p>  I have no plans at present to increase HAP rent limits, a course of action which could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector and thereby have a potentially detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p></reply>

There are around 1,000 national monuments at approximately 750 sites around the country and these are managed by the OPW on the basis of a Service Level Agreement with the Department.  The National Monuments Service of my Department provides archaeological advice to the OPW on a routine basis and also with regard to the OPW Flood Relief Scheme, to ensure the appropriate protection of archaeology in the context of flood relief.  All works at or in the vicinity of a national monument &ndash; to include any works to mitigate water damage - are required to be notified to the Department, which ensures that appropriate controls are put in place for the protection of the site.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department meet regularly with their OPW counterparts to devise and agree shared policy approaches to areas of mutual interest, to review operational  priorities while also working closely together on a day-to-day basis in relation to individual projects.  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2018 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.</p></reply>

Over the last number of years, Irish talent has been a consistent presence at the Academy Awards, with Nora Twomey&rsquo;s debut animated feature,  The Breadwinner, leading the Irish charge at the most recent ceremony alongside other nominations for Irish talent including Saoirse Ronan, Consolata Boyle, Martin McDonagh and Daniel Day-Lewis.  The industry&rsquo;s current flourishing is the result of years of investment in Irish creative filmmaking talent by Screen Ireland (formerly the Irish Film Board).   </p>  <p>  Screen Ireland is the national development agency for Irish film making and the Irish film, television and animation industry.  Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Screen Ireland promotes the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  In addition it highlights the Irish screen industry at major international markets and festivals and promotes inward investment.  Screen Ireland liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise opportunities for the promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions as well as a tourism destination.  In Budget 2018, I allocated an increase of &euro;1.55 million or 9.3% to Screen Ireland to build on its vital work in supporting Irish film, television drama, documentary and animation.  This increased Screen Ireland's its annual budget to &euro;18 million.  Last month, the Government&rsquo;s capital investment plan Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027 provides for funding of &euro;200m to be invested in media production and audio visual industries through Screen Ireland over the next 10 years which will have a positive impact right across the country. </p>  <p>  The other primary mechanism through which the Government supports the film industry is Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the film tax relief scheme - which provides tax relief of 32% on expenditure in Ireland by qualifying film projects. </p></reply>

While my Department does not have a breakdown of the total flows of philanthropic funding to the sector, the Programme for a Partnership Government does contain a commitment to encourage strong, mutually beneficial links between the business community and the arts community to assist arts organisations to capitalise on sponsorship opportunities and to develop business partnerships and fundraising skills.  In this regard, I recognise the important work carried out by Business to Arts for which my Department provides a small amount of assistance.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Arts Council, which is funded by the Department, operates the RAISE programme, which seeks to enhance fund-raising skills in arts organisations with a view to diversifying the sector's sources of funding.  It is designed to assist the sector in securing philanthropic contributions to the arts in Ireland.     </p>  <p>  In terms of other capital investment requiring co-funding, a &euro;10 million investment scheme for arts and cultural centres is in progress, focussed on upgrading the existing stock of such centres around the country.  The funding, which is being made available as part of the Capital Investment Framework 2016-2021, is dependent on matching funding being secured by project promoters and therefore provides an opportunity for philanthropic support.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government capital investment plan Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage, which provides for investment of &euro;460m in a significant number of capital projects in our National Cultural Institutions over the next 10 years states that individual cultural institutions will be raising their own contributions (typically around 10%-15% of project costs) through philanthropic effort.</p></reply>
