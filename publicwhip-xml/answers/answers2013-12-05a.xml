The Act also provided Irish Water with the necessary powers to undertake the domestic water metering progamme. The Water Services (No. 2) Bill 2013, which was published on 2 December 2013, will provide for the transfer of water services functions from the 34 water services authorities to Irish Water.</p><p>  Irish Water has programme management arrangements in place in preparation for this transfer of functions from 1 January 2014, to provide for customer service and billing and to implement the domestic water metering programme. <i>The Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform programme agreed that, to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in asset management, capital delivery and operations would be restricted to staff in the partner organisations, which are the local authorities, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, and my Department. Open competitions are held for all other positions.  </i>Data supplied by Irish Water indicate that 203 staff have been recruited to the Irish Water organisation with 121 having taken up duty and 82 due to start. A further 80 staff from the local authorities and 4 staff from my Department have been seconded to Irish Water on a temporary basis. Recruitment beyond these numbers will be dependent both on budgets available and organisational needs.</p></reply>

The National Pensions Reserve Fund has provided a bridging loan facility to Irish Water to meet the costs arising to the end of 2013. This includes the initial stages of the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. </p><p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance and State support. In 2014, it is proposed to make a direct equity investment of &euro;240m from the Exchequer towards the capital funding of Irish Water. This will support projects to be included in Irish Water&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan. Work is also underway on the funding model for Irish Water&rsquo;s operational costs, to ensure that it can fund the Service Level Agreements being put in place with local authorities for the delivery of water services in 2014. Funding for this purpose will be made available to Irish Water through the Local Government Fund in 2014. Irish Water will also finance some of its costs (both capital and operational), including the liabilities transferred from local authorities, through borrowings and revenue from the non-domestic sector in 2014 </p></reply>

Hogan)  The 19<sup>th</sup> Conference of the Parties (COP19) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was held in Warsaw from 11 to 22 November, in conjunction with the 9<sup>th</sup> Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; the 39<sup>th</sup> sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies on Implementation and Scientific and Technical Advice, and the third part of the second session of the Ad-Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP). </p><p>  In addition to work focussed on further implementation of previous COP decisions and agreements, the Warsaw COP centred on making progress towards a new global agreement, to be concluded in COP 21 in Paris in December 2015. To this end, a key focus of the EU position going into these negotiations was to agree a clear process of work and analysis, including key milestones, for 2014 and 2015. This process is necessary to ensure that all Parties begin their domestic preparations in order to be in a position to bring meaningful emission reduction commitments to the table far enough in advance of the Paris COP to allow for peer review and discussion in terms of both their proposed ambition and fairness. Clarity on this process was achieved, along with agreement on specific actions to increase pre-2020 mitigation ambition &ndash; a vital element of the work under the ADP.</p><p>  Other key outcomes included important steps towards the operationalisation of the Green Climate Fund; agreement on a mechanism to address Loss and Damage; and agreement of the REDD Rulebook &ndash; a package of measures to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. While a decision on a work programme for agriculture was deferred until the next negotiating session in June 2014 , there was useful dialogue and sharing of views on agriculture, land use and forestry through workshops and a high-level event, in which Ireland was an active contributor. </p><p>  Overall, while in some areas of the negotiations it proved challenging to secure consensus across all 194 participating countries, there was a positive outcome for this COP &ndash; it is one further step on the road to 2015 and must be seen in that context. Ireland will continue to work within the EU and with our international partners to secure an ambitious and effective global agreement in Paris.</p></reply>

Together with the Minister for Housing and Planning, I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is optimise d in terms of resources and focus to maximise the response to social housing need. This must of course be achieved in a context in which public expenditure necessarily continues to be constrained. Nonetheless, in July 2012 the nister for Housing and Planning announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.</p><p>  In addition to the &euro;525.8m in housing programme expenditure provided for in my Department&rsquo;s Abridged Estimate for 2014, Budget 2014 provides a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million for   the State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and an additional &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants. When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes. Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in 2014 in the delivery of social housing and in particular in its capacity to attract external financial investment.</p><p>  In spite of our challenging economic circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will also be provided for social housing in 2014. </p></reply>

They provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through the development plan and development management processes. The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is currently undertaking a targeted review of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006 focusing on noise, proximity and shadow flicker.  My Department issued a press notice in January 2013 inviting submissions from the public on this targeted review.</p><p>  Earlier this year, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources commissioned the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to invite proposals from suitably qualified organisations for the completion of a desk study of peer reviewed studies and other documents that examine the significance of noise related to onshore wind farms. The objective of the study is to obtain evidence upon which to evaluate the appropriateness of the existing guidelines in relation to noise impacts and, if considered necessary, suggest changes. The study takes account of the following key contextual issues:</p><p>  - the evolution of wind turbine technologies since the current Guidelines were published in 2006;</p><p>  - experience to date in the application of the current Guidelines;</p><p>  - research relating to wind turbine noise issues since the current Guidelines were adopted. </p><p>  This study will form a key input into the review of the statutory guidelines. I understand the study is now being finalised, and this will allow for the publication shortly of revisions to the statutory wind guidelines in draft form. All statutory planning guidelines issue first in draft form for public consultation over a period of a couple of months.  The draft guidelines will &ndash; like all other new or revised guidelines &ndash; be available for extensive public consultation for a period of 6 weeks to 2 months, to allow for publication of the final guidelines by mid- 2014. Once the consultation period is closed, the submissions received on the draft guidelines will be considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines, which will issue to planning authorities under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). In the meantime all applications for wind energy development must be rigorously assessed in the light of the detailed advice in the 2006 guidelines.</p></reply>

The scheme includes a Wastewater Treatment Plant DBO Contract and a Network Contract. Cork County Council has recently submitted a Report on Tenders to my Department for the Wastewater Treatment Plant DBO Contract and this Report is currently under examination. The Council has also applied for a Foreshore Licence for the works including the installation of the outfall from the wastewater treatment plant. The processing of this application is a priority for my Department. Any decision on the Report on Tenders will be dependent on the outcome of the foreshore licence application. </p><p>  In July 2013 I approved funding of &euro;3.8m to enable the Council to award the Contract for the network element of the scheme. I understand that the Council intends to award this contract shortly.</p><p>  The Cork Lower Harbour Sewerage Scheme is also included in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &ndash; 2013 as a scheme to advance through Planning during the life of the Programme. I approved Cork County Council&rsquo;s design proposals for this scheme in March 2012. It remains a matter for the Council to proceed with the next stage of the scheme which is the preparation of contract documents.</p></reply>

I will shortly bring the General Scheme of a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill before Government for approval before the end of this year. Among other things, the Bill will underpin a new tenant purchase scheme for existing local authority houses along incremental purchase lines, involving discounts for purchasing tenants linked to household income and a discount-related charge on the property that will dwindle away over a period unless the house is resold or the purchaser fails to comply with conditions of the sale. The commencement date and detailed terms of the new scheme will be determined when the necessary regulations are made on enactment of the Bill.</p></reply>

The main initiatives which are being progressed through Comhairle na Tuaithe include the Pilot Mountain Access Scheme, a proposed National Indemnity Scheme and the Walks Scheme . The renewal of Walks Scheme contracts in respect of 14 trails involving almost 900 participants has been completed by the Rural Recre ation Section of my Department. It is my intention that the remaining trails on the scheme will be renewed as they fall due and additional participants brought on where possible to further enhance these iconic routes.</p><p>  The current expansion in the development of greenways and cycle lanes nationally is having a pos itive effect towards stimulating growth in the services and accommodation sector in many rural areas and my Department has approved LEADER funding for a number of such developments through the Local Development Companies. Approximately &euro;600,000 in additional funding was secured for the Rural Recreation budget in 2013 . This funding has been allocated and is assisting in maintaining the network of National Waymarked Ways and other priority walking routes of regional or national significance. I am fully aware of the importance of rural recreation to the Irish economy and I and my Department are committed to continuing to make progress including with the oversight of Comhairle na Tuaithe.</p></reply>

The Regulations brought into operation a grants scheme to assist with the cost of remediation of septic tanks and domestic waste water treatment systems which are deemed, following inspection under the EPA&rsquo;s National Inspection Plan and the subsequent issue of an Advisory Notice by the local authority, to require repair or upgrading. </p><p>  The Regulations provide that, subject to the applicant meeting all qualification criteria, a local authority may pay a grant to a person who is required, following an inspection, to have repairs or upgrades to, or replacement of, a septic tank or other domestic waste water treatment system. Applications for grant aid are administered by the local authorities in whose functional area the particular domestic waste water treatment system requiring remediation is situated. Where a local authority pays a grant under the scheme, my Department will recoup 100% of the amount paid by the local authority. To date, no applications for recoupment have been submitted by the local authorities to my Department. </p></reply>

The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities. It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the &lsquo;harder to reach&rsquo; in the most disadvantaged areas and communities, both urban and rural. </i></p><p>  The current LCDP Programme comes to an end at the end of 2013. The revised Programme will see a renewed emphasis on targeting the harder to reach individuals and communities. <i>The 2014 LCDP allocation is &euro;47.7 million. In allocating resources, I was particularly conscious of the need to support funding levels for the LCDP and to make the maximum contribution to job creation and economic recovery. The funding provided in 2014 will be invested to increase access to formal and informal educational activities and resources, and to increase people&rsquo;s work readiness and employment prospects. For example, some 14,000 people who are distanced from the labour market will receive direct one-to-one labour market training and supports through the Programme in 2014.</i></p><p>  The RAPID (Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development) programme covers urban areas designated as disadvantaged by reference to a range of socio-economic criteria including:   </p><p>  -  the levels of early school leaving; </p><p>  -  the proportion of one parent households; </p><p>  -  the unemployment rate; </p><p>  -  the proportion of social housing; and </p><p>  -  the age dependency rate. </p><p>The programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in bringing forward appropriate local projects in response to those needs. Enhanced alignment between local government and local development is intended to improve the targeting of such local development activity and will provide an opportunity for a stronger, collaborative, focus to be put on support for RAPID areas.   </p><p>The National Regeneration Programme targets the country&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities, those defined by the most extreme social exclusion, unemployment and anti-social behaviour. My Department currently supports an ambitious programme of regeneration projects which seek s   to address the causes of disadvantage in these estates through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration. </p><p>The National Regeneration Programme is a priority from a social policy perspective and also in terms of the job creation and economic renewal that are delivered as part of any regeneration programme. The value placed on the national regeneration programme is explicitly recognised in the Programme for Government and it is my objective to ensure that this important programme continues to be supported.   </p><p>An allocation of &euro;80 million was made to support the regeneration programmes under the National Regeneration Programme in 2013 in the following areas: Limerick City, Ballymun, Dublin City, Cork City, Dundalk, Sligo and Tralee.</p></reply>

In July 2013 we published <i>Building for the Future</i>, a voluntary regulation code and an important step towards a statutory regulatory framework.</p><p>  My Department, together with the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, is now working with the sector to develop a set of financial criteria to further enhance its capacity to contribute to housing provision. The voluntary regulation code , which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website , proposes three tiers or organisational classifications, of which Tier 3 includes the largest organisations, i.e. those bodies with more than 300 housing units or with sizable development plans . Under the voluntary code AHBs are expected to self-select the tier they believe best fits their organisation , considering their current activities. To date, just over 70 AHBs have signed up to the voluntary regulation code, of which 5 have been classified as Tier 3.</p><p>  Prior to the publication of the voluntary regulation code , AHBs were not classified into discrete categories . As a result my Department does not have a breakdown of the contribution by size of AHB to the quantity of housing delivered. However, details of the quantity of housing delivered by housing associations in each year from 2008 to 2012 are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  The 2013 housing statistics have not yet been finalised. Data to date in 2013 indicate that for the first three quarters of the year, some 100 units were delivered by AHBs under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme. In addition, to the end of October 2013, 558 social housing units were delivered by the sector under my Department's Social Housing Leasing Initiative.</p></reply>

On 18 July 2013, the Government approved the introduction of HAP and that the DSP would provide for the implementation of the mandatory direct deduction of rental contributions from the welfare payments of HAP recipients and local authority tenants.

Consideration, where possible, will be given to what aspects of the scheme can be progressed under existing mechanisms prior to enactment of the required legislation.

This process involved a preliminary examination of the organisational structure that will be required for HAP including change management issues that may arise and an outline of the main IT considerations which will need to be addressed. In the context of that exercise the CCMA, as part of the wider local government reform agenda, is considering delivery possibilities including costs and resource requirements.</p></reply>

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  The financial parameters within which we continue to operate rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. </p><p>In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. This is now to be further supplemented by an additional &euro;30m provided in Budget 2014 for capital expenditure on social housing. Approximately half of this investment will enable the construction of new infill developments in areas with high demand for social housing with the remainder invested in bringing long-term vacant units back into productive use. I intend to announce details shortly of these two measures with a view to having the investment programme up and running as early as possible in 2014. Budget 2014 also introduced a new &euro;10 million fund aimed at resolving unfinished estates where no development bond exists for carrying out essential public works.

It is a matter for the relevant housing authority to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the schemes, and to have appropriate oversight and liaison arrangements in place for the effective administration of the schemes and for ensuring that the investment in voluntary housing is safeguarded. </p><p>  At the end of 2012 a total of 25,371 units of accommodation had been provided by Approved Housing Bodies (AHB&rsquo;s) under my Department&rsquo;s capital funding schemes since the inception of the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) in 1984 and the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) in 1992. Exchequer funding of &euro;1.3 billion was provided under the CAS for the provision of some 15,262 units of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing need such as older people, the homeless and persons with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability.</p><p>  Under the CLSS, mortgage finance was provided to AHB&rsquo;s by way of loans from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to meet the cost of providing social rented accommodation for low-income families. At end 2012, AHB&rsquo;s had provided some 10,109 units of accommodation and loans to the value of around &euro;1.4 billion had been drawn down from the HFA. The CLSS was terminated in 2009 and expenditure in respect of projects over the period 2010 to end 2012 relates to projects at construction or approved to commence construction prior to the decision to terminate the scheme.   </p><p>  In 2011 the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) was introduced to facilitate the securing of finance by AHB&rsquo;s from sources other than the Exchequer, including from the HFA and private lending institutions. The CALF provides a capital equity injection which assists in securing such finance. To date over &euro;10 million has been advanced to AHBs using this facility which has supported the provision of 158 social housing units. </p><p>In accordance with legislative provisions set out under Section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966, local authorities are responsible for the management and maintenance of their social housing stock. A number of AHB&rsquo;s have entered into service level agreements with local authorities for the management and maintenance of social housing units which may be either leased or owned by the relevant authority. Details of these arrangements and the numbers of properties involved are not available in my Department.</p><p>  With regard to regulating the management and operation of AHBs, my Department has developed, in consultation with the AHB sector, a voluntary regulation code as a precursor to a statutory regulatory framework for the sector to support its long-term<i></i>growth.<i></i><b></b>The voluntary regulation code &ndash; <i><i>Building for the Future</i></i> - was published on 15 July 2013 and it is anticipated that the majority of AHBs will engage with the code as it will present an opportunity to influence the final shape of statutory regulation which, it is intended, will be in place by 2016.</p></reply>

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing. The Local Government Fund will continue to receive motor tax receipts in 2014.</p><p>  It should be noted that t he funding to be provided to local authorities for the provision of water services in 2014 will be governed by Service Level Agreements between Irish Water and individual authorities.</p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014. Service provision responsibilities will shift from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure will be transferred, financing arrangements will alter and local authorities will operate on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements. These changes must be managed. In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. This decision has been taken in the context of Budget 2014. The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced shortly. It will be a matter for each local authority to determine how best to us e General Purpose Grant revenue in line with local priorities and circumstances; I have no plans to issue new guidelines or to make new regulations in that regard.</p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p></reply>

The Forum initially comprised the Departments of An Taoiseach (in the Chair), Finance and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, as well as five private philanthropic organisations.</p><p>  On 1 May 2011, responsibility for the Forum was transferred to my Department. I broadened its focus to support the development of both philanthropy and fundraising. During 2012, the Forum set out ambitious plans to increase philanthropic giving from its current estimated level of approximately &euro;500 million per annum to &euro;800 million by 2016. The drivers for this increase in giving fall under four overarching themes: a national giving campaign, fiscal and infrastructure recommendations, fundraising capacity improvements and a social innovation fund.   </p><p>Very significant progress has been made on the implementation of the Forum&rsquo;s plans. A National Giving Campaign, the one percent difference, has been launched &ndash; details of the campaign are on the website . The tax treatment of donations to charities has been simplified and decoupled from business tax incentives, a road map has been set out for the implementation of the Charities Act and the setting up of a Charities Regulator and the Social Innovation Fund are in the early stages of development. </p><p>  My Department continues to support the Forum. Funding of approximately &euro;1.9 million over a three-year period is being allocated to Philanthropy Ireland on the basis that it is matched with funding from philanthropic sources. This funding is being used to support the Giving Campaign and initial set-up costs of the social innovation fund.</p><p>  A further allocation of approximately &euro;400,000 over a three-year period is also being provided by my Department to Fundraising Ireland, once again on the basis that it is matched by funding from philanthropic sources. This funding will contribute to the professionalisation of fundraising within the sector.   </p><p>  I share the Forum&rsquo;s view that, even in these difficult times, we have the opportunity to substantially increase the level of private investment in the philanthropic and fundraising sectors. It is not intended to substitute for Government investment, but to supplement it. As well as unlocking significant private funding to address fundamental social and economic challenges, increased private giving to good causes will also support the Government&rsquo;s strategy to increase employment. </p></reply>

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for p ublic domestic water supplies has been the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme. The current Programme runs to the end of 2013 and includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation. The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.</p><p>  In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the <i>Programme for Government</i> provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure from 1 January 2014. Irish Water will be responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure from 1 January 2014, and is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014-15. This Plan will include taking account of the transition of projects that are included in the curren t Water Services Investment Programme.</p></reply>

However, the use of long-term bonds to secure satisfactory reinstatement of the site upon cessation of the project puts an unreasonable burden on developers, given the long time span involved in wind energy developments, and is difficult to enforce. The recycling value of the turbine components, particularly copper and steel, should more than adequately cover the financial costs of the decommissioning.

Building on the original Geneva communiqu&eacute; of 30 June 2012, the aim of the conference is to reach agreement on the formation of an inclusive transitional governing body which will replace the Assad regime and end the terrible conflict which has ravaged Syria since early 2011.    The Syrian opposition have been requested and are being strongly encouraged by the UN and by UN/Arab League Special Representative Lahkdar Brahimi to make every effort to field a united negotiating team for the Geneva II conference. It will ultimately be for each segment of the opposition, including the representatives of the Kurdish community within Syria, to decide their own position on the conference but I imagine they will wish to give careful consideration to the views of UN Secretary General Ban and Joint Special Representative Brahimi as convenors of the conference. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-05a.93.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013120500057#WRB00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 43 and 44 together. </p><p>  The protracted and tragic crisis in Syria has resulted in unprecedented levels of humanitarian need, requiring a sustained response from the international community. As the number of fatalities rises towards 120,000, including 12,  000 children under five, there are now approximately nine million people who are in need of immediate life-saving support. In addition to more than 6.5 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are currently 2.2 million Syrians who have fled to neighbouring countries. </p><p>  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. We have provided more than &euro;14 million in assistance since the crisis began, of which almost &euro;11.4 million was provided in 2013. In addition,   Ireland is an important donor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which this year has allocated US$82 million to Syria and neighbouring countries. A second pledging conference for Syria and region is due to take place in Kuwait in January 2014 and we are examining the possibility of future Irish assistance.</p><p>  Irish Aid has channelled our humanitarian aid through key UN and NGO partners, as well as through the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement. These agencies are selected on the basis of their capacity to deliver impartial assistance to large numbers of people, both within Syria and to refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries. Our funding to international organisations remains un-earmarked so that assistance can be targeted where it is most needed, ensuring that it reaches the most vulnerable and marginalised regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation. Irish humanitarian aid is being distributed across Syria.  We are in close contact with our humanitarian partners in the field and they have not reported any specific issue related to the interference of neighbouring countries in the delivery of supplies to Kurdish areas in Syria. </p><p>  We have worked closely with our humanitarian partners to ensure that the necessary systems are in place to monitor and evaluate the use and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s assistance. We insist that our partners fully adhere to the principles of &lsquo;Good Humanitarian Donorship&rsquo;, promoting accountability, efficiency and effectiveness in implementing humanitarian action. </p><p>  It is a particularly regrettable feature of this conflict that, while millions of people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, indiscriminate attacks on civilians and humanitarian personnel continue unabated, and armed groups on both sides continue to disregard their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. The Government of Ireland has matched its material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis.  We have called clearly for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access. We have called for all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from the targeting of civilians.</p><p>  Ireland has been consistent in its efforts at EU level to ensure the necessary attention is given by the international community to this crisis. Throughout our EU Presidency in the first half of this year, Ireland repeatedly underlined the gravity of the humanitarian situation, including in regular discussion at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  The Council Conclusions on Syria issued following the most recent meeting of the Council, last month, condemned the continuing widespread and systematic violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in Syria, including increasing attacks on religious and ethnic communities.   The Council further called for the facilitation by all parties of safe, unhindered and immediate access to populations in need of assistance in the entirety of the Syrian territory, including across conflict lines and across borders from neighbouring countries. The Conclusions reaffirmed that only a political solution that results in a united, inclusive and democratic Syria can end the crisis.</p><p>  The humanitarian crisis in Syria is likely to be on the agenda for this month&rsquo;s Development Ministers Council and I will be strongly supporting the continuation of the EU&rsquo;s role as the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people.  In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland will continue to call for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort, both within the EU and more broadly internationally.  </p></reply>

I saw how the ongoing political turmoil and insecurity in the Middle East is resulting in a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. I share the concerns expressed recently by the UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. James Rawley. Indeed I had the opportunity to discuss these issues with him during my visit. </p><p>  While Israeli restrictions have eased marginally in recent times, the overall situation in Gaza has worsened in recent months as Egypt has taken action against smuggling into Gaza, in response to its own security concerns.  The existing fuel shortfall and shortage of supply of building materials, accentuated by the closure of tunnels, is affecting the daily lives of residents, their electricity supply and water and sewage facilities.</p><p>  High youth unemployment, low wages and high food prices remain serious concerns. The food security situation, however, is the principal cause for alarm. More than 800,000 of the over 1.2 million Palestine refugees in Gaza receive food assistance from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which is providing basic education, health, relief and social services for some 5 million registered Palestinian refugees across the region.</p><p>  Ireland has responded to the current crisis by providing additional funding of &euro;500,000 to UNRWA to support the food assistance element of their Gaza Emergency Appeal.  This brings Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to UNRWA&rsquo;s appeals for Gaza to &euro;4.64 million since 2006. UNRWA&rsquo;s food assistance provides a lifeline for thousands of refugee families in Gaza and helps to prevent a potentially large scale crisis in a context where an estimated 57% of households are classified as food insecure.</p><p>  This funding support is in addition to Ireland&rsquo;s broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people and brings our total funding support to date in 2013 to &euro;8.3 million. This includes support to UNRWA&rsquo;s general fund, the Palestinian Authority, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and civil society organisations working to promote human rights and democratisation.</p><p>  In addition to our humanitarian support, the Government raises the problems facing Gaza and its people both directly with Israel and through EU engagement with Israel. This includes regular contacts between the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv and the Israeli authorities, and between officials and the Israeli Embassy in Dublin. In addition to my own visit, the T&aacute;naiste travelled to Gaza last year to highlight the desperate living conditions being experienced by people as a result of the blockade of the territory. Ireland also raised the situation in Gaza in the universal review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in October. In these contacts, we consistently call on Israel to end the restrictions on Gaza, and call on other states to do more to exert pressure in this regard.</p><p>  Ireland will continue to support actively the search for a lasting and peaceful political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,  as well as the wider region.  In the meantime we will continue to offer the humanitarian support which is essential in addressing the ongoing basic needs of the Palestinian people.</p></reply>

The Council discussion is also likely to focus on EU support for the ongoing destruction of Syrian chemical weapons overseen by the UN and OPCW as well as addressing the dire humanitarian crisis in Syria and neighbouring states.  At last month&rsquo;s Council, I emphasised the importance of more concerted action on the part of the international community to improve humanitarian access within Syria and remove the all too many obstacles which continue to exist to the provision of urgent assistance to the millions of Syrians in need within the country. I would again plan to raise this topic and support urgent consideration by the UN Security Council of a binding resolution on the humanitarian situation, to follow up on the Council&rsquo;s Presidential statement of 2 October on this subject.</p></reply>

It is estimated at present that the typhoon affected 14.4 million people, with over 3.6 million remaining displaced, including approximately 1.5 million children. The full human toll of this disaster remains unclear but over 5,600 deaths have been confirmed to date.</p><p>  Ireland was among the first to respond to this disaster, providing immediate, life-saving assistance.  To date, the Government has provided over &euro;3.6 million in humanitarian assistance, making Ireland one of the most generous contributors to the relief effort on a per capita basis.  Of this assistance, over &euro;2.6million in funding has been provided through our key NGO partners for the provision of emergency food and non-food items; water, sanitation and hygiene; emergency health care and protection of vulnerable women and children.  Ireland&rsquo;s support will benefit up to 50,000 households.</p><p>  To date, Irish Aid has authorised four airlifts of essential relief items, the most recent of which arrived in the Philippines on Monday, 2 December. This brings the total amount of essential relief items provided by Ireland to 166 tonnes, valued at &euro;967,000 in total. According to the latest figures, Ireland is the second largest contributor of emergency stocks through the UN World Food Programme Humanitarian Response Depot system, second only to the World Food Programme itself.  We have also deployed five members of the Rapid Response Corps to the Philippines to assist UN relief.</p><p>  An Irish Government's technical mission arrived in the Philippines on 28 November and travelled to the worst affected area, Tacloban City. The purpose of this mission is to prepare a detailed analysis of the longer-term needs of the worst affected regions and to explore ways in which Ireland can most effectively contribute to the recovery process.  The team will return to Dublin later this week and report to the T&aacute;naiste and me, with recommendations on how Ireland can assist the Philippines in the medium to long term.</p><p>  The international community has so far contributed a total of US $394 million in response to this disaster.   Of this, $167 million has been provided to the UN appeal which is at present 48% funded. This includes $25 million from the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which Ireland is an important contributor.</p><p>  While the situation in the Philippines was not on the formal agenda for November&rsquo;s EU Foreign Affairs Council, the T&aacute;naiste took the opportunity to discuss with his EU colleagues the wider EU response to the crisis.  Department officials are in regular contact with the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) and, in particular, the EU Emergency Response Centre. As of the end of November, the EU and its Member States had provided over &euro;130 million in support to the relief effort. Just last week, in Brussels, I also discussed the EU response with the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, who recently returned from the region. </p><p>  While the agenda has not yet been finalised, I would expect that I will have the opportunity to discuss the evolving situation in the Philippines and the role the EU should play in the recovery process at the Development segment of the Foreign Affairs Council, which I will attend, in Brussels, on 12 December. </p></reply>

As highlighted by the UN Secretary General in his report to the Security Council on 15 November, this conflict has the potential to escalate, with untold consequences for the people of the Central African Republic and of the wider region. </p><p>  I am also concerned at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, where with at least a quarter of the population is currently in need of humanitarian assistance.   The worsening security situation is increasingly limiting humanitarian access to vulnerable populations in need of assistance.  However, humanitarian organisations with a long-standing presence in the country, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, continue to secure negotiated access to affected populations in order to provide urgent relief.</p><p>  Ireland has a clear commitment to addressing the effects of protracted crises, which often do not receive the attention they deserve.  We are long-standing funders of the UN-administered Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) for the Central African Republic. For a number of years, Ireland and Sweden, have been the two EU Member States to support this Fund, with Ireland providing an average annual contribution of over &euro;2 million since 2009. In view of the recent deterioration of the situation in the Central African Republic and the related increase in acute humanitarian need, we welcome the recent decision by the Netherlands also to contribute to this Fund.  This year, we have provided &euro;2 million to the Common Humanitarian Fund, allowing the UN and NGOs present in the Central African Republic to undertake life-saving work with the most vulnerable communities. </p><p>  I welcome the African Union peacekeeping Mission (MISCA), which is in the process of deployment in the Central African Republic.  The UN is currently considering how best the international community can support the MISCA Mission. </p><p>  Ireland is working closely with our European Union partners to monitor and coordinate efforts in response to the unfolding crisis in the Central African Republic, and I look forward to addressing the issues involved with my colleagues in the Foreign Affairs Council. </p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing OPFTC and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The new credit will be targeted such that it is available in the first instance, to the primary carer of the child. A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child. This is the same condition that applies to the current OPFTC.     There is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code and married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in maintaining their children. This is despite the fact that in certain cases such couples may also have to maintain two households due to the location of employment.</p><p>  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child, as can happen with the OPFTC, is unsustainable.  </p><p>  In the first instance, it is the responsibility of the parents to look after a child including financially.  The new credit is targeted to assist principal child carers to take up, or remain in employment. It should not be considered merely as a supplementary source of income, or an alternative to the financial support of a parent. </p><p>  Maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable.  </p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, after listening carefully to the views expressed by my colleagues and many Deputies in this matter, I bought forward an amendment to the section at Committee Stage of the Finance (No 2) Bill 2013, which will allow the credit to be used by a non-primary carer in situations, for example, where the primary carer has no tax liability.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), the tax for 2014 is payable on or before 1 January 2014.  Consequently, there is no requirement on property owners to pay their 2014 LPT before 1 January 2014.  The range of payment options provided by the Revenue Commissioners ensures that nobody needs pay LPT before that date (except in a case where a property is changing hands) and also provide the flexibility for a property owner to select a payment option that best suits their particular circumstances.</p><p>  I understand that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners dealt with this issue comprehensively when she attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 7 November 2013.  The Chairman informed the Committee that in order to provide for a delayed payment of LPT by way of credit/debit card, Revenue would be required to retain taxpayer&rsquo;s credit/debit card data.  The Commissioners would be very concerned about retaining such data from a data protection perspective, as it is not best practice, and other issues, including costs, also arise.  Recent well-publicised data breaches arising from the retention of such data underline those concerns.  The Chairman agreed that the Commissioners would review the payment patterns for 2014 to establish the proportion of owners who choose to pay the tax by credit/debit card and that they would also carefully review the issues around retaining debit/credit card data and its potential impact on systems, costs, security and data protection.  </p><p>  The Deputy should also be aware that for those with a debit card, payment by way of single debit authority is a simple, safe, secure alternative, which also provides property owners with an extended payment date of 21 March 2014.</p></reply>

This approach was primarily adopted to delay the application of the carbon tax to solid fuel in the residential sector to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply.  Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011.  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.</p><p>  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.</p><p>  The carbon tax was applied to solid fuels on a phased basis in Budget 2013 but its implementation was delayed until after the last winter period i.e. from 1 May 2013 at a rate of &euro;10 per tonne with a further &euro;10 per tonne to be applied from 1 May 2014 to bring the rate of carbon tax in line with that of all other fuels.</p><p>  While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes senses to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p><p>  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels i.e. coal and commercial peat (mainly peat briquettes and some turf), from 1 May 2013 has meant an increase in price of &euro;1.20 in the case of coal (40kg bag) and 26 cents in the case of a bale of briquettes, based on current prices.  This represents an 8.2% and 6.7% percentage increase in the price of coal and peat briquettes respectively.  This relatively high percentage increase is due in part to those products having little or no excise applied to them prior to the carbon tax.  It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels and therefore attract a higher carbon tax. </p><p>  Accordingly I do not intend to defer the further increase of &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 emissions from 1 May 2014.</p></reply>

Therefore, tax relief will continue to be available in respect of interest paid by an individual on qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, regardless of whether they are considered first-time buyers or non-first-time buyers.      </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  This was the period during which house prices peaked.</p><p>  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 <i>or</i> if they drew down their mortgage in that period.  In addition, the increased rate of tax relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year. </p><p>  A qualifying loan for mortgage interest relief is one which without having been used for any other purpose, is or are used in the purchase, repair, development or improvement of a claimant&rsquo;s principal private residence.  </p><p>  I have no plans to increase or widen the scope of relief.  As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.  You will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the significant budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

All credit unions are required to ensure that they apply scrutiny to all new loan applications and that all applications are fully assessed to determine the borrower&rsquo;s ability to repay. Credit unions are also required to ensure that they put in place clear limits on the total funds available for granting loans, bearing in mind the need to ensure that they maintain adequate levels of liquidity to support their operations.  </p><p>  In order to protect the members&rsquo; savings, it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns about the operation of individual credit unions and the resultant risk to members&rsquo; savings. The number of lending restrictions in place is a reflection of the Registrar&rsquo;s concerns about lending practices in the sector.</p><p>  The individual credit union lending restrictions currently in place are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether they are still set at appropriate levels.</p><p>  All moneylenders are required to be licensed by the Central Bank, and this category of financial service provider includes:</p><p>  - home collection firms where repayments are collected at the customer&rsquo;s home;</p><p>  - remote firms where payment is made directly to the firm e.g. by direct debit;</p><p>  - retail firms involved in the provision of goods on credit with repayments being made by a variety of methods e.g. cash, direct debit; and</p><p>  - other firms who operate on the basis of running accounts e.g. catalogue companies. </p><p>  The Central Bank recently published a Report on the Licensed Moneylending Industry which is available on its website.  The research was undertaken to inform the regulatory approach to the licensed moneylending industry in Ireland and to see how the firms are treating their customers.  The Report states that there are 43 licensed moneylenders in operation and outstanding loan amounts are in the region of &euro;200 million; in contrast, outstanding loan amounts in the credit union sector stand at some &euro;4.6bn.</p><p>  A key finding of the report is that the overriding catalyst for borrowing from moneylenders is convenience and ease of availability and that there is a willingness by these customers to pay a premium for what they perceive to be convenience and access to credit.  When asked why they used moneylenders, only 5% of customers responded that it was because they had been refused credit elsewhere, notwithstanding the fact that 77% of respondents report being refused credit elsewhere in the past.  The existence of lending restrictions at credit unions does not emerge as a factor in customers using licensed moneylenders. </p><p>  Where the Central Bank becomes aware of a case of suspected illegal moneylending, it will refer the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

For the year 2014, the liability date is 1 November 2013 and the tax is payable on or before 1 January 2014.  Where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  </p><p>  These dates have been in the public domain since December 2012 when the legislation was passed and 1 November liability date has been the subject of several occasions previous Parliamentary Questions, including my reply to Question No. 110 on 27 March this year.  I also informed the House in my replies to Questions Nos. 221 (49518/13) and 223 (49556/13) on 19 November 2013 that having a liability date before the year commences is preferable as there is certainty about who the liable person is for the coming year, that person has a reasonable amount of time to make the necessary provisions and they have access to the widest possible range of options for paying the tax.  In particular, the liable person can put the required arrangements in place to ensure that phased payments by way of direct debit or deduction at source from employment, occupational pension or from certain Government payments would commence from January 2014 and would spread payment of the full LPT liability evenly over the course of 2014.</p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year. Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I would expect that the LPT liability involved is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  </p><p>As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, I am advised that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>   and on the Law Society&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  The liability date for 2014 of 1 November 2013 is settled, has been approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation and I have no plans to change the law in question.  Since the 2014 liability date of 1 November 2013 is provided for in the legislation, any owner selling their residential property between 2 November and 31 December 2013 cannot therefore appeal their liability for LPT on the property for 2014. </p></reply>

Since the introduction of Tax Relief at Source (TRS) in respect of mortgage interest payments in 2002, &lsquo;interest charged&rsquo; and &lsquo;interest paid&rsquo; figures generally reconciled in the vast majority of cases over any 12 month period.  In such circumstances, Revenue agreed with lenders to allow the relief on the basis of both &lsquo;interest charged&rsquo; and &lsquo;interest paid&rsquo; for ease of administration. A key part of the agreement required the lenders to inform Revenue of the exceptional cases where cumulative arrears had built up over an 18 month period. All such cases were reviewed on a case by case basis and the relief was withdrawn where appropriate. The 18 month &lsquo;review period&rsquo; was reduced to 6 months in September 2012 in response to the increasing numbers of mortgage arrears cases. </p><p>  As the number of arrears cases being reported by the lenders continued to increase, Revenue further reviewed the practice of allowing the relief on both &lsquo;interest charged&rsquo; and &lsquo;interest paid&rsquo; and on the basis of the review, has instructed all lenders to only allow TRS in line with the requirements of the legislation with effect from 1 January 2014, i.e. interest paid by the borrower. </p><p>  The new arrangements will have no impact for borrowers who pay the correct mortgage amount on time, in accordance with the terms of their loan. In instances where borrowers do not make payments or pay less than the amount of interest due, then the TRS amount will be reduced to reflect the actual amount paid. </p></reply>

With a view to keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers, there is no notification procedure for employers involved. Accordingly, the Revenue Commissioners do not have statistics on the uptake of the scheme. The scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation.   The purchase of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers for employees or directors is subject to the normal Revenue audit procedure with the normal obligations on employers to maintain records (e.g. delivery dockets, invoices, payments details, etc.). The employer is also obliged to keep all salary sacrifice agreements entered into between the employer and employees/directors, together with all signed statements from employees/directors regarding use of the bicycles and safety equipment.</p><p>  It was estimated at the time of the introduction of the scheme that approximately 7,000 employees would avail of it over the first five-year period of its operation at a cost of &euro;0.4 million in a full year. However anecdotal evidence would suggest that the scheme has been considerably more successful than this. The exemption may apply only once in any five year period in respect of any employee.</p></reply>

The formulation of the MTES is being jointly led by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but the Strategy is a whole-of-Government initiative. Consequently, its production is not being coordinated by any one individual, but by a high-level group comprising of officials from the two Departments, the Department of Taoiseach, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Forf&aacute;s. In addition, a wider group of officials has been established to coordinate with other Government Departments regarding the sectors of the economy which come under their aegis. </p><p>  While all such documents naturally evolve during development, the scope of the MTES has not changed substantially from what was originally envisaged. The Strategy will provide a framework to underpin a range of policy efforts in a manner that provides financial market stability and also underpins consumer and business confidence for investment. By providing certainty and confidence that the mistakes of the past will not be repeated, the Strategy will support economic growth and, in so doing, help us to tackle our budgetary and unemployment problems and enable an improvement in the living standards of Irish citizens.</p></reply>

The main craft trades have been designated by SOLAS and come within the scope of the Statutory Apprenticeship system.  While there are apprenticeships in the electrical and mechanical sectors, there is no apprenticeship in Mechanical Engineering at present.  The full list of apprenticeship trades is available at www.solas.ie along with eligibility requirements.</p><p>  To be registered as an apprentice, a person must first must obtain employment as an apprentice in their chosen occupation.  Some apprenticeship job vacancies are advertised on the Department of Social Protection website, www.welfare.ie , under the section titled &quot;Jobseekers&quot;.

The home tuition continues from their 3rd birthday if no placement in a school based autism early intervention class is available for them.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a national network of Special Educational Needs Advisors who can assist parents in identifying school placements for their children, if required.</p><p>  As home tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Tuition Scheme generally reflects that required in a school environment.  The qualification requirements for tutors providing home tuition to children have not changed.  It remains the case that home tutors should be fully qualified teachers.  When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then alternative appropriate third level qualifications may be acceptable.  However, from this year my Department has also required that, in addition to being qualified teachers, tutors must be registered or have applied for registration with the Teaching Council of Ireland.  Tutors with acceptable third level qualifications will be eligible to apply for registration.  Qualifications in psychology at the required level are acceptable for this purpose.  Accordingly, those whose qualifications were acceptable in the past remain eligible, provided they have applied for registration with the Teaching Council.</p></reply>

In that regard, the Department was granted a limited derogation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which allowed administrative and maintenance posts in ETB schools to be sanctioned in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  The school to which the Deputy refers is an Education and Training Board (ETB) school.  The Department provides a caretaking/maintenance staffing allocation to each ETB, and the distribution of this staffing allocation amongst its schools is a matter for the ETB in question.  Accordingly, requests for additional maintenance staff are made to the Department by ETBs, not by individual schools.  In May 2011 the Department received a request from Co Wexford VEC for additional caretaking resources, in respect of the school to which the Deputy refers.  This request was not granted, in the context of the moratorium on recruitment.  The VEC appealed the Department's decision in October 2011 and this appeal was not upheld.  The Department has not been contacted by the VEC/ETB since that point in time, although a number of representations have more recently been made in the matter.  If the school authorities wish to pursue this matter they should address their concerns to Waterford and Wexford ETB in the first instance.</p></reply>

It is therefore necessary to legislate for the new sick leave scheme and the <i>Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Amendment Bill 2013 </i>is being amended<i></i>  at Report Stage to include a new Part relating to the new sick leave arrangements. This piece of legislation is scheduled to complete all stages in the Oireachtas by the end of this year. The legislation will provide the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with the power to make regulations that will set out the specific details of the new sick leave scheme.  These regulations will also be in place by the end of the year.</p></reply>

There are clear guidelines in place for determining pay levels and for seeking the sanction of my Department on pay levels where it is required in any particular instance.</p><p>  The guidelines on staffing in ministerial offices were revised following decisions by the Government on a number of cost saving measures relating to the personal appointees of Ministers and Ministers of State. The guidelines specify that all appointments of ministerial staff, including the pay and terms and conditions of employment, require the prior sanction of my Department. Appointments from outside of the Civil Service also require the sanction of the Taoiseach.</p><p>  The guidelines provide that special advisors are to be placed on the principal officer (standard scale), which currently runs from &euro;75,647 at the minimum to &euro;87,258 at the maximum. They provide that appointments are to be on the first point of the scale but there would be occasions when a higher salary may be required in order to secure the appointment of an advisor with particular skills and expertise. </p><p>  On this basis, the guidelines provide for individual cases to be examined on a case by case basis. For example, in cases where, prior to appointment, the basic pay of a special advisor was greater than the minimum, it is open to Ministers to seek sanction from my Department to appoint the person at a higher starting level.  I have no plans to ask the Government to amend these arrangements.</p></reply>

These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and from senior executives of existing companies.</p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. In order to achieve economic regional development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With improvements in infrastructure and investment in one town in a region it has a positive effect on other towns in the region.</p><p>  The East Region, which includes Wicklow, has been particularly successful in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment from FDI companies and employing 67,860 people.  At present, there are 17 IDA supported companies in County Wicklow employing 2,267 people.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites. </p><p>  Last year Wicklow CEB approved funding for 37 projects, with an associated job creation projection of 88.  The Board provided training for 430 participants and 41 companies were assigned a mentor.  So far in 2013, Wicklow CEB has approved funding for 24 projects, with an associated job creation project of 69.

I am currently preparing the 2014 Action Plan on behalf of the Government and we will continue, through that process, to build on the success of the actions we have taken over the last two years.</p></reply>

There are approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.</p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have come into force with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  The Department currently funds up to 30% of the private rented sector so it is essential that the rent limits are kept under review.  The new rent limits have been set using the 35th percentile ensuring that sufficient housing is available for recipients of the scheme.</p><p>  Under the revised rent limits, there have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin while there have been some reductions across a number of rural counties reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties.  Rent limits in County Kilkenny were maintained with the exception of the family with two children rate which reduced by &euro;10 per month.  In County Carlow there were reductions in some rent limit categories with the exception of the single person rate which increased.</p><p>  As existing claims come up for review, or when an existing lease expires, they will be reassessed using the new limits.  Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.  Departmental guidance to the officers administering rent supplement states that where negotiation with the landlord fails then rent supplement may continue to be paid for a period of up to thirteen weeks at the higher rate. However, once the lease has expired the tenant will be expected to find suitable accommodation at below the new limits in force.</p><p>  Analysis of the County Carlow and County Kilkenny rental market shows that there are a number of rental properties available within the prescribed limits.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met   and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs.</p></reply>

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  These changes are already provided for in legislation.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will then increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.</p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.  State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension.  It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.  The retirement condition associated with State pension transition has been criticised as a barrier to working.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that a significant number of people coming on to State pension (transition) in 2012 did not come from work as many were already on other social welfare schemes.  In December 2012, there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, just 12.5 per cent came from work with over 50 per cent coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers, indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age.  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65, all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.</p></reply>

The position is, however, that the requirements in regard to the proposed replacement of the bridge in question arise under the Planning and Development Acts. Galway County Council, as a planning authority, must meet the requirements of planning law, which, in regard to planning and development matters, transposes the EU Habitats Directive into Irish law. This requires competent authorities such as the Council to screen, and where necessary, assess projects such as this one for their impact on European nature sites.</p><p>  As Minister, I am a statutory consultee under the Planning and Development Acts and, in fulfilment of that role, my Department provides expert advice in regard to the relevant ecological issues relating to proposals such as this. The purpose of that advice is to assist planning authorities in meeting their obligations under national and EU law for the protection of nature.  My Department has provided advice to Galway County Council in regard to the proposed project and it is now a matter solely for the Council to ensure that it proceeds in compliance with the requirements of the Planning and Development Acts. I can assure the Deputy that my Department remains available to the Council should it require any further advice or clarification in relation to the matter.</p></reply>

Certain activities within these sites require consent from State authorities.  These include the granting of forestry consents by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and consent by planning authorities for developments such as wind-farms.  The granting of such consents must be done in compliance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive.</p><p>  Following a recorded decline in the numbers of breeding hen harriers in several of these SPAs, the EU Commission has expressed concerns in regard to how such consents relating to these sites have been assessed.  The issue of forestry consents has been subject to separate infringement proceedings under the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive.  In response to these developments, my Department has begun the process of formulating a hen harrier threat response plan under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 which will, among other things, explore possible ways forward that can meet the requirements of the EU Directives while providing assistance to consent authorities in how to meet their legal obligations regarding these sites.  It is hoped that the Plan, once finalised, will address the concerns voiced by landowners, users and other stakeholders and it is anticipated that it will address forestry, planning and farm-payment issues.</p></reply>

Reducing energy consumption remains the most cost-effective means of reducing Green House Gases and one of the primary means of achieving Ireland&rsquo;s climate change objectives. The NEEAP acts to underpin and extend the energy-related actions contained within the existing Climate Change strategy. NEEAP reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a 20% energy savings target across the economy by 2020. This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO2 emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt). Recognising that Government must lead by example, the Government is committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  The second Action Plan identifies realisable but ambitious actions across six areas: Public Sector, Residential, Business, Transport, Energy Supply, and Cross-Sectoral. The Plan contains 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.</p><p>  The anticipated energy and CO2 savings are distributed as follows:</p><p>  Energy savings (GWh) CO2 (kt CO2<table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>2010</th><th>2016</th><th>2020</th><th>2010</th><th>2016</th><th>2020</th></tr><tr><td>Public Sector</td><td>650</td><td>1,975</td><td>3,240</td><td>155</td><td>455</td><td>730</td></tr><tr><td>Business</td><td>2,505</td><td>4,340</td><td>5,820</td><td>620</td><td>1,025</td><td>1,330</td></tr><tr><td>Buildings</td><td>2,565</td><td>9,565</td><td>15,255</td><td>625</td><td>2,295</td><td>3,650</td></tr><tr><td>Mobility-Transport</td><td>630</td><td>3,295</td><td>5,330</td><td>160</td><td>840</td><td>1,360</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Supply</td><td>1,965</td><td>2,000</td><td>4,415</td><td>490</td><td>365</td><td>595</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>8,315</td><td>21,175</td><td>34,060</td><td>2,050</td><td>4,980</td><td>7,665</td></tr></table></p><p>  Government supports alone are unlikely to ensure that we fully achieve our energy saving targets by 2020 and a strong commitment from all sectors is imperative. NEEAP2 emphasised the role of market actors in facilitating the delivery of energy savings, with the introduction of energy saving targets for energy suppliers a key measure underpinning the delivery of the 2020 target. </p><p>  Should all measures detailed in the NEEAP reach their full potential by 2020 it is estimated that a potential reduction in energy spend across all sectors of approximately &euro;2.36 billion (at 2011 prices) would be realised.</p></reply>

The period between now and the close of the extended deadline will, no doubt, be useful in providing EirGrid with an opportunity to reflect further on the valid concerns raised in relation to various aspects of the project. If it emerges after 7 January that further steps need to be taken, then due consideration will be given at that point.</p><p>  The Programme for Government committed to the establishment of an independent international expert commission to review the case for, and cost of, undergrounding all or part of the Meath-Tyrone line. The Commission was appointed in July 2011 and its Report was published in January 2012.</p><p>  The July 2012 &quot;Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure&quot; emphasised the imperative for the State Companies, and all developers of energy projects, of early, transparent engagement and consultation with local communities and stakeholders. The Statement also made clear that public acceptability requires public confidence that proposals adhere to the highest international standards of safety, health and environmental and visual impact, and technology choice. The Government affirmed that EirGrid and the other State energy companies are obliged to adhere to all relevant guidelines and standards and they act in the national interest, and on behalf of all electricity consumers.</p><p>  In this regard, the expectation is that those companies in making their choices, of project specific technologies and routing as well as mitigation measures, will take account of all relevant national and international standards, to follow best practice and ensure value for money and be informed by detailed consultation at local level. In addition to undertaking extensive statutory and non statutory public consultation, the State Companies and energy developers must adhere to national and international standards on health, environment, biodiversity, landscape and safety as an intrinsic part of the Planning process.</p><p>  I am aware that many people are concerned about the immediate and longer term impact that new transmission lines and other energy infrastructure may have on the landscape, the environment and on local communities. Accordingly, it is essential that the GridLink project is taken forward on the basis of the best available knowledge and informed engagement on the impacts and costs of different engineering solutions. EirGrid has stated that it will take full account of all the submissions received during the course of the consultation process.</p><p>  Finally, it is important that the Government can give a strong consistent message to Irish business and multinationals, and our citizens, that Ireland&rsquo;s electricity networks are robust, modern and safe. EirGrid's transmissions projects are crucial in that regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-05a.389.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013120500068#WRN02300"><p>Ireland's telecommunications market has been fully liberalised since 1999 in accordance with the requirements of binding EU Directives. The provision of mobile telecommunications services networks within the competitive market is subject to a requirement to secure a wireless telegraphy licence to access the required radio spectrum. The award of such licenses, the imposition of terms and conditions to access that spectrum and the associated monitoring of compliance by licensed providers with those terms and conditions are matters for the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which is independent in the exercise of its functions. Accordingly, I have no statutory function in this matter. However, I expect that with the continued significant capital investments being made by mobile operators, the quality of mobile services will continue to improve across the country. I note in this regard that a number of mobile operators have made announcements regarding network upgrades. I can also confirm that the areas referred to by the Deputy are included in the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). The objective of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which was launched in 2008, following a competitive tendering process, was to provide access to affordable, scalable broadband services to rural areas, where operators had been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with &quot;3&quot;, the NBS service provider, the NBS mobile wireless service is required to offer minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1. The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  All persons located within the NBS Coverage Area can avail of the NBS service by contacting &quot;3&quot;, the NBS Service Provider on 1800 944 791, online at  or by calling into one of 3&rsquo;s authorised retail outlets.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, there is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan. eircom has extended its plans for the rollout of high speed services, with speeds of up to 100Mbps to 1.4m premises, UPC has increased its minimum and top speed products to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively, and mobile operators are rolling out enhanced product offerings, including 4G mobile. Other operators continue to invest and ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services.</p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators.</p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

This process was led by Bord G&aacute;&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann and overseen by a Government Steering Group which included officials from my Department, the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance and the NewERA unit of the NTMA.I am advised that the process was conducted in a professional, open and transparent manner and attracted significant interest from a broad range of potential international acquirers, reflecting the positive international sentiment towards Ireland. However, based on clear advice, I have determined that the three bids received were not a fair reflection of the strength and potential of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business. On November 27 last, I announced that I had confirmed to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann that none of the final bids received for the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business were of an acceptable value.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have been clear from the outset of this process that Bord G&aacute;is Energy would only be sold if a sale price was achieved which fully recognises the inherent value of the business. This decision underlines our commitment to proceed with asset disposals only when we are satisfied with the outcome.</p><p>  My Department, along with NewERA, will now work with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to ensure continued investment in and development of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business.</p><p>  On Wednesday last, the Oireachtas passed the final stage of the Gas Regulation Bill, which underpins the restructuring of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the sale of the energy business.

Under Statutory Instrument No. 445 of 2000 Eirgrid, the Transmission System Operator (TSO), is obliged to operate and ensure the maintenance and development of a safe, secure, reliable, economical and efficient electricity transmission system. As the TSO, EirGrid is responsible for managing electricity supply and demand in real time and controlling flows of power on the transmission system. Wind is afforded priority dispatch by the system operator in line with the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC. Thus, when wind is available, it is dispatched first onto the transmission system. When wind is low, other generation sources are used. These are gas, coal, hydroelectricity, peat, oil, diesel distillate and other smaller sources such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP); in addition, there are potential imports of up to 500 MW over the East West Interconnector. To ensure that this is done in an economic and efficient manner, EirGrid employs a unit commitment schedule to determine the dispatch order of other generation. The unit commitment schedule is determined based on the commercial and technical parameters submitted by generators on a daily basis. The commercial parameters submitted by generators must be cost reflective as per the bidding code of practice rules, which form part of the Single Electricity Market (SEM) rules. The unit commitment schedule establishes the most economic order for dispatching the generation needed to meet electricity demand. The cheapest generation type is dispatched first, then the next cheapest and so on until the system operator has enough generation to meet demand.In general, when wind is high and available to the power system, the production costs in the market are lower.  </p></reply>

This levy, which only applies to sites in urban areas, allows local authorities to apply an annual levy of 3 per cent of the market value of the derelict, but potentially developable, site in question subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The levy has proven difficult to apply in practice as the non-development of the sites in question may be due to factors outside the control of the site owner. </p><p>  With regard to the availability of land for housing development in the Dublin area, a recent data gathering exercise conducted by my Department indicated that there is already appropriate residential zoning of land for upwards of 30,000 new homes in the Dublin region, across the four Dublin local authorities.

These specify requirements in relation to a range of matters such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their properties comply with the regulations; however, responsibility for the enforcement of the minimum standards regulations rests with the local authorities supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). </p><p>  It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the specific details of its enforcement strategy and inspection arrangements. However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the <i>Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement</i>   published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which make recommendations on relevant issues, including the targeting of inspection activities. </p><p>  Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened, updated regulatory framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations. Fines for continuing non-compliance with the regulations were also increased significantly. While I expect that the large majority of landlords will comply with local authorities&rsquo; directions in the area of standards, the legal sanctions available to local authorities are an important aspect of enforcement and I would encourage local authorities to use them where landlords have failed to comply with directions. </p><p><b></b>PRTB registrations at the end of 2012 indicate that there are just over 260,000 registered properties for private rental in Ireland. Since 2005, over 130,000 inspections have been carried out by local authorities on properties in the sector.   </p><p>  The Government is acutely aware of the importance of having a robust private rented sector which provides good quality accommodation and protection for tenants. On 1 February 2013, regulations 6, 7 and 8 of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 came into effect for all residential rented accommodation. This means that all rental accommodation must have its own separate sanitary facilities leading to the phasing-out of the traditional &lsquo;bed-sit&rsquo;, where sanitary facilities are shared between different rental units. The Regulations allowed a four year phasing-in period to facilitate any improvement works that needed to be carried out.  </p><p>  The revised standards do not specifically target bed-sits but were based on a review of minimum standards dating back to 1993 which allowed external toilets, cold water only and having an open fireplace as the only heating source. The new standards were made in consultation with key stakeholders including organisations representing landlords and tenant rights, such as the Irish Property Owners Association and Threshold.  </p><p>  I am confident that targeted inspection activity and effective follow-up action where there is non-compliance will continue to improve the quality of the stock in the rented sector and I urge all landlords to ensure that their dwellings are in compliance with the regulations.     </p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is optimised in terms of resources and focus to maximise the response to social housing need.  This must be achieved in a context in which public expenditure necessarily continues to be constrained.  Nonetheless, in July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.</p><p>  In addition to the &euro;525.8 million in housing programme expenditure provided for in my Department&rsquo;s Abridged Estimate for 2014, Budget 2014 provides a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million for the State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and an additional &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in 2014 in the delivery of social housing and in particular in their capacity to attract external financial investment.</p><p>  In spite of our challenging economic circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will also be provided for social housing in 2014.</p></reply>

Article 5 of the Regulations provides for the permissible disposal of waste by burning under certain conditions, including, <i>inter alia</i>, where the material to be burned consists of &ldquo;<i>uncontaminated (free of dangerous substances, preservatives or other artificial impregnation or coating) wood, trees, tree trimmings, leaves, brush, or other similar waste generated by agricultural practices, but excluding garden and park wastes and cemetery wastes and wastes arising from infrastructural development works, provided that such burning is done as a final measure following the application of the following waste hierarchy&rdquo;</i>.</p><p><i>  Article 6 of the Regulations provides a sunset clause for this exemption as of 1 January 2014, unless </i>an application is made for a Certificate of Registration under the Facility Permit Regulations in relation to the activity in question before that date.</p><p>  It has been brought to my attention recently that the interactions between this exemption and certain provisions of the Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) Regulations 2007 (in relation to activities to which a certificate of registration may apply) and the inclusion of burning of waste as either a recovery or disposal operation under the Waste Management Act 1996 (as amended) require further clarification before the exemption expires.  It is my intention therefore to extend the existing exemption for a further period beyond 1 January 2014 by way of amending regulations to allow for further consideration of the matter.</p></reply>

On 28 November, I published a consultation document on the regulation of household waste collection to guide the development of a new regulatory regime to strengthen and improve the regulation of household waste collection. Our approach to pricing structures is a significant focus in the consultation paper. I want to ensure that waste management companies operate pricing structures that incentivise environmentally sustainable behaviour in terms of waste reduction and segregation. The consultation document is intended to facilitate a dialogue with the public and key stakeholders, including representatives from the waste industry, statutory bodies such as local authorities, the EPA, the National Transfrontier Shipment Office, environmental NGOs and others. Following the 8-week consultation process, which ends on 31 January 2014, I will consider the submissions received and develop proposals for a package of regulatory reform of household waste collection in Ireland. <font color="#333333"> </font>Ultimately, however, charges applied by waste management companies are a matter between those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation.</p></reply>

It was therefore necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the Local Development Companies (LDCs), taking into account the level of commitments already entered into.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and have been informed by the Courts Service that data is not captured in such a way as to provide the information sought by the Deputy.  I am advised by the Courts Service that under Section 32 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 the Injuries Board issues authorisations to bring court proceedings, in respect of a wide range of personal injuries including trip and fall incidents, accidents in the workplace as well as road traffic collision cases. These authorisations do not state the category of case for which the authorisation is issued. In addition the Injuries Board is required under the Act to issue an authorisation whether it is the claimant/applicant who refuses to accept the settlement offer, or whether the defendant refuses to accept the assessment. The authorisation does not indicate which party refused the assessment.</p></reply>

The remit of the Bureau is to target those persons who seek to derive benefit from criminal activities. In carrying out this role, the Bureau utilises all available legal remedies, primarily those contained in the Proceeds of Crime legislation, Taxes legislation and Social Welfare legislation, to deprive persons of benefits obtained from the proceeds of crime.  Since its inception, Bureau processes have been continuously evaluated and, where necessary, strengthened to maximise the number of cases brought and assets targeted.   Furthermore, an Expert Group, established under the auspices of my Department, is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the Proceeds of Crime legislation with a view to identifying possible improvements which would serve to strengthen the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau. A number of matters are being reviewed by the Group including decreasing the amount of time which must elapse before criminal assets which have been frozen become the property of the State; increasing the powers of receivers over properties so as to immediately deprive criminals of the use of those properties; short term seizure of assets believed to be the proceeds of crime pending determination by the courts and further improving measures supporting international cooperation. The work of the Group is not limited to these matters and any further proposals which the Bureau may bring forward which would serve to strengthen its operation can be taken into account during the review.</p></reply>

In both 2012 and 2013, these resources were supplemented by seven temporary clerical officers working in the Navan offices for up to three months to deal with the now annual issuance and renewal of licences in the sectors regulated by the Authority.  I understand my Department and the Authority will be looking to provide a similar seasonal increase to the PSRA's resources in 2014. </p><p>  My Department, the Authority and the Property Registration Authority of Ireland (PRAI) agreed in 2012, to allow for the operation of the first year of registration and licencing, that resources of the PRAI based in Roscommon were made available to the PSRA on a loan basis so that the once-off surge in activity associated with this phase of the PSRA's activities could be managed effectively within the constraints on public service numbers. </p><p>  My Department is in receipt of a detailed business case from the PSRA setting out its long term resource requirements and I understand my Department has indicated its commitment to providing the appropriate and necessary resources either directly or on a contracted basis having regard, in particular, to pressures on public service staff numbers and competing demands.  I am advised that in the current quarter, a Dublin based office has been established through the redeployment of staff from elsewhere in the Department and by year end this office will have over five full time equivalents.  In addition to this, I am further advised that through redeployments and transfers from within the Department and Justice Group, it is expected that the Navan office will receive a further three staff members.  Therefore, including the assignments proposed, the PSRA staff allocation is expected to grow from just over ten full-time equivalents earlier this year to almost nineteen full time equivalents by early next year. </p><p>  A key role of the Authority is to set and enforce standards in the provision of property services by auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents and to provide redress mechanisms for consumers of those services.  Under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, the Authority is empowered to investigate complaints made against property service providers and to initiate investigations for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the law.  Any person may make a complaint, in writing, to the Authority against a property service provider in relation to the provision of a property service provider in the course of providing a property service. </p><p>  Having regard to the staffing resources available, there has been for some time a backlog in the handling of complaints by the Authority and I am advised that to date the Authority has received of the order of 330 complaints.  With the introduction of additional staff resources to the Authority during November, I understand that there has been a specific focus on addressing complaints.  With further staff resources to be allocated to the Authority shortly, this should allow for further work in this regard. Notwithstanding this, the Authority has advised that it is not possible to indicate a specific timeframe for the investigation of any individual complaint, since the length of time it take to investigate a complaint will be dependent on the specific circumstances of each case.</p></reply>

It was based on an e-survey consultation that was sent to over 800 stakeholders in Ireland, including officials in my Department, from which he received detailed responses from 100 respondents. Following the compilation of this document, it was then disseminated to the stakeholders contacted initially. Further information is available at .</p><p>  Since then, my Department established the industry based Agri Research Expert Advisory Group (AREA), chaired by Matt Dempsey. The AREA group developed a national strategic research agenda for agri- production research entitled &lsquo;Stimulating Sustainable Agricultural Production through Research and Innovation&rsquo; in 2011. This agenda has guided my Department&rsquo;s last two research calls and contains a chapter dedicated to Crops research.</p><p>  The question of the continued operation of Teagasc activities in particular locations is an operational matter for Teagasc. They have decided that Kinsealy is no longer a strategic centre for the organisation given that they also operate from sites in Ashtown and the Botanic Gardens. The move from Kinsealy to Ashtown will allow Teagasc optimize the usage of this Centre where excellent facilities have been developed in recent years. Teagasc believe that they can adequately support the horticultural industry from Ashtown and the Botanic Gardens and through closer co-operation with producer clients to undertake specific research at their facilities.</p><p>  I believe that the horticulture sector benefited from the merger of Bord Glas with Bord Bia in 2004. It provided Irish horticulture producers access to the wide network of skilled and professional marketing expertise available in Bord Bia offices. The success of this approach is very evident in the range of marketing, promotion and development activities that Bord Bia carry out in support of and in conjunction with the Horticultural Industry on the domestic and export market. An example of this activity is Bord Bia&rsquo;s annual organisation of Bloom in the Phoenix Park which attracts over 100,000 people and is an event that provides an important platform for the horticultural industry to exhibit and promote its products and services.</p><p>  The College of Horticulture in Warrenstown, County Meath was a private college, owned and managed by the Salesians of Don Bosco. The decision to close the college in 2009 was taken by the College owners following lengthy discussions and consultation between the Trustees and Teagasc. A process was then successfully put in place to transfer Teagasc supported staff and education programmes in Warrenstown to the College of Amenity Horticulture in the Botanic Gardens. This College is currently being upgraded with new classrooms and student accommodation facilities.</p><p>  New facilities were also opened in Kildalton College in 2009 following a &euro;4m capital investment. The allocation of staff resources to Kildalton is an operational matter for Teagasc. I understand that staffing levels have been static at the College for a number of years.</p></reply>

Following two devastating collapses of the Celtic Sea Herring Fishery, the recovery plan identified the special area known as the &ldquo;Dunmore Box&rdquo; as an important area for herring reproduction. The Sentinel fishery was established in order to have a small fishery which would act as a sentinel or  indicator of the state of the overall herring stock in the area.</p><p>  In 2011, I asked the fishing industry and other interested parties to make proposals on the future management arrangements for all Irish herring fisheries, the Celtic Sea stock, the stocks off the North West coast and the Atlanto Scandian stock. The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.</p><p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believe met the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.</p><p>  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.  The review increased the proportion of the overall  proportion of fish which could be caught in the sentinel fishery from 8% to 11%. The outcome of the rebuilding plan has meant that the overall Celtic Sea herring quota has increased from a low of 6,000 tonnes in 2009 to a possible quota of over 19,000t for 2014. In real terms this means that between the review and rebuilding plan there will be an increase in quota for the Sentinel fishery from 480t in 2009 to a possible 2090t in 2014.</p><p>  The decisions I made during the review were based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years and is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries, which I believe it is delivering and I do not intend to revisit this policy.</p></reply>

The Project Team is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from seven other Government Departments, our co-funders The Atlantic Philanthropies as well as two organisations, Pobal and the Centre for Effective Services, which have been designated to manage the programme on behalf of my Department.</p><p>  Under the evaluation process, the Galway Early Education proposal was not deemed to have scored sufficiently highly against the programme criteria to be invited to proceed at this point to the next stage of development and design work.  While the ranking was good, it was not, I regret, sufficiently high to be among the proposals selected in what was a very competitive process.  The conclusions of the Project Team have been noted by the Government.</p><p>  As the Galway Early Education proposal was one of a number that showed promise against the criteria set for the programme, my Department has invited Galway Early Education  to continue to work in association with it by participating in a mentoring programme in the implementation of evidence-based programmes to improve outcomes for children and young people.  My Department will develop the mentoring programme during 2014 in conjunction with the Centre for Effective Services and will be in contact with Galway Early Education then.</p></reply>

The HSE&rsquo;s Internal Audit Directorate undertook a detailed review of remuneration in these agencies.  This review was concluded in March 2013 and identified a significant number of cases in which senior personnel were in receipt of additional payments outside the terms of the approved pay scales. The agencies which were audited are voluntary hospitals and disability organisations and the audit does not relate to employees of the HSE.  </p><p>  On 27 September 2013 my Department issued a pay policy, prepared following consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to the HSE.

On foot of this, on 21 May 2012 the HSE wrote to all Section 38 organisations, seeking comprehensive information on any supplementary payments being made to senior managers within their organisations.  In early June 2012 the HSE informally briefed my Department on the initial responses received.  Among the information conveyed in that context was that the CRC had indicated that the CEO of the organisation was in receipt of substantial payments in excess of the approved salary for the post.  Following analysis of the organisations' responses, the HSE's Internal Audit Directorate was requested to examine in detail the nature of any supplementary remuneration arrangements in Section 38 agencies and the extent to which these were the subject of official approval. </p><p>  The HSE has robustly and effectively investigated all the relevant matters and, with the support of my Department, will take all necessary steps to ensure compliance with Government pay policy.  The HSE will furnish me with further progress reports in due course following full and fair procedures.</p></reply>

Accordingly, all expenditure headings are being scrutinised. The funding that is available must be balanced across all of the various service areas in a way that achieves the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritises areas of greatest need as far as possible. </p><p>  The needs of our older people are, and will remain, a very high priority for me and for the Government, and the resources that ultimately are available will be applied to provide the best possible mix of supports and services.</p></reply>

I expect the panel to be in position to present their initial findings by year end with the successful projects to be announced by the end of January 2014.</p><p>  It's worth noting that Kerry County Council already received funding of &euro;50,000 from my Department in June this year under the National Cycle Network Seed Finance Scheme.  This funding was used to appoint specialist engineering consultants to carry out a structural assessment as well as a geotechnical assessment of the ground conditions on the elevated sections of the proposed route . </p><p>  The provision of ducting for broadband is not within my remit but is more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p></reply>
