    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-05a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070500074#WRA00900"><p>This Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the resources required to carry out the organisation&rsquo;s duties and this is evidenced by the increased allocation of resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent times. Some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution and allocation of Garda resources.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government is to support investment in CCTV systems at key locations along the road network and in urban centres. This commitment is being progressed in a number of ways, including in particular through the Community CCTV grant-aid scheme administered by my Department.</p><p>The intention is to support local communities who wish to install CCTV systems in their localities, including access roads to their areas where necessary and appropriate. Under the scheme, which is being administered by my Department, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000. Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - .</p><p>That scheme supplements the existing network of CCTV Systems in operation in the State including both existing Garda and Community based CCTV schemes. For example, there are some 35 Garda CCTV schemes in operation throughout the State comprising some 523 cameras.  There are also some 45 Community-based CCTV schemes in operation encompassing some 367 cameras to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have access, established under the previous grant-aid scheme funded by my Department between 2005 and 2013.</p><p>Joint Policing Committees play an important role in the establishment of Community CCTV schemes - indeed their approval is one of the statutory requirements for establishment of any community CCTV scheme.  In this regard the Deputy may find it useful to engage with his local Joint Policing Committee. </p><p>In addition to the Community CCTV scheme and as the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda Safety Camera Contract, GoSafe will provide an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying vehicle speed across 1,031 designated safety camera zones. </p><p>Further, Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology is fitted in a number of official Garda vehicles which are allocated around the country and used on a daily basis to assist in the prevention and detection of crime, particularly on our roads network. </p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021 (&quot;MRP&quot;) has identified a number of areas for expansion of ANPR including:</p><p>- increasing the number of ANPR units deployed;</p><p>- the addition of more &lsquo;watch-lists&rsquo; in order to remove a greater number of dangerous drivers and defective vehicles from the roads;</p><p>- examining the introduction of fixed ANPR sites at strategic locations across the roads network, in addition to using portable ANPR units while patrolling;</p><p>- working with the National Roads Authority, Port Authorities, Local Authorities and private car park operators in order to access data from their ANPR systems, as well as CCTV systems operating on the motorway network.</p><p>The MRP also sets out key strategic objectives for road policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's road policing plans over the next 5 years. Under the Programme, the Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints.</p><p>Finally and more generally, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that Garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24/7 basis. Some &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million under the Government's Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to utilise appropriate technologies in delivering professional policing and security services for the community.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-05a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070500074#WRA01300"><p>I should say at the outset that the distribution of Garda personnel is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Kildare Division was 365. There are also 18 Garda Reserves and 30 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>As I have stated in the House on other occasions the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 93 members have been assigned to the Kildare<b></b>Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the increase in Garda numbers last year represented the first significant increase since numbers started falling in 2009 and this has driven the level of recruitment that has seen the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Kildare Division increased from 301 to 365, an increase of 64 or 21% as of 31 May, the latest dates for which figures are readily available, as compared to the end of 2014.</p><p>Funding is in place to ensure that the 2021 vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the investment in resources and the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources to all Garda Divisions, including the Kildare Division in the coming years.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. While not all Garda Stations are training stations it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p><p>By way of assistance to the Deputy, I have set out in the table the number of new Garda Recruits allocated to the Kildare Division in each of the years 2015 and to date in 2018 as supplied by the Commissioner.</p><p><b>Probationer Garda Allocations by Division - 2015 to 2018</b><table><tr><th><b>DIVISION</b></th><th><b>2015</b></th><th><b>2016</b></th><th><b>2017</b></th><th><b>2018</b></th><th><b>Total </b></th></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>14</td><td>19</td><td>47</td><td>5</td><td>85</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-05a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070500074#WRA01700"><p>I should say at the outset that the distribution of Garda personnel is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. </p>  <p>  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. That is why it is important to recognise that the role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  A major programme of reform is already underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In July 2016, the Government approved a major Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which agreed to an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the full-time workforce in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in effect doubling the civilian staff count over the term of the programme. This is to be achieved through twin policies of "civilian by default" and redeployment. "Civilian by default" refers to the filling of new posts other than operational policing posts and non-operational policing posts that become vacant by civilian staff unless policing expertise is required. </p>  <p>  The redeployment element is informed by the Garda Inspectorate's 2015 "Changing Policing in Ireland" report which estimated that approximately 1,500 administrative and technical roles currently undertaken by Garda&iacute; may be suitable for civilianisation subject to further examination. The Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to policing duties over the next five years, to ensure a visible policing presence on the frontline and to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Progress is being made in relation to civilianisation with almost 300 new civilian posts approved to date. The bulk of these posts are aimed at addressing critical skills gaps and capacity issues across the organisation, with a proportion approved to make a start on the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties. Progress is also being made in relation to redeployment with the latest figures to the end of May indicating over 100 Garda members have been redeployed to policing roles. I have made it clear to the Commissioner that I expect progress in this area to continue and accelerate.</p>  <p>  As I have stated in the House on other occasions the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the increase in Garda numbers last year represented the first significant increase since numbers started falling in 2009. Undoubtedly, the investment in resources and the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources to all Garda Divisions in the coming years.</p></reply>

However, EU-wide the relocation mechanism only succeeded in registering and relating  35,000 people of the original 160,000 envisaged under the relevant EU instruments.  This meant that the relocation mechanism was unable to provide to Ireland the numbers that had been allocated to this country.</p>  <p>  As the EU relocation instruments were legal in nature, Ireland had to wait until the expiry of these instruments before seeking to fill the gap in numbers using other mechanisms. Ireland has since done so by making additional pledges for programme refugees and providing a new mechanism for family reunification under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme Humanitarian Admission Programme (IHAP).</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charles Flanagan, T.D. has pledged to select a further 945 refugees from Lebanon between 2018 and 2019.  Of these, 345 will be selected this year and the remainder in 2019.  IHAP will also provide for the admission of up to 530 immediate family members of Irish citizens, persons with convention refugee or subsidiary protection status and persons with programme refugee status.  I understand the first call for proposals, which ended on 30 June 2018, was well subscribed and these will be examined by Departmental officials to see if they meet the programme&rsquo;s criteria in the coming months.  Two further calls for proposals are planned for this year and additional calls may be announced in 2019.</p>  <p>  Any remaining shortfall in numbers will be filled by Ireland using a variety of mechanisms.</p></reply>

It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. That is why it is important to recognise that the role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  By way of assistance to the Deputy, I am informed by the Commissioner that on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available the strength of the Cork City Division, was 678 of whom 28 are designated as Community Garda. I am also advised that the strength of the Cork North Division was 324 of whom 5 are designated as Community Garda and the strength of the Cork West Division was 297 of whom 4 are designated as Community Garda. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  As I have stated in the House on other occasions the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 53, 25 and 24 members have been assigned to the to the Cork City Division, Cork North Division and the Cork West Divisions respectively. In An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in total, taking account of retirements, numbers increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Rebuilding the organisation is underway providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across all Garda activities including Community Policing.</p></reply>

This report contained a number of recommendations to further strengthen the criminal justice and regulatory response to harm perpetrated online. There is a growing concern around the safety of individuals online, particularly young people. Negative behaviours such as cyber-bullying and distributing intimate images without consent are areas that need to be tackled. It was intended that my Department would bring forward legislative proposals to give effect to the criminal law aspects of the LRC report. However, due to competing legislative priorities, progress was not as rapid as I had hoped. </p>  <p>  In 2017, Deputy Howlin introduced a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill to address the same criminal law issues outlined in the 2016 LRC report. The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill completed second stage in the D&aacute;il in January 2018 and was not opposed by Government. I recently obtained cabinet approval to discontinue work on the Government Bill and to support Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Bill to ensure that legislation can be enacted as swiftly as possible. The main provisions of the Bill as published include extending the existing offence of sending threatening or indecent messages to apply to all threatening, false, indecent and obscene messages using any form of online or traditional method of communications. This is particularly relevant to the Deputy's question as this will criminalise sending threatening messages on any platform. </p>  <p>  The Bill also proposes extending the existing offence of harassment as contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 to include all forms of communication, including through online or digital communications.  </p>  <p>  My officials have arranged to meet with Deputy Howlin in the coming weeks with the intention of identifying and bringing forward any necessary Government amendments to ensure the Bill can be effective. Any further amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 can be considered at that juncture. I would of course be very happy to consider any proposals that Deputy Kenny, or indeed any Deputy might have in this regard, and I look forward to debating the provisions of the Bill on the floor of the House in due course.</p></reply>

Mr Harris will take up office for a period of five years commencing in September.</p><p>This is the first occasion that the independent Policing Authority has exercised its function in relation to the filling of this important position. I thank the Authority and the Public Appointments Service for their intensive work over the past ten months on this process. The selection process was an open, international one, designed with the objective of attracting the<b></b>widest possible pool of candidates from diverse backgrounds to ensure that the successful candidate would be tested against international standards in police leadership.<b></b>I understand it worked well in attracting a strong field of high calibre candidates. All those who put themselves forward were subject to robust scrutiny by an independent expert interview board which determined Mr Harris to be the best person for the office at this time.  </p><p>The incoming Commissioner will take up office at a time of major reform and investment which will redefine An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation. In addition, the start of his tenure will coincide with the publication of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland which will chart a new course for policing in the decades ahead. Mr Harris has the necessary ability and vital policing, security and change management experience required to lead An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this critical juncture. He will bring his talents to the challenge of transforming An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that it becomes a model of policing excellence, equipped to deal with the huge range of challenges facing police services worldwide.  He can be assured of my support and that of the Government in his endeavours. </p><p>In that regard I have indicated previously that the Government is open to the incoming Commissioner appointing a small personal team. Bearing in mind that senior roles in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and indeed across the public service, are required to be filled by way of transparent, competitive, merit-based processes, what has been suggested by the Policing Authority and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is that the incoming Commissioner could, if he wished to do so, appoint a small number of individuals on a temporary contractual basis to support him. I have no doubt that the Deputy would concur that the role of Commissioner is a very demanding one, not only in view of the policing and security environment, but also in view of the major reform programme underway and the impending report of the Commission. In such circumstances, the appointment of a small team of advisers could be a valuable support to the new Commissioner in dealing with the challenges of the role at this critical juncture, but this will ultimately be a matter for him to decide.</p><p>I want to reiterate, however, lest there be any confusion, senior positions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether sworn or unsworn, will continue to be made in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act and the Regulations governing such appointments.  What is in question here is the appointment of a small number of additional advisors on a contract basis to support the new Commissioner, if he so wishes.</p><p>I look forward to working with the incoming Commissioner on our shared objective of ensuring the security of the State and the safety of the public. I am sure that the Deputy and all members of this House will join me in wishing Mr Harris every success as Commissioner and assuring him of our support as he takes on this most challenging of roles.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-05a.39.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070500074#WRA03800"><p>During discussions on section 30 of the Data Protection Act 2018 in the Select Committee, and once again during Report Stage discussions, I pointed out that the processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called &ldquo;legitimate interests&rdquo; ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR, and that the Court of Justice had already addressed the issue of whether national law could impose additional conditions on processing carried on under the corresponding provision of the 1995 Data Protection Directive in Joined Cases C-468/10 and C-469/10. In its ruling, the Court of Justice had underlined the importance of free movement of personal data under the 1995 Directive and concluded that Member States were not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds in Article 7 of the Directive. Those grounds are now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General subsequently advised my Department that insofar as section 30 purports to make it an offence for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing or profiling, such a prohibition appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1)(f), read in conjunction with Recital (47). Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f). Since commencement of section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, I  requested my Department to clarify the matter with the European Commission. </p>  <p>  The European Commission have confirmed that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest and that Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR does not exclude processing for such purposes in relation to a child, but stresses the importance of balancing the legitimate interest of the controller with the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. The reference to a child in Article 6(1)(f) and recital (47) underlines that such assessment must be performed with particular care where personal data of a child are processed. They have pointed out that the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing is therefore not as such unlawful. They have also indicated that subject to Article 22 (automated decision-making), processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of profiling is not generally prohibited, albeit the processing must take into account that children merit specific protection as clarified in recital (38). Moreover, the European Commission have indicated that the term "micro-targeting" is not mentioned in the GDPR and that it is a concept unknown to the GDPR.  </p>  <p>  Apart from this apparent conflict with the GDPR, the Office of the Attorney General has pointed out that section 30 gives rise to difficulties under Article 38.1 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 38.1 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In order for a domestic offence provision to comply with Article 38.1, it must be clear, precise and foreseeable in its application.  This is not the case here since it is not clear what might constitute the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes micro-targeting.  Whereas the GDPR refers to both direct marketing and profiling, the concept of micro-targeting does not appear in the GDPR and its scope remains uncertain and undefined. It is also a requirement under Article 7 of the Convention that offence provisions must be sufficiently clear and precise so as to enable individuals to ascertain which conduct constitutes a criminal offence and to foresee the consequences of engaging in such conduct.   </p>  <p>  I hope that the preceding information will indicate to the Deputy that there are serious matters that require consideration, including in relation to the risk of infringement proceedings against Ireland, in the context of any commencement of section 30.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of personnel under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Cavan/Monaghan Division was 344. There are also 11 Garda Reserves and 39 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 62<b></b>members have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan<b></b>Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner ran a new recruitment drive last month. </p><p>In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.</p></reply>

Some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution and allocation of Garda resources.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government is to support investment in CCTV systems at key locations along the road network and in urban centres. This commitment is being progressed in a number of ways, including in particular through the Community CCTV grant-aid scheme administered by my Department.</p><p>The intention is to support local communities who wish to install CCTV systems in their localities, including access roads to their areas where necessary and appropriate. Under the scheme, which is being administered by my Department, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000. Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - .</p><p>That scheme supplements the existing network of CCTV Systems in operation in the State including both existing Garda and Community based CCTV schemes. For example, there are some 35 Garda CCTV schemes in operation throughout the State comprising some 523 cameras.  There are also some 45 Community-based CCTV schemes in operation encompassing some 367 cameras to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have access, established under the previous grant-aid scheme funded by my Department between 2005 and 2013.</p><p>Joint Policing Committees play an important role in the establishment of Community CCTV schemes - indeed their approval is one of the statutory requirements for establishment of any community CCTV scheme.  In this regard the Deputy may find it useful to engage with his local Joint Policing Committee. </p><p>In addition to the Community CCTV scheme and as the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda Safety Camera Contract, GoSafe will provide an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying vehicle speed across 1,031 designated safety camera zones. </p><p>Further, Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology is fitted in a number of official Garda vehicles which are allocated around the country and used on a daily basis to assist in the prevention and detection of crime, particularly on our roads network. </p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021 (&quot;MRP&quot;) has identified a number of areas for expansion of ANPR including:</p><p>- increasing the number of ANPR units deployed;</p><p>- the addition of more &lsquo;watch-lists&rsquo; in order to remove a greater number of dangerous drivers and defective vehicles from the roads;</p><p>- examining the introduction of fixed ANPR sites at strategic locations across the roads network, in addition to using portable ANPR units while patrolling;</p><p>- working with the National Roads Authority, Port Authorities, Local Authorities and private car park operators in order to access data from their ANPR systems, as well as CCTV systems operating on the motorway network.</p><p>The MRP also sets out key strategic objectives for road policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's road policing plans over the next 5 years. Under the Programme, the Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints.</p><p>Finally and more generally, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that Garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24/7 basis. Some &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million under the Government's Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to utilise appropriate technologies in delivering professional policing and security services for the community.</p></reply>

To date, there has been a good response from various civil and public service organisations, and the information received is being collated.</p><p>- The sub-committee to deal with the issue of the retention of Traveller and Roma children in education has met four times. At the meeting on 8 March 2018 it was agreed that a pilot project would be undertaken in each of the TUSLA Education Welfare Services regions &ndash; South/South East &ndash; Wexford, West/North West &ndash; Galway, North Dublin/North Leinster &ndash; North County Dublin and South Dublin/Kildare/West Wicklow &ndash; Tallaght, Clondalkin. Each area will have the additional resource of an Educational Welfare Officer (EWO), Home School Liaison Coordinator (HSCL) and 2 Traveller/Roma Education Workers. The team will work together with parents, children and young people, schools, Traveller and Roma communities and service providers to improve Traveller and Roma children&rsquo;s attendance, participation and retention in education.</p><p>- The third sub-committee was set up to deal with the problem of feuding in the Traveller Community, and has met three times. A proposal from the Traveller Mediation Service for addressing this issue through an expanded mediation service is currently being examined with a view to a possible increase in funding.</p><p>In addition to this information, I have asked my officials to forward the Deputy a detailed tabular report on progress on all of the actions in the NTRIS.</p></reply>

Reporting sexual violence is necessary in order to hold perpetrators to account. I fully appreciate that the criminal justice process can be daunting for victims and the review will examine what further supports can be given to complainants and witnesses in these cases, including legal protections. </p>  <p>  There are some legal supports already available to complainants. The Legal Aid Board currently provides free legal advice to a person who has made a complaint to the Garda&iacute; about rape and/or sexual assault, and in respect of which criminal proceedings have been initiated.

Garda management keeps this distribution of personnel under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise. For this reason, it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs at any given time. The material requested by the Deputy is, therefore, not available in the manner requested. </p><p>By way of assistance to the Deputy, I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Cork City Division in 2010 and on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available, was 698 and 678 respectively. There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 71 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cork City Division.

The Bureau has dedicated expert staff, including professional forensic accountants, to address white collar and other fraud and economic crimes, and includes the restructured Garda Cyber Crime Bureau, the Money-laundering Investigation Unit and a new Foreign Bribery and Corruption Unit. I am further informed by the Commissioner that as of 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are available there were 68 Garda and 17 Garda civilian staff assigned to the GNECB.  Garda  management continue to review the needs of the Bureau to enable it to fully realise to the aims of the MRP and to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maximises it capability to investigate emerging forms of economic crime.</p>  <p>  I published the Garda Inspectorate &ldquo;Review of Entry Routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo; last Thursday, which proposes tailored approaches to the creation of new entry routes into the Organisation up to Assistant Commissioner level. The Review is a valuable resource for policy development to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to attract the best possible candidates and to broaden and diversify the Garda workforce, so that it reflects the composition of the communities it serves. The Inspectorate proposes in its Review is that a programme be developed to recruit experienced police officers from police services in other jurisdictions. I have sent the Review to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to consider in the context of its forthcoming Report which will bring forward to Government proposals on the future of policing including on the appropriate composition and recruitment methods and routes into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Mr Harris will take up office for a period of five years commencing in September.</p><p>This is the first occasion that the independent Policing Authority has exercised its function in relation to the filling of this important position. I thank the Authority and the Public Appointments Service for their intensive work over the past ten months on this process. The selection process was an open, international one, designed with the objective of attracting the<b></b>widest possible pool of candidates from diverse backgrounds to ensure that the successful candidate would be tested against international standards in police leadership.<b></b>I understand it worked well in attracting a strong field of high calibre candidates. All those who put themselves forward were subject to robust scrutiny by an independent expert interview board which determined Mr Harris to be the best person for the office at this time.  </p><p>The incoming Commissioner will take up office at a time of major reform and investment which will redefine An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation. In addition, the start of his tenure will coincide with the publication of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland which will chart a new course for policing in the decades ahead. I am confident that Mr Harris has the necessary ability and vital policing, security and change management experience require to lead An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this critical juncture. He will bring his talents to the challenge of transforming An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that it becomes a model of policing excellence, equipped to deal with the huge range of challenges facing police services worldwide.  </p><p>I look forward to working with the incoming Commissioner on our shared objective of ensuring the security of the State and the safety of the public. I am sure that the Deputy and all members of this House will join me in wishing Mr Harris every success as Commissioner and assuring him of our support as he takes on this most important of roles.</p></reply>

Represented at the meeting were the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Housing, Planning and Local Government; and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Road Safety Authority; and the Revenue Commissioners.  A separate meeting also took place with a representative from Dublin City Council on 23 April.</p>  <p>  I asked my officials to arrange these consultations to identify whether there are additional legislative or other solutions which can assist in dealing with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes more comprehensively. I am informed that at this meeting, the issue of the misuse of scramblers within public parks was a particular point of focus.</p>  <p>  My officials are now consulting further with local authorities in the context of the many examples of positive engagement fostered by local authorities with local communities, as a number of initiatives and projects are of potential interest insofar as the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes are concerned.</p>  <p>  In the context of this engagement with local authorities, the Department recently participated in the first meeting of a newly established taskforce consisting of representatives of the Dublin local authorities, local Garda&iacute;, and professional motocross sports. I understand that an invitation was also extended to local authorities from Meath and Wicklow to join this taskforce. At the taskforce meeting, the consensus was that a multi-pronged approach to tackling this issue is necessary, to include a consideration of enforcement, education and awareness-raising, relevant legislation, and the potential provision of designated facilities, where such vehicles could be used in a safe environment.</p>  <p>  Following on from this meeting, officials in my Department are currently reviewing appropriate criminal justice legislation in order to ensure that Garda&iacute; have the necessary powers at their disposal in order to deal with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes. The Department will also continue to liaise with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority in relation to a planned campaign to discourage parents from purchasing these vehicles as gifts for minors. I would emphasise that the supply of mechanically propelled vehicles to persons under 16 and 17 (depending on the vehicle) constitute offences under accordance with Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act 2004. I might add that the RSA targets road safety awareness campaigns at young people throughout the school curriculum. </p>  <p>  I will continue to actively support any positive actions that can be pursued to counteract the serious public safety issues associated with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Meath Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 310. There are also 16 Garda Reserves and 30 Garda civilian staff attached to the Meath Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 64 members have been assigned to the Meath Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Meath Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.</p></reply>

The recommendations contained in the report are being progressed under the direction of a Detective Superintendent attached to the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.  Implementation of the recommendations is a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Child Protection Unit has been tasked with ensuring that all the recommendations are assessed, evaluated and actioned.</p></reply>

The programme provides non-EEA national investors with options to invest in Ireland. The criteria for the programme are that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest. </p>  <p>  The immigrant investor is required to make an investment of &euro;1 million in Irish projects for a minimum of three years and on confirmation of receipt of the investment, they receive Stamp 4 residency permission for an initial period of two years and which may thereafter be renewed for 3 years following a review. Any investor who withdraws their investment from a Fund or any other approved investment loses any immigration permission granted under the programme.</p>  <p>  I should point out that the Investment Fund Option under the IIP comprises around 10% of the overall Programme by which investors may invest in Ireland and obtain permission. All Fund applications submitted to the Evaluation Committee for consideration must, in the first instance, be in respect of a Fund approved and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland and must meet the published guidelines of the IIP programme.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Laois/Offaly Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 345. There are also 16 Garda Reserves and 25 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 82 members have been assigned to the Laois/Offaly Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Laois/Offaly Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to a vigorous and comprehensive response to burglary, theft and other property-related crime. Rural communities including those in the Laois/Offaly Division will benefit from the significant injection of policing resources provided by the Government and the concentrated anti-crime drive coordinated under Operation Thor. The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime under Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity. As of 17 May 2018, 130,702 targeted checkpoints and 151,819 crime prevention patrols have been conducted nationwide. To give you an idea of the impact of the Operation, I can inform you that this concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 7,569 arrests and 8,613 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p>  <p>  I want to reassure you that criminal gangs that target all areas of the country and prey on rural communities are continuously monitored and relentlessly targeted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are properly protected and supported. An &ldquo;Integrity at Work&rdquo; pledge and &ldquo;Integrity at Work Membership Agreement&rdquo; was signed by the Garda Commissioner and Transparency International Ireland on 4 October, 2017.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Code of Ethics includes very strong commitments in relation to 'Speaking Up and Reporting Wrongdoing'.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, in 2016 the then Minister requested the Policing Authority to examine and report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistle-blowers and whistleblowing. The Authority was also asked to make any recommendations that it considered appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistle-blowers can make complaints or allegations in a safe environment where their complaints or allegations are properly investigated. </p>  <p>  The Policing Authority completed its review and reported in November, 2016.  The Report was laid before both Houses in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p>  <p>  Taken together, I am satisfied that the comprehensive actions taken by this Government to support and protect those, including staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who make protected disclosures are having a real and positive impact.</p>  <p>  I have requested the data sought by the Deputy from the Garda Commissioner and I will forward it when it is available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-05a.117.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070500075#WRB04300"><p>The Deputy will be aware that I have already answered written questions on related matters in this House on the 3rd of July. GRECO recently produced a Fourth Round Evaluation Interim Compliance Report in relation to Ireland, on 22 June 2018 following the GRECO 80th Plenary meeting held in Strasbourg on 18-22 June. This Report had been produced in earlier drafts and we had been given the opportunity to comment on its draft conclusions, including by way of participating in the consideration of the report at the recent plenary.  The judiciary also furnished their observations directly to GRECO on the matter.  GRECO will publish the report following the authorisation of the Irish Government and my intention, subject to Government approval, is that this would happen today.</p><p>The recent Report specifically welcomed developments in relation to the Judicial Council Bill, which is at present in the course of passage through the other House and will be coming before this House in the autumn and referred to the role of the new Council in underpinning the independence of the judiciary</p><p>In relation to the Judicial Appointments Bill,  GRECO had expressed significant concerns regarding the proposed composition, in particular the minority of judges and a strong lay representation (including the chairperson). They had expressed a view in an earlier version of the report that in this regard the Bill is not in line with European standards.  In the report which will shortly be published, they removed their assertion that the Bill is not in line with European standards, instead questioning whether it is in line with European standards.  The GRECO views in this area are based on a Recommendation of the Council of Europe from 2010, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 2012, which among other things recommended a judicial appointments body &lsquo;drawn in substantial part from the judiciary&rsquo;.  GRECO states that the Bill, as far as the composition of the new body is concerned needs to reflect European standards, aiming at securing judicial independence, through more substantial judicial representation in  the overall composition. GRECO also refers to the need to limit the potential risks of improper influence from the executive/political power over the appointment process to the judiciary. Again, as the Deputy will be aware, amendments which I proposed to the D&aacute;il during the Report Stage had the effect of ensuring that the Presidents of the Circuit and District Courts were included in the membership of the Commission.</p><p>Senior officials from my Department attended the GRECO plenary meeting in Strasbourg on 18-22 June and questioned the view that the presence of the Chief Justice (as head of the Supreme Court) and the four other Presidents of Courts on the new Commission is anything other than a body &lsquo;drawn in substantial part from the judiciary.&rsquo;  The proposition that Ireland is not in line with European standards was also questioned in this regard since the  Council of Europe Recommendation relied on does not equate the term &lsquo;substantial part&rsquo; to a majority of judges or, indeed, half of the membership of such a body. It was also pointed out that the Recommendation itself specifies, in relation to countries which have judicial appointments bodies where the body does both selection and appointment of judges, that those bodies should be made up &lsquo;at least half&rsquo; of judges, thus not specifying a majority even in that case. It was also pointed out to the GRECO meeting that the 2010 Recommendation of the Council of Europe also sets specifically that the membership of judicial selection authorities should ensure the widest possible representation and that this is one of the reasons why the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 provides for a large cohort of lay members, carefully and independently selected according to very specific skills and experience criteria, by the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>There are no internationally binding norms in relation to the composition of judicial selection bodies. Other views have also been formally expressed in this area including in the ENCJ (European Network of Councils for the Judiciary) Dublin Declaration (2012) which stated that: &ldquo;The procedures for the recruitment, selection or (where relevant) promotion of members of the judiciary ought to placed in the hands of a body independent of government in which a relevant number of members of the judiciary are directly involved and that the membership of this body should comprise a majority of individuals independent of government influence.&rdquo;</p><p>I have already pointed out in the other House in recent days that the Judicial Appointments Bill in my view actually strengthens judicial independence by, among other things:</p><p>- providing for a<b></b>reduced number of names of nominees for judicial appointment to go to Government</p><p>- the inclusion of all judicial appointments in the new process including promotions of judges from one court to another which are at present done outside the existing Judicial Appointments Advisory Board</p><p>- reducing the role of Government in selection of the lay chairperson and members of the Commission which will now be done by PAS with PAS nominating the exact number of required appointees and the appointments being made only following affirming resolutions of the Houses of the Oireachtas</p><p>- the stipulation in the Bill that all appointments will be on merit; and</p><p>- the professionalization of the judicial selection process which will be delivered by the Bill. </p><p>GRECO also refers in the report to the matter of judicial independence and to its recommendation in its Fourth Round evaluation that an appropriate structure be established within which questions concerning constitutional safeguards of the judiciary in connection with employment conditions are to be examined.  GRECO makes reference in this context to links to the establishment of the Judicial Council and maintaining the high levels of independence of the judiciary and guaranteeing the respect of constitutional principles for judges. The Judicial Council Bill will shortly be progressing to Committee Stage in the Seanad.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that very significant resources have been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an overtime allocation of almost &euro;100 million announced in Budget 2018, to support large-scale policing operations including Operation Thor. </p><p>The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime under Operation Thor  has led to concentrated Garda activity. As of 17 May 2018, 130,702 targeted checkpoints and 151,819 crime prevention patrols have been conducted nationwide. To give you an idea of the impact of the Operation, I can inform you that this concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 7,569 arrests and 8,613 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p><p>I want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property-related crime. Such incidents cannot be tolerated in our society and this Government will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, who target rural areas, including Counties Roscommon and Longford.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Roscommon/Longford Garda Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available was 310. There are also 7 Garda Reserves and 32 Garda civilian staff attached to the Roscommon/Longford Garda Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>For its part, the Government remains totally committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our society, which includes actions taken under Operation Thor. Indeed, some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018. This is an increase of approximately 2% over the allocation for 2017. &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018 which represents an increase of &euro;10 million over the initial allocation for 2017 (which amounted to &euro;88.5 million). In November 2017, the Minister for Justice and Equality secured a supplementary estimate of some &euro;42 million for Garda overtime, bringing the spend for 2017 to over &euro;130 million. This compares to a spend in previous years of &euro;91 million in 2016, &euro;56 million in 2015 and some &euro;37.7 million in 2014. </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p><p>On 2 January 2018 I was pleased to announce that my Department will be providing an additional &euro;50,000 in financial support to Community Text Alert Groups as a further measure in this Government's support to crime prevention.  This is in addition to the &euro;100,000 which I announced at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017. The Rebate Scheme, which also ran in 2016, will allow Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for funding to contribute towards their yearly running costs.  The Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and I would like to urge groups wishing to participate in the Scheme to contact Muintir na T&iacute;re for more information.  The website is .</p><p>Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association.  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID (such as an EirCode) and then registered on a nationwide database. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that as part of the July 2016 Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has agreed an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians. This target is to be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect. These roles are to backfilled by suitably qualified civilians where necessary. </p><p>I have set out in the table the number of civilian staff by Division as of 31 May 2018. I am informed by the Commissioner that there were approximately 2,300 civilians overall within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as of that date.</p><p>I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is increasing. To date, almost 300 new civilian posts have been approved at the request of the Commissioner to address critical skills gaps and capacity issues across the organisation and to support the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties.  I am informed that as of 31 May over 100 Garda members  have  been  redeployed  to policing roles. </p><p>To drive momentum on this critical reform project Garda management has established a dedicated civilianisation project team in the Strategic Transformation Office. I understand that the team has reviewed the 2,055 posts  identified in the 2017 Organisation Deployment Survey undertaken by Garda management as potentially suitable for civilianisation and is currently focusing on some 400 of these for the early phases of the project. The project team has identified a number of guiding principles that will be taken into consideration when identifying roles for redeployment including selecting those who have spent the least amount of time in administrative roles first.  In addition, there must be regard, for example, to the reason that the member may be on administrative duties (e.g. recovering from an injury on duty, pregnancy etc) or that the member may require some refresher training before being reassigned to front-line policing. This approach is necessary to ensure that redeployment is handled in a manner that is fair to all involved.</p><p>To ensure that progress on civilianisation continues this year Budget 2018 has provided funding for up to 500 civilian staff. Civilianisation is a key element of the reform programme that is being pursued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It brings advantages in terms of a more diverse skillset, professionalisation of the organisation, cost savings and more visible policing.  It will not be done overnight but I have made it clear to the Commissioner that progress on achieving the target of 20% implementation must continue and, indeed, accelerate to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland.</p><p>Garda Civilian Staff by Division &ndash; May 2018<table><tr><th><b>Station</b></th><th><b>May-18</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>D.M.R.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-05a.137.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070500076#WRC00400"><p>On 27 June last the Government announced that we had successfully opted in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive. This is a major reform. In effect, when coupled with the programme of reform we have undertaken in recent years, it fundamentally alters the 'direct provision' system as we know it or as it has been described. </p>  <p>  As a Government we sought to address the various issues and established the McMahon group and have implemented its proposals. The International Protection Act was introduced which replaced the multi-layered application process down to a single application procedure which will bring certainty to applicants at a much earlier stage. Now, we have introduced measure which will enable applicants in the system without a first instance decision for nine months or more, to access the labour force under a broad and generous permission which will allow them to provide for themselves and live independently. Arising from the opt-in to the Directive, which encompasses a wide range of measures including relating to health, education and accommodation provisions, the system is now on a statutory basis, based on European norms and subject to independent inspection. As a result of these wide ranging reform measures, the current system of Direct Provision is simply not recognisable from that which existed a few short years ago.   </p>  <p>  In addition, a standards committee for the accommodation centres has been introduced and a cooking programme has been rolled out in many centres with over 1,500 residents now having access to independent cooking facilities. Residents also have access to the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children and a new free appeals process is introduced for issues relating to reception conditions. This is real and radical change. </p>  <p>  People who arrive in Ireland are immediately offered shelter, food, support services free healthcare and free education for children. There are no circumstances where the Government can consider ending such a system of humanitarian aid for vulnerable people. The debate on this issue has failed to produce a viable alternative in over a decade. </p>  <p>  No one is under any obligation to accept these immediate services though many must arising from their means. Approximately one in four of those currently who apply for protection succeed at first instance. The remainder of persons in the Accommodation centres are those who have received a negative first instance decision and have decided to appeal that decision. They are, as they are entitled to, availing of our appeals systems including the free legal advice and representation services which are the cornerstone of our protection process. Others in the Centres have a Deportation Order issued against them and are obliged to remove themselves from the State with a further cohort having received status. The significant increase in resources both for the International Protection Office and for the International Protection Appeals Tribunal will also assist length of stay in the Centres by reducing processing times.  </p>  <p>  The Government has approved a broad and generous access to the labour market for qualified applicants amongst a number of other important reforms in a range of areas covered by the Directive including reception conditions for applicants, improved identification of vulnerability and children&rsquo;s rights.  These measures are a further significant measure to deliver on the policy pursued in recent years to significantly reform our protection process.  </p>  <p>  Effective access to the labour market will help to alleviate social and economic exclusion for applicants and avoid long-term dependency on the State. Asylum seekers will have access to additional means to provide for themselves and their families outside of the State&rsquo;s directly provided services and supports while their application is being determined.  Moreover, Ireland is one of the few EU Member States to allow eligible asylum seekers to also engage in self-employment.  </p>  <p>  With our accommodation centres being put on a statutory basis, an applicant with sufficient earnings may choose to secure their own accommodation in the future. For those who will be granted protection, this will of course assist their early integration into our society and communities. For those who are found not to have a protection need, it provides an opportunity to receive an income, which will help them in their reintegration to their home country to rebuild their lives there.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that very significant resources have been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an overtime allocation of almost &euro;100 million announced in Budget 2018, to support large-scale policing operations including Operation Thor. </p>  <p>  The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime under Operation Thor  has led to concentrated Garda activity. As of 17 May 2018, 130,702 targeted checkpoints and 151,819 crime prevention patrols have been conducted nationwide. To give you an idea of the impact of the Operation, I can inform you that this concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 7,569 arrests and 8,613 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property-related crime. Such incidents cannot be tolerated in our society and this Government will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, who target rural areas, including County Wexford.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Wexford Garda Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available was 293. There are also 17 Garda Reserves and 32 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  For its part, the Government remains totally committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our society, which includes actions taken under Operation Thor. Indeed, some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018. This is an increase of approximately 2% over the allocation for 2017. &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018 which represents an increase of &euro;10 million over the initial allocation for 2017 (which amounted to &euro;88.5 million). In November 2017, the Minister for Justice and Equality secured a supplementary estimate of some &euro;42 million for Garda overtime, bringing the spend for 2017 to over &euro;130 million. This compares to a spend in previous years of &euro;91 million in 2016, &euro;56 million in 2015 and some &euro;37.7 million in 2014. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p>  <p>  On 2 January 2018 I was pleased to announce that my Department will be providing an additional &euro;50,000 in financial support to Community Text Alert Groups as a further measure in this Government's support to crime prevention.  This is in addition to the &euro;100,000 which I announced at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017. The Rebate Scheme, which also ran in 2016, will allow Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for funding to contribute towards their yearly running costs.  The Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and I would like to urge groups wishing to participate in the Scheme to contact Muintir na T&iacute;re for more information.  The website is www.muintir.ie.</p>  <p>  Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association.  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID (such as an EirCode) and then registered on a nationwide database. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. </p></reply>

Under this timetable, and subject to passage of the necessary Bills by the Houses of the Oireachtas and formal confirmation of the polling date, it is proposed to hold referendums in October 2018 on the offence of blasphemy (Article 40.6.1&deg;1) and on a woman's life within the home (Article 41.2). Commitments to hold these referendums are included in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p>  <p>  The necessary preparatory work to facilitate the holding of these referendums is now drawing to a close within my Department.</p>  <p>  In relation to blasphemy, that work has involved an assessment of the various options which exist in relation to the nature of the question which should be put to the people. The Government gave approval on 12 June for the holding of a Referendum to amend the Constitution to provide for the removal of the offence of blasphemy, and for the drafting of the required Constitution Amendment Bill. I expect to be in a position to publish that Bill in the very near future.</p>  <p>  The issue of the provision on &ldquo;a woman's life within the home&rdquo; is being examined by my Department in collaboration with other relevant Departments and the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to determining the best legal approach as regards the question to be put to the people. </p>  <p>  More generally, funding arrangements have been put in place within my Department and contact has been maintained with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Office of the Ombudsman, both of which will have key roles to play in relation to the Referendum process. In addition, the timely publication of both Bills will allow for the early establishment of Referendum Commissions and will ensure that the Commissions will have adequate time within which to begin their preparatory work.</p></reply>

As Commissioner, Mr Harris will have the full functions of that role including safeguarding the security of the State. On taking up office in September he will, like all entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, make a solemn declaration under section 16 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the State.</p><p>This is the first occasion that the independent Policing Authority has exercised its function in relation  to the filling of this important position. I thank the Authority and the Public Appointments Service for their intensive work over the past ten months on this process. The selection process was an open, international one, designed with the objective of attracting the<b></b>widest possible pool of candidates from diverse backgrounds to ensure that the successful candidate would be tested against international standards in police leadership.<b></b>I understand it worked well in attracting a strong field of high calibre candidates. All those who put themselves forward were subject to robust scrutiny by an independent expert interview board which determined Mr Harris to be the best person for the office at this time.  </p><p>The incoming Commissioner is a person of huge ability and the highest integrity and I know he has enormous respect for and knowledge of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, having worked with members of the organisation as close colleagues over the course of his career. I have complete confidence in him and the Government agreed with my recommendation to accept the nomination of the Authority in relation to his appointment.  </p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that dealing with the legacy of the troubles on this island is a complex and sensitive task, and one to which there are no easy solutions.</p><p>The Government, working with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland, agreed a framework of measures in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement to seek to address this legacy and we are fully committed to seeing those measures put in place and working in the interests of victims and their families.</p><p>The political impasse at the Northern Ireland Executive has delayed the roll out of these measures and the Government will continue to work hard to seek the re-establishment of the Executive for the benefit of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p><p>The Garda Authorities will continue to co-operate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of all relevant criminal investigations, whether contemporary or historical, in accordance with the arrangements in place.  There is also ongoing co-operation with Coroner&rsquo;s inquests in Northern Ireland and the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland in respect of historical investigations.</p><p>With regard to unresolved, troubles-related criminal investigations in this jurisdiction, the Garda Authorities will fully pursue any new evidence or information that comes to light with a view to bringing the perpetrators of crimes to justice.  There are also regular reviews of cases where it is considered that there may be grounds to advance those investigations.</p><p>As regards the Deputy's question in relation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality, that is a matter for the Committee. The Committee decides its own work programme and the individuals that it wishes to invite to appear before it and I have no function in the matter.</p></reply>

This Government and previous Governments are fully committed to this Convention and have fully participated in all that its ratification entails. The Optional Protocol to the Convention  (OPCAT) dates from 2007; it is in addition to the Convention and is designed to be preventive in nature. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to ratification and my Department is preparing The Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, with a view to enabling the ratification of OPCAT as soon as possible. In October 2017, officials in my Department attended and participated in a roundtable discussion at the launch of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's (IHREC) research into the implementation of OPCAT in Ireland. This research &ndash; comprising a comprehensive report prepared by the Human Rights Implementation Centre and accompanying submission by IHREC &ndash; outlined the Commission&rsquo;s position on what should be the primary considerations for the State in making progress towards ratification and implementation of OPCAT and set out recommendations in respect of the designation and coordination of a national preventative mechanism under OPCAT. </p>  <p>  IHREC&rsquo;s research was circulated by my Department to relevant stakeholders for their comments and observations. The stakeholders comprised those organisations with policy or operational responsibility in respect of inspection arrangements across the ambit of the national preventative mechanism regime provided for in OPCAT, which goes beyond the Justice sector. Additionally, stakeholders included advisory and advocacy organisations with expertise in this area.</p>  <p>  The last of these submissions was received in April 2018 and my officials are now in the process of considering them. This process will conclude this month, and a meeting has been arranged with the newly appointed Inspector of Prisons to discuss the future role of the Inspector's Office as part of the implementation. This engagement will inform the development of the draft Inspection of Places of Detention Bill to enable ratification of OPCAT. My intention is that the draft Scheme will be finalised in the Autumn so that I can bring it to Government before the end of the year.</p></reply>

The Authority attaches particular significance to steps being taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to embed the Code.  The Policing Plan for 2018, approved by the Policing Authority with my consent, sets out the Code of Ethics commitments and contains specific initiatives and performance measures in this regard, including initiatives in relation to the delivery of training. The Policing Authority has a dedicated Code of Ethics Committee which meets regularly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assess steps being taken and Policing Authority members and staff have attended many of the training sessions to assess first-hand the work being done.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Steering Committee in charge of the delivery of Workshops on the Code of Ethics to the organisation recognises that it is vital that each member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na signs the Declaration on the Code of Ethics to demonstrate their commitment to the nine standards and commitments.  A process is underway at present to understand exactly why members have not signed the Declaration and following this process, the Committee will undertake further critical interventions to ensure sign up by every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the end of September 2018.  Furthermore, at the most recent Public meeting of the Policing Authority, the Acting Commissioner called on all members to sign the Declaration on the Code of Ethics and reiterated his commitment and that of senior leadership to embedding the Code.</p>  <p>  I join with him in this call and will be monitoring developments in the coming months.</p></reply>

In pursuance of this commitment, a new Community-based CCTV grant-aid Scheme was launched by my Department in April 2017 to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas. It is intended that the Scheme will run for 3 years with funding of some &euro;1 million being made available each year.</p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000. Upon approval, the applicant will receive an up-front payment of 50% of the grant with the balance to be paid when the system is fully operational. </p>  <p>  There has been an increasing level of enquiries relating to the Scheme. A total of 13 applications have been received to date and I understand that a significant number of other applications are currently being finalised for early submission. </p>  <p>  4 applications under the Scheme have been approved to date, with approved funding totalling almost &euro;120,000. A further 6 applications are under active consideration (2 of which were received by my Department in the past week). The remaining 3 applications made to date have been returned to the applicants concerned, to enable them to provide the information necessary to qualify for grant-aid. </p>  <p>  Of the 4 approved applications for funding, 3 separate schemes are being established in County Wexford and 1 in County Wicklow. </p>  <p>  Full details of the grant aid package including guidelines, application forms, code of practice and other relevant documentation are all available to download from my Department's website www.justice.ie.  In addition, my officials are available to provide assistance and guidance to any interested party in relation to the scheme, with a dedicated email address available for that purpose - communitycctv@justice.ie.</p>  <p>  I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, take advantage of the availability of this grant-aid scheme and I encourage any interested groups to make contact with my Department with any queries.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner established the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau (GNRPB) to ensure a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies. I am pleased to say that I obtained sanction for an additional Assistant Commissioner to head up the GNRPB who is responsible for the oversight and strategic management of the policing of our roads network. In order to support this very important work and to facilitate the restructuring of the Garda Traffic Corps to Roads Policing Units in line with the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021, I have also recently secured sanction for a Chief Superintendent in the area of Roads Planning and Major Event Management and the creation of two specialist posts in the GNRPB at Superintendent rank one for Roads Policing and one for Major Event Management. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that following an internal examination of the role and function of the Divisional Garda Traffic Corps, they have been re-named Garda Road Policing Units, to reflect the role the Units will play in denying criminals the use of the roads network. In addition to the Roads Policing Units focusing on the lifesaver offences of speeding, seatbelts, mobile phones and driving under the influence, they will also focus on crime prevention and crime detection. Divisional Roads Policing units will work closely with other Divisional units to target known criminals and to disrupt their activities through strict enforcement of road traffic legislation.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that following the completion of regional competitions for assignment to roads policing duties an additional 87 Garda&iacute; have been assigned to Roads Policing Units nationwide, in the first quarter of this year. It is planned that a further 63 Garda&iacute; will be assigned to the units later this year to bring the total additional Garda&iacute; assigned to Roads Policing in 2018 to 150 to support better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement and crime prevention. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that the strength of Roads Policing Units on the 31 May 2018, stood at 680. In addition, there is one Chief Superintendent and two Superintendents attached to the DMR Roads Policing Units, a Superintendent and Traffic Inspector attached to each of the other five Regions. It is important to note, that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through specific enforcement operations.</p>  <p>  For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 supports the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.</p>  <p>  The provision of these additional resources to the Commissioner is a key component in this Government's approach to improving public safety throughout the country which will undoubtedly benefit policing in relation to transport services in Dublin and in other areas. In this regard I have no plans to engage with the Commissioner to progress a dedicated public transport unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Investment is instead being made in enhancing the resources available for policing generally. I believe this is the best use of scarce resources. </p>  <p>  A further consideration is the ongoing deliberations of the Commission on the Future of Policing. Its terms of reference include consideration of the structures and management arrangements required for the most effective delivery of policing to meet the challenges of modern policing. I look forward to receiving its report in September. </p></reply>

The prosecution of sexual offences must be conducted with sensitivity to the needs of the complainant, while still respecting the rights of the accused person. The review which I have announced will examine all aspects of the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences to ensure that there is a compassionate and fair system in place. </p>  <p>  Terms of reference for the review have been drawn up, and the formal review will shortly commence.  As part of the preparatory process, I have conducted a series of consultations with representatives from a wide range of organisations in the sector to listen to their views. This was a useful exercise which helped to identify where there may be areas for improvement within the existing laws governing sexual offences. It also brought  valuable insight into the experiences of victims of sexual offences in their interactions with the criminal justice system in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  This Government is firmly committed to strengthening the law around sexual offences. The enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 last year was a significant development of the law on sexual offences, putting in place a statutory definition for consent to a sexual act. The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 has also significantly enhanced protections for victims of crime, including victims of sexual offences. </p>  <p>  The Government has also recently approved the drafting of two further pieces of legislation: a Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill which will provide for sentencing for repeat sex offenders, and a Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill, which strengthens the arrangements for post-release supervision of sex offenders. </p></reply>

Some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018. This is an increase of approximately 2% over the allocation for 2017 and includes some &euro;98.5 million for Garda overtime. Some &euro;1.61 billion was allocated to the Garda Vote for 2017 which, in itself, was an increase of approximately &euro;60 million over the allocation for 2016 (&euro;1.55 billion as per the 2016 Revised Estimates Version) and included approximately &euro;88.5 million for Garda overtime. In November 2017, I secured a supplementary estimate of some &euro;42 million for Garda overtime bringing the spend for 2017 to over &euro;130 million. This compares to a spend in previous years of &euro;91 million in 2016, &euro;56 million in 2015 and some &euro;37.7 million in 2014.</p>  <p>  This Government continues to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with unprecedented levels of resources. For example, the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real and tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  I might add that there are a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children, but I would also point to the need for parents to ensure, to the best of their ability, that their children are raised to be respectful and law abiding.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the deployment of Garda resources at local level, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda authorities, in the first instance, however, I am assured that Garda management carefully monitors the incidence of such crime and that Garda resources are deployed in response to changing crime trends. This may include directing resources at areas designated as &ldquo;hot-spots&rdquo; for anti-social behaviour. Clearly Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  </p>  <p>  Some &euro;342 million, including &euro;217m in additional funding under the Capital Plan, to improving Garda ICT infrastructure 2016-2021. This allows Garda&iacute; to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime, including the gathering of vital crime statistics, and will facilitate progress on important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on Crime Investigation.</p>  <p>  Further, the Government's Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides for significant resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Some &euro;46million was allocated for investment in the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the fleet in the period 2013 to 2015. In total in the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that increasing resources, of itself, will not defeat the scourge of gang-related and associated crime that currently obtains. However, it is clear from the recent CSO crime statistics which indicate a reduction in homicide figures that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to make significant progress in tackling the insidious threat of organised crime, particularly in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner-City through Operation Hybrid, where a proactive approach is being taken to combat those who seek to carry out such shocking murders and prevent further loss of life. I welcome the huge efforts made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent further loss of life;  in particular the preventing of over 50 murders since Operation Hybrid commenced.</p></reply>

While Ireland participates in a resettlement programme led by the UNHCR, it is the UNHCR which assesses each case and makes a referral to a participating State.  The selection of resettlement applicants by Ireland requires a detailed consideration of case files received from UNHCR as well as personal interviews, orientation and security assessments. Ireland has received no such referral in relation to this family from UNHCR and it should be noted that Ireland does not have a resettlement programme in Turkey.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate the vulnerability of the family who are the subject of the cross-party Deputies' request, Ireland cannot resettle people in response to one-off requests of this nature as this would potentially disadvantage the refugees who have fulfilled objective criteria to qualify for the refugee programme.  Ireland must take care to respect the integrity of the UNHCR decision making process, which is based on objective criteria and standard operating procedures intended to ensure the transparent, consistent and  fair treatment of people in need.  Ireland must also operate within the parameters of our own resettlement programme which is both demanding and exacting.  As I have already said, Ireland does not have a resettlement programme in Turkey.  Other countries may have such a programme in place and may be in a position to consider a request from UNHCR favourably.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-05a.188.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070500076#WRC05500"><p>As I stated last week when the latest crime statistics were released by the CSO, the rise in the recorded incidents of sexual assault, and particularly incidents of rape, is something this Government continues to take very seriously. Those found to have committed such abhorrent crimes will face the full force of the criminal justice system.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy will appreciate that the investigation of sexual offences is conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance, the Government has also moved to strengthen the legislative provisions in place to deal with these crimes. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 was a significant development of the law on sexual offences, putting in place a statutory definition for consent to a sexual act. This definition is both clear and wide-ranging, to ensure that the law is succinct and clear in what constitutes rape in this jurisdiction. Furthermore, this Act identifies those most vulnerable to sexual exploitation and it targets those who would take advantage of that. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government recently approved the drafting of two further pieces of legislation: a Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill, which will provide for presumptive minimum sentences for repeat sexual offenders, and the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill, which proposes a number of amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 following a review of the management of offenders under that Act. The scheme also includes provisions for the electronic monitoring of sex offenders, and court powers to prohibit a sex offender from working with children. It is my hope that both pieces of legislation will be progressed through the Oireachtas as expediently as possible.  I am of course very open to improvement of these Bills by amendment as they go through the Houses on the basis of discussions with all sides.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to ensuring astrong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. A total budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018, an increase of 2% on 2017. Furthermore, we are substantially increasing the number of Garda&iacute;. Since the Garda College reopened in September 2014, approximately 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a further 400 members will attest by the end of the year as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reach an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 by 2021.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have set up a National Protective Services Bureau to oversee the investigation of a range of crimes including sexual offences. Divisional Protective Services Units have been established in three Garda divisions, with plans for a further four divisional units in 2018 and establishment of units in all remaining divisions in 2019. These units are staffed by dedicated officers, and will include the investigation of sexual offences in their remit. To date, training for these units has concentrated on domestic abuse. Training workshops have also been delivered to local SORAM (sex offender risk assessment and management) teams in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Finally, while I am disappointed with the increases in sexual offences reported by the CSO last week, an important note here is that these figures do not represent prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland. These numbers are of cases reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na only. Increased reporting by victims of sexual offences to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may also be interpreted as an increase in confidence of victims to report and therefore may be evidence of improved policy making in the area. I would continue to encourage anyone who has been a victim of sexual assault to come forward and report the incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Issues of international trade fall under the common commercial policy of the EU. Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the common commercial policy is an exclusive competence of the Union. I have heard the argument that a public policy exception could apply to this Bill. However, I am advised that this argument is not well founded, and that the Court of Justice of the European Union interprets such unilateral restrictions on trade imposed by Member States very narrowly. </p></reply>

In the context of professional fees, this generally means where:</p>  <p>  - the duties of his or her employment necessitate that the employee is a member of a professional body, or holds a practicing certificate or licence, and</p>  <p>  - the employee cannot exercise those duties without that membership or certificate.</p>  <p>  Where such fees are not reimbursed by the employer then the employee concerned can claim the appropriate tax relief.  As regards deciding what fees might be covered by such a definition, I am advised by Revenue that if an employee failing to hold a professional membership would prevent an employer from carrying on its trade, it is reasonable to conclude that the employee&rsquo;s qualification or membership fee was necessarily incurred, regardless of whether the barrier to trade was created by statute or commercial necessity.  Where the employer or employee considers that an expense was commercially necessary, the employer or employee must be able to demonstrate that the employee would be unable to carry out his or her duties if he or she did not hold such qualification. </p>  <p>  Further guidance, including a series of examples of where the relief applies, is available on  www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-18.pdf.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the information from tax returns and other sources available to it does not provide a basis for estimating the cost of extending this measure to include other professional subscriptions paid by employees.</p></reply>

The independent advice and appeals framework provided for under the Examination will therefore become increasingly relevant for affected customers, as they consider the offers made to them.  The framework was structured by the Central Bank in such a way as to ensure that affected customers have further recourse options, ranging from the independent appeals process to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and the courts, if they are dissatisfied with any aspect of the redress and compensation offers made by their lender.  In this way, customers know that they can utilize in full the State&rsquo;s consumer protection framework. </p>  <p>  The appeals process is managed and administered by an independent secretariat in each lender.  The independent secretariat has a role in auditing the output of the panels in terms of assessing whether they have followed the procedures set out within each lender&rsquo;s Terms of Reference.  This is an important role to ensure the process is functioning as intended.  However, the length of the appeals process can vary greatly depending on a number of factors such as the level and quality of information provided by customers to support their appeal and on the type of appeal being made.</p>  <p>  It is important to note appeals panels are to be independent and, as such, while the Central Bank has provided the framework for the appeals process, the Central Bank is not involved in the operation or decisions of the panels as to do so could undermine the outcomes.</p>  <p>  In regard to Bank of Ireland, I can confirm that I met formally with the CEO of Bank of Ireland in March during which a broad range of banking matters were discussed including the tracker mortgage examination.  I am also currently scheduled to meet with the CEOs of Bank of Ireland, AIB, permanent tsb, Ulster Bank and KBC on 17 July to discuss the establishment of an independent body on banking culture.</p></reply>

The legislation establishing HBFI, the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018, was published on 18 June 2018 and is now commencing its passage through the Oireachtas.  It is envisaged that the HBFI legislation will be enacted shortly after the summer recess, and HBFI will begin accepting applications for lending before the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  HBFI is not intended to distort or displace any funding currently in the market.  It is intended to provide a lending option to all developers delivering residential property in Ireland at market equivalent terms and therefore it is not considered that this initiative has any State Aid implications.  HBFI would not be a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development.</p>  <p>  As HBFI will be competing directly in the market, the Irish authorities have at an early stage informally contacted the services of the EU Commission in relation to this Bill to outline the proposal in detail and illustrate how the establishment of HBFI does not contravene EU State aid rules.  Considering that officials in the Department of Finance have been cognisant of State aid issues since the inception of the initiative, and that the HBFI Bill was drafted to pre-emptively avoid contravening such rules, minimum changes to the text of the Bill were introduced as a result of discussion with the Commission's services.  Any changes that were made were of a technical nature and have no impact upon the policy goals or implementation of HBFI.</p>  <p>  This consultation has now concluded with officials in the Commission having communicated that they have at this stage no further questions concerning the initiative.  It is important to note that this communication is not a formal decision and will not bar a State Aid complaint being made to the EU Commission by a third party in the future.</p>  <p>  It continues to be essential that the HBFI Bill maintains compliance with EU State Aid rules as it passes through the Oireachtas, as any deviation from this may result in the necessity to apply to the EU Commission for State Aid approval in accordance TFEU Article 108.  The effect of this would be to materially delay the establishment of HBFI as under Article 108 a Member State is obliged to await the outcome of the Commission's investigation before implementing any notified measures.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers the best value for money.  It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour particular candidates on grounds such as organisation size, locality, nationality etc., and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.   </p>  <p>  However, there is a recognition at EU Level of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement.  The revised EU Directives on Procurement, transposed into Irish law in May 2016, are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.  Measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups include:</p>  <p>  - financial capacity criterion is generally limited to twice contract value - there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract;</p>  <p>  - discretion to divide public contracts into lots, with the proviso that opting not to divide a contract into lots must be explained in the procurement documents or the report on the procurement process;</p>  <p>  - electronic methods of communication are mandated in parts of the tender process;</p>  <p>  - the introduction of the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD), a self-declaration form aimed at reducing red tape for suppliers;</p>  <p>  - provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; may assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale if they were to bid as sole tenderers;</p>  <p>  - explicit provision for pre-market discussion with suppliers and independent experts, subject to safeguards against distorting competition or violating transparency and non-discrimination principles;</p>  <p>  - reductions in the time limits for receipt of tenders by approximately 30% compared to the position under the 2006 Regulations;</p>  <p>  - Member States are required to report back to the Commission every 3 years on SME participation in public procurement.</p>  <p>  A number of these measures had been accelerated into policy in 2014 in advance of the transposition of the revised Directives by Circular 10/14 - Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement, issued by the OGP. </p>  <p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The OGP works with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.  My colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, who has responsibility for public procurement, chairs quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, so that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) can be heard by Government.  SMEs are also encouraged to register on the Government's eTenders portal so that they can be notified of upcoming tendering opportunities.</p>  <p>  The OGP proactively engages with the SME industry representative bodies as well as the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the engagement of SMEs in public procurement.  Evidence of the work and co-operation in the area can be seen in events such as "Go-2-Tender" workshops and "Meet the Buyer" events. </p>  <p>  A SME Communication Strategy sub-group, chaired by the OGP, was also established in 2017 as a joint venture with the industry representative bodies to further promote awareness of potential opportunities and supports available for SMEs in tendering for public contracts.  As part of this initiative a series of informative YouTube videos explaining specific public procurement topics, along with case studies of successful SMEs who have won government contracts were launched on the OGP website earlier this year.  A series of focused and targeted breakfast briefings have also been scheduled around the country in conjunction with InterTrade Ireland and the SME Advisory Group partners.</p>  <p>  The data analysed by the OGP and published last September (2015 Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis Report) indicates that 94% of the State's expenditure is with firms within the State and the majority of spend analysed is with SMEs. </p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to proactively engage with business and strive to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.</p></reply>

I negotiated, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011.  The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.  The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).  Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone.  The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussions among the parties to the agreement on remaining salary scale issues in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of new entrants&rsquo; pay.  That process commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that meeting.  Further talks were held on the 27th of April with all public service unions in relation to new entrant pay.  Engagement between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the trade unions has been ongoing and meetings are currently taking place as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue.</p></reply>

However, I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year.  In the last two budgets, I made provision for 6,000 extra teachers and 3,000 extra SNAs and over 3,000 new middle management posts.  These resources were allocated to improve the learning experience right across the sector, with a particular focus on children with special needs.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2018 marked the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion.  Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  Improvements have been made for the restoration of grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  </p></reply>

My Department has also organised advanced training in data protection for a number of its staff. It is the intention of my Department to extend this training to other staff as the need arises.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is currently assessing how best it can meet the training requirements of all of its staff in connection the GDPR, with a view to providing access to training for all staff of the Department in the near future.  I cannot provide the Deputy with the details in this regard as the training is currently subject to procurement.  However, I can advise that it is intended that this training will cover the essential material in the legislation and will be tailored to the Department&rsquo;s circumstances.  The training will be made available for all staff of the Department over the course of the next year. </p>  <p>  Officials at my Department have also been informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that they have issued a request for tenders in relation to the award of a contract for the provision of services to deliver training for Data Protection Officers within the civil service and bodies across the public sector.  The submitted tenders have been assessed and it is expected that the winning tenderer will be notified shortly. </p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that Aegis agencies, like all data controllers, are required to implement appropriate measures to demonstrate compliance with their obligations under the GDPR and related data protection legislation. These are operational matters for the bodies concerned.</p></reply>

The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) report, which included the survey of mathematics teachers' qualifications, the results of which were published last week by the Educational Research Centre, found that only six out of 39 countries obtained significantly higher mean scores than Ireland in mathematics, while seven countries significantly outperformed Ireland in science. </p>  <p>  While the findings are not directly comparable, the TIMSS report would suggest that the situation regarding out-of-field mathematics teachers taking classes in schools has improved, compared to 2010. A report in 2010 by the University of Limerick showed that in a study of 51 schools, 48% of teachers in the study did not have a major teaching qualification in mathematics.  On foot of that report, with funding from the Department, over 1000 out-of-field maths teachers will have gained a post-graduate qualification through the a programme led by EPI-STEM, the National Centre for STEM Education at University of Limerick, by 2020. </p>  <p>  The STEM Policy Statement and Implementation Plan, which I launched in November 2017, aims to make Ireland the best in Europe in STEM by 2026.  I recognise that there are still challenges and the achievement of our STEM goals will rely on the availability of suitably qualified teachers to meet our schools' needs. This is one of a range of issues being considered by the Teacher Supply Steering Group, that I recently established.  Already, as I announced earlier this year, following consultation with the Irish Universities Association, extra places on initial teacher education programmes have been provided by the universities in targeted subjects, including in STEM, from September 2018. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will note that, although the findings are likely to correlate strongly to the Teaching Council's requirements for teaching mathematics, the Educational Research Centre's report states that, due to the way in which the TIMSS question was asked, a direct comparison with the Teaching Council&rsquo;s requirement for teaching mathematics was not possible.</p></reply>

SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices in these areas. Despite this the number of female apprentices in the craft apprenticeships remains low.</p><p>Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system in Ireland into a range of new sectors of the economy, following two calls for new apprenticeship proposals from employers and education and training providers.  To date eleven apprenticeship programmes are operational and we are now seeing a strong increase in female participation in many of these new programmes, particularly in the financial and hospitality sectors.  With further new apprenticeships to get underway this year, many of which that are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace, it is expected, as these new apprenticeships are rolled out, that this will lead to a continued increase in female participation.  While this is welcome, it is also important to address issues influencing the low level of recruitment of women in the craft sectors.</p><p>As set out in our Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, my Department, in conjunction with SOLAS, is currently reviewing the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation. The review is due to be completed shortly.</p><p>Furthermore, a digital campaign to promote apprenticeship is now underway with a dedicated Twitter feed #Generation Apprenticeship, a new apprenticeship website , an Apprenticeship Ireland Facebook page and a LinkedIn page. In all aspects of the digital campaign women feature prominently and there will be a specific focus on encouraging women and girls to consider apprenticeship as a means of launching or developing their careers.</p></reply>

It will also examine the level of participation for those with disabilities.

There are a number of ongoing joint initiatives and policies which my Department leads across the criminal justice agencies aimed at preventing crime, increasing detection of crime, rehabilitation and supporting desistance from crime by persistent offenders. The first Joint Strategy on the Management of Offenders was developed in 2016 between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service and is being implemented on an ongoing basis.  </p>  <p>  Initiatives such as the successful Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC) which involves these four bodies are a strategic response to the management of prioritised prolific offenders. The evidence-based, intelligence-led objectives of J-ARC target the 25% of recidivists responsible for 75% of crime; manage identified prolific offenders in order to reduce crime, and enhance public safety by strengthening the co-ordination and integration of policy, practice and research. In 2017, the Irish Prison Service in conjunction with the Probation Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na extended J-ARC to three new locations in Dundalk, Waterford City and Limerick City.  </p>  <p>  A further development in this area is the Youth Joint Agency Response to Crime Initiative (YJ-ARC) launched in 2017. This targets young people aged 16 to 21 years who are the most prolific in their offending and provides a structured co-ordination between the Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Irish Prison Service, Irish Youth Justice Service (Oberstown campus), Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  This Government is fully committed to tackling all forms of criminality and this is evidenced by the increased allocations of resources provided by the Government in recent times. This includes a budget of &euro;1.6 billion in 2018 to support ongoing Garda operations, such as Operation Thor which involves special targeted patrols carried out with the assistance of Garda National Support Services against criminal groups who are committing crime inter-regionally. </p>  <p>  This Government will continue to support a high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. Indeed, I recently announced the launch of the 2018 recruitment campaign for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  In relation to legislation, in 2015 the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act was enacted which specifically targeted repeat offenders with provisions concerning bail and consecutive sentences. While sentencing within those limits is a matter for the judiciary, the Deputy may be aware of recent judgments of the Court of Appeal which set out principles to guide trial courts in imposing sentences for the offence of burglary. </p>  <p>  It is also the case that the Irish Prison Service has, in recent years, placed a much greater emphasis on rehabilitative and support services to prevent reoffending and support desistance from crime. The Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services. Access to these services is a critical feature for offenders in addressing their offending behaviour. Greater emphasis is now placed on pre-release planning, putting supports in place and making links to services in the community for offenders leaving custody.</p>  <p>  The year 2017 saw the continued successful implementation of the Joint Irish Prison Service &amp;amp; Probation Service Community Return Programme and the Community Support Scheme. These are structured temporary release schemes which provide for supervised community service and assist with reducing recidivism rates by providing additional supports for carefully selected prisoners.</p>  <p>  Overall I can reassure the Deputy that it is a priority of the Government and the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality to reduce crime, and specifically reoffending by those previously convicted.  </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the Cohort model of resource allocation has been in use by Garda management since 2015 and is currently the model utilised for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College. The model is a dynamic distribution model and aims to impose a numerical/mathematical measure on the policing needs of each Division nationwide. The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel, is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues. When allocation of resources is under review, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all relevant factors are taken into consideration. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p>  <p>  In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it has to be factored in that they have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. While not all Garda Stations are training stations it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p></reply>

That gave rise to a caseload of around 10,500 applications which had to be assessed very carefully to ensure that any fraudulent applications or potential abuses of the Directive are detected and dealt with appropriately.  Considerable progress is being made in processing these applications.  However, as legal proceedings in relation to a number of similar such applications are currently before the courts, the Deputy will appreciate that I am limited in what I can say on the matter.  </p><p>The central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-05a.367.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070500081#WRH01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 to 138, inclusive, together.</p><p>On 28 June last, Minister Stanton and I announced details of the coming into effect of the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive 2013 which includes enhanced access to the labour market for asylum seekers.  In summary, eligible applicants will have access to all sectors of employment, with a very small number of exceptions.  The Directive has much broader impacts on the wider protection system and includes important provisions in relation to health, education, children&rsquo;s rights, and material reception conditions including housing, food, clothing and a daily expense allowance.  The Directive came into operation on 30th June following my signing into law of the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018 Statutory Instrument giving effect to the various provisions of the Directive.  </p><p>Under the Regulations, asylum seekers will have access to the labour market nine months from the date when their protection application was lodged if they have not yet received a first instance recommendation from the International Protection Office and if they have cooperated with the process.  The permission, which will be issued on my behalf by the Labour Market Access Unit (LMAU) of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) covers both employment and self-employment and will be granted to eligible applicants for a six month period, renewable, until there is a final decision on their protection application.  The Deputy can be assured that the new labour market permissions will be issued with the same level of efficiency observable in relation to the self-employment permission issued by my officials during the interim period (i.e. a total of 770 applications were received and processed with 534 of those being granted between 9 February and 30 June 2018).  Persons issued with a self-employment permission who have not received a first instance decision within 9 months of their protection application being lodged will automatically receive a new labour market permission.  Persons that have already obtained a self-employment permission under the temporary scheme will be able to renew that permission, even if they have since received a first instance protection decision and are appealing that decision.  The Directive does not apply retrospectively for other applicants who have already had a negative first instance decision and have chosen to appeal that decision.</p><p>An information campaign commenced on 28th June to ensure that applicants, employers, trade unions, NGOs and all other relevant bodies are fully informed of the labour market access and eligibility arrangements that apply.  The campaign includes a nationwide tour of Accommodation Centres.  Full details and an application form are also available on the INIS website (<i></i>).</p><p>Supports given by the State to applicants and those under appeal include a range of services not available to other people in the country who are accessing the labour market.  We have a responsibility to treat all people equally.  As a result of this new reform a situation could arise where a protection applicant with free lodging, food, services including utilities, etc., would be in receipt of the same wage as a colleague who had to pay all their own expenses.  This would be inequitable. </p><p>State supports are given on the basis of need and means.  Now that we have given a broad and generous access to acquiring means, applicants and appellants will be treated on a par with others working in the State.  In relation to the requirement that residents in Accommodation Centres make a contribution towards the cost of their accommodation and related supports, this is a fair and proportionate measure.  It ensures that residents in State-provided accommodation, who have all services provided, are treated equitably with other workers in Ireland who have rent/mortgages and all of the other costs associated with financing one&rsquo;s own accommodation.  The rule of equity must also apply between protection applicants who are in the accommodation centres and those that are not living in the Centres.  </p><p>The practical arrangements in relation to collecting the contributions are currently being finalised, however, I would like to emphasise that no Protection Applicant will be required to make any financial contribution in respect of their direct provision accommodation and related supports until they have been in employment (or self-employment) for a period of 12 weeks.  When they are in a position to contribute, any such contributions will be on a sliding scale.  The maximum such contribution will not exceed the total cost to the State, and there will therefore be no situation in which the State will profit from such contributions.  Allowances are being made for situations where a partner is not working, while no parent will be charged for children regardless of their income.  Children will also maintain their full allowance in their own right. </p><p>Regarding a suggestion that additional supports should be put in place to assist those living in Accommodation Centres seeking a work permit from the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation, the necessity for seeking a work permit does not arise from 30 June.  Instead, those who are nine months without a first instance decision may apply to the Labour Market Access Unit of my Department for a labour market permission.  This is a very straightforward process and most applicants  and Accommodation Centre staff and NGOs are in a position to provide assistance, if required.  </p><p>It is important to note that the labour market permission is not restricted to applicants who are residing in Accommodation Centres.  Thus my Department is not focused on the number of applicants in each Centre who may be eligible to access the labour market but rather on the overall numbers who are eligible.  Accordingly, it is estimated that approximately 3,000 protection applicants will be eligible to apply for the permission.</p><p>Participation in the Reception Conditions Directive builds upon the existing programme of reforms to ensure that applicants are treated humanely and with dignity and respect while awaiting a final decision on their protection application. </p></reply>

The course, tailored to the needs of the Department, provided a comprehensive overview of the legislation as well as outlining the critical role staff have in protecting personal data.  Approximately 90% of staff have successfully completed the training to date.  A number of staff in the Data Protection Support and Compliance Office have also undertaken more specialist training in this area.  I have asked agencies under my Department's aegis who operate their own data protection policy arrangements to reply directly to the Deputy on the matter.</p>  <p>  I note also that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have issued a request for tenders in relation to the award of a contract for the provision of services to deliver customised training for Data Protection Officers within the civil service and bodies across the public sector.

As you are aware, there was no public interest investigation into this matter to which you referred as, after weighing the circumstances of the incident and considering the available information, the Ombudsman Commission decided that an investigation in the public interest was not warranted on this occasion.</p>  <p>  With regards to Question 149, relating to the number of staff attached to the Longford GSOC office by year, I have been informed that the Commission originally assigned 5 staff members to its Longford Office when it was established at the IDA Business Park, Ballinalee Road, Longford in February 2009.  In Early 2013, the number of staff was increased to 6 and this remains the number of staff currently assigned to GSOC's Longford Office.</p>  <p>  In relation to Question 150, I can advise the Deputy that the regional GSOC offices do not have a strictly defined responsibility for any particular geographic area.  GSOC teams are required to be flexible to meet case demands in whatever area of the country is necessary, depending on operational need and available resources.  However to ensure the most effective and efficient use of GSOC resources, where possible, cases are assigned to the regional office where the majority of the investigative work on a given case may be required. </p>  <p>  The manner in which cases are allocated is separate from the Commission's on-call service when responding to an incident that is the subject of a referral from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 102 of the Act.  In this instance, it is required that the investigation team rostered for on-call duty must respond to any referrals as they arise.  This may result in the on-call team handling an investigation at any location within the state, regardless of geographic proximity to where they are usually based.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a particular investigator or team may also be deployed to work away from their usual office location due to having a particular skill, training or area of expertise that would assist in a particular investigation.  In short, the three GSOC offices have responsibility for the entire country.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. I am informed, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that Rathcoole Garda Station forms part of the Clondalkin District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division. Rathcoole Garda Station is open daily from 10:00am to 1:00pm and 2:00pm to 6:00pm subject to available manpower. While the position is kept under review by the Garda authorities, I understand that there are currently no plans to increase the opening hours of the station.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the DMR West Division was 671. The strength of the Clondalkin District was 192, of whom 96 and 14 were assigned to Clondalkin and Rathcoole Garda Stations respectively. There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 55 civilians attached to the Division. Where appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. In that regard, I understand from the Garda authorities that supporting resources are available to personnel detailed for duty in Rathcoole, as is the case for all other subdistricts, from within the Division.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. </p></reply>

On an annual basis, approximately 13.5 million vehicle registrations are read by the Automated Number Plate Recognition System, 1.9 million records are exchanged electronically with the Court Services, 9.3 million PULSE searches are conducted, 19.5 million TETRA digital radio calls are made and 118,000 fingerprints are searched. The TETRA Radio system provides a modern digital encrypted radio system to all operational members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na allowing them to communicate securely.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that Garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24/7 basis. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016 - 2021 sets out a series of initiatives which will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime. In support of this plan, some &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. </p>  <p>  In this context, a broad range of ICT projects are being delivered to support existing systems and develop them further, with the overall goal of supporting the ongoing business requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in all fields, including the fight against organised crime activity.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Policing Plan sets out the organisation's priorities in tackling organised crime activity, together with its continued commitment to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including organised criminal activities.</p>  <p>  In tackling such activity, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. Multi-disciplinary approaches are also employed to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of the Proceeds of Crime legislation, money-laundering legislation, the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 relating to organised crime and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>  <p>  At the international level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises the available international mechanisms for police cooperation and training including CEPOL, Interpol, and Europol. Garda Liaison Officers are based on a full-time basis in other EU Member States, including the Netherlands, France, United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. Garda Liaison Officers are also based at Europol. </p>  <p>  Additionally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to participate in joint and multi-disciplinary and multi-jurisdictional investigations within the European Union and world-wide. Successful investigations, prosecutions and disruptions of criminal activities have been and continue to be achieved through these parallel investigations.</p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategies, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda Resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Furthermore, when allocations are taking place comprehensive consultation is carried out with local management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Kildare Division was 365.  There are also 18 Garda Reserves and 30 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 93 members have been allocated to the Kildare Division.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Kildare Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom-based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  While not all Garda Stations are training stations, it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in the following table the number of newly attested assigned to the Kildare Division as provided by the Commissioner.<table><tr><th colspan="7"><div>Probationer Garda Allocations Kildare Division 2015 to 2018</div></th></tr><tr><td>DIVISION</td><td>STATION </td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td><td>2017</td><td>2018</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>NAAS</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>24</td><td>6</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILDARE</td><td></td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWBRIDGE</td><td>5</td><td></td><td>8</td><td></td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LEIXLIP</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>14</td><td>19</td><td>47</td><td>13</td><td>93</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is an important piece of legislation, which strengthens the powers of the Courts and of the Garda&iacute; in dealing with persistent serious offenders.  The Act places a greater emphasis on the rights and the safety of victims and of the public in bail decisions, while continuing to safeguard the rights of the accused.  It provides increased guidance for the courts and greater transparency in the bail process.  The court has the power to refuse bail where there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is likely to commit a serious offence.  In assessing this likelihood, the court must take into account the nature and seriousness of the offence and the accused person&rsquo;s previous offending and may also take into account the danger he or she poses to the public if bail is granted.  The court is also required to give specific reasons for a bail decision including the granting of bail, the refusal of bail and the imposition of conditions of bail.</p>  <p>  These considerable changes to the bail system were only brought into force 10 months ago so their impact is not yet reflected in the annual crime statistics.  It is necessary to evaluate the impact of the Criminal Justice Act 2017 before determining whether further changes to the bail system are required.</p></reply>

There is also a constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p><p>The Criminal Justice Act 2017 (changed from the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016), which was enacted in June of this year, strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.</p><p>Under the Act, the Court will be required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  The Court will also have the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken.</p><p>Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act will provide for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthen Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail, increase the use of curfews, and allow for the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances where requested by Garda&iacute;.</p><p>I am advised by the Courts Service that figures can only be provided in respect of the number of bench warrants issued for persons who breached their bail and did not appear in Court.  The figures cannot indicate if the person was on bail for more than one offence or if they had more than one active bail bond at the same time.  The below table outlines the number of persons where bench warrants for breach of bail were issued between December 2017 and 30 June 2018.  When reviewing the information, it is worth noting the following:</p><p>- If a person received more than one warrant the person only appears once on the report.</p><p>- A Bench Warrant may cover more than one offence.</p><p>- The report displays the number of bench warrants issued.  Some may have been executed and some are still outstanding.<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>No. of Persons where bench warrants issued for breach of bail</th></tr><tr><td>Jan&ndash;Dec 2017</td><td>9,332</td></tr><tr><td>Jan&ndash;30 June 2018</td><td>6,085</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This equates to an occupancy rate of 94%.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that all committals to the prison service are dealt with in a manner which protects the safety of the prisoners themselves, the staff and the entire prisoner population.  Each prisoner is placed in accommodation deemed appropriate to the individual based on the information made available to the prison staff on committal, which would include health, the nature of the offence, criminal connections and possible conflicts with other prisoners.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that my officials are concentrating on aligning our prisoner population numbers with the Inspector of Prisons' recommendations in those prisons which are currently over capacity, namely Limerick Prison, the Dochas Centre and Cork Prison.  It must be acknowledged that the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts and they do not have the option of refusing to take prisoners into custody whether sentenced, on remand or awaiting trial.  Currently, there are particularly high numbers of prisoners on remand or awaiting trial in custody.  On 4 July 2018, 17% of the overall prisoner population were on remand or awaiting trial.  These prisoners must remain in custody until such time as they are either sentenced or released by the Courts Service.</p>  <p>  My officials in the Irish Prison Service continue to work closely with Governors and prison-based services in the prisons which are currently over capacity, towards identifying prisoners who may be suitable for transfer to another prison or for prisoners who may be suitable for structured early release, in order to reduce numbers and improve the living and working conditions for both prisoners and staff in these prisons.</p>  <p>  Works on the replacement of the B Division at Limerick Prison which will accommodate approximately 100 male prisoners and a new unit for 50 female prisoners on the site of Limerick Prison are expected to commence in late summer and will hopefully be completed within 33 months.  This project will greatly improve the living conditions for the male and female prisoners in Limerick Prison, and bring additional capacity to the system as a whole.</p></reply>

Any recommendation of organisational effect is disseminated within the Garda organisation to improve the overall investigative capability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the provision and allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team in the light of identified operational demands.

In November 2017, the Minister for Justice and Equality secured a supplementary estimate of some &euro;42 million for Garda overtime, bringing the spend for 2017 to over &euro;130 million.

The standard of accommodation provided to residents is regularly reviewed.  The Government has invested in improving the standard of accommodation provided to residents in a number of key ways.</p><p>The McMahon report was published in June of 2015.  This report forms the basis for ongoing improvements across the entirety of the system involving all Government Departments and Agencies.</p><p>The Department is implementing a large number of these commitments within two broad themes.  The first of these was by way of reforming legislation with the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016.</p><p>A key feature of this new legislation was the introduction of a new single application procedure which will significantly accelerate the protection determination process and by extension will reduce the length of time which applicants spend in State-provided accommodation.</p><p><b><i>Improvements to Accommodation</i></b></p><p>The second major theme of improvements is in the area of the delivery of services.</p><p>Following from the McMahon report and, in particular, since the publication of the Programme for a Partnership Government, a number of recommendations in relation to physical improvements to accommodation are being rolled out.  The following are some examples:</p><p>- The introduction of full independent living at the Mosney Accommodation centre - each family is now able to acquire fresh food to their liking so they may prepare meals themselves.  The new home cooking arrangements in Mosney went live on 23 January 2017.</p><p>- The full independent living model was subsequently rolled out in Ballyhaunis and Clonakilty in 2017 and in Athlone and Millstreet to date in 2018.  The independent living model is scheduled to commence in Bridgewater House in Carrick-On-Suir, Montague Hotel in Emo and the Birchwood Accommodation Centre in Waterford City by the end of Q3 2018.</p><p>- Communal cooking facilities are being rolled out to other centres including the State-owned centres (Killarney, Tralee, Knocklisheen in Limerick and Kinsale Road in Cork) and St Patrick&rsquo;s in Monaghan, Ocean View in Tramore and any other centres in which families are resident.</p><p>- A complete refurbishment consisting of triple glazed windows and doors and refurbished interiors in each accommodation unit at the Athlone Accommodation Centre.</p><p>- Improvements to a number of outdoor playgrounds and football pitches to provide for &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities.</p><p>- Teenagers' rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.</p><p>Recommendations of the McMahon report that involve structural changes or improvements continue be implemented as quickly as possible, with due consideration of possible fire safety, building regulation and planning issues.</p><p><b><i>Development of Standards for Accommodation Centres</i></b></p><p>A Working Group comprising of members of the NGO sector and officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and my Department has been developing a standards document which will see a high quality of accommodation services being available for persons in the protection process.  A public consultation process on these standards will commence shortly.</p><p><b><i>Remit of Ombudsmen</i></b></p><p>Another key recommendation of the McMahon report was that the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children should be extended to cover those who are living in State-provided accommodation.  This has now been implemented and the remit for both offices was extended with effect from Monday 3 April 2017.</p><p><b><i>Inspections of Accommodation Centres</i></b></p><p>All centres are scheduled for inspection at least 3 times a year, twice by staff from the RIA and once by an independent inspection service.  The inspections examine all rooms in the centre and assess the cleanliness and physical appearance of centres, the quality and variety of food options and health and safety issues and provide residents with the opportunity to report any issues directly to the inspector.  These inspection reports are published on the RIA website.</p><p>As can be seen from the foregoing, significant improvements have either been implemented or are being implemented across all aspects of the system of supports for those in the protection process.</p></reply>

Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that on 29 June 2018, the number of prisoners, including life sentence prisoners released into the community under the supervision of the Probation Service, was 298, which represented approximately 7% of the overall prison population.</p></reply>

Both operate to the highest standards and their staff are to be commended on their expertise and dedication to the application of science to crime investigation in Ireland over many years.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Technical Bureau provides assistance and technical support in the investigation of crime by conducting forensic examinations of crime scenes and the forensic examination of exhibits from such crime scenes and elsewhere.  The Technical Bureau is a modern forensic examination facility with state of the art examination equipment and appropriately trained and qualified expert personnel in the areas of fingerprint examination, ballistic and firearm examination, forensic photography, forensic document and handwriting examination and the mapping of crime scenes.  The Bureau received ISO 17025 accreditation in February 2016.</p>  <p>  FSI offers a broad range of forensic services that includes DNA analysis, drugs identification and quantification methods and physical and chemical analysis techniques.  FSI has received ISO 17025 accreditation and is a member of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutions (ENFSI).  Many of these techniques are also used by other members of the ENFSI and this network promotes sharing and adoption of best practices across institutes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that construction of a new FSI laboratory at the Backweston campus, Co. Kildare, will commence in the near future providing a modern, purpose-built facility, achieving best practice standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage.</p></reply>

It is imperative that Garda&iacute; are protected in carrying out their work and that the law reflects and responds to the situations in which they find themselves.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended) provides explicit statutory protection for peace officers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in relation to offences involving assault to or obstruction of a peace officer in the execution of his or her duty.  Section 19 of that Act provides that any person who assaults a peace officer acting in the execution of his or her duty is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years.  This maximum prison penalty was, in fact, increased from a 5 year term under the Criminal Justice Act of 2006.</p>  <p>  The general law relating to assault is contained in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Persons Act 1997, which deals comprehensively with a wide range of assault provisions, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties.  The assault and related provisions in that Act apply to assaults on all sectors of our community, which of course also includes members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division.</p></reply>

A significant number of refusals also arise as a result of employers failing to undertake the labour market needs test (LMNT) in line with legislative requirements. i.e. advertise the job vacancy in Ireland and EU in the first instance. For example, in 2016 some 67% of refusals related to a failure to adhere to the LMNT requirement.  Many of these applications would have been subsequently re-submitted and awarded.</p><p>A Frequently Asked Questions document, and a Checklist document for Chefs, which my officials have developed in order to assist employers and employees with the application process, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dbei.gov.ie.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-05a.472.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070500084#WRL01700"><p>On 26 June 2018, the European Council authorised the European Commission to open formal negotiations within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on how to divide up existing EU Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) between the EU27 Member States and the United Kingdom (UK). The European Commission leads on these matters as under the Treaties competence on trade issues is vested in the Commission under the Common Commercial Policy.</p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU has implications beyond the bilateral relationship between the EU and the UK, in particular with regard to their commitments under the Agreement establishing the WTO.  When the European Community accepted the WTO Agreement and the Multilateral Trade Agreements in 1994, the schedule of concessions and commitments that was Annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 for the European Communities was thereby simultaneously annexed for the UK.  As a consequence of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, the EU&rsquo;s existing quantitative commitments, notably the TRQs, will require adjustment. </p>  <p>  Given the timeframe under which the aforementioned negotiations will need to be conducted, it cannot be excluded that some may not be concluded within the necessary time limits before the UK is no longer covered under the EU&rsquo;s WTO Schedule. To this end, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation - COM (2018) 312 &ndash; on 22 May 2018 which seeks to ensure that in the absence of such agreement, the EU can nevertheless proceed with the apportionment of the TRQs by modifying the WTO tariff concessions and that the Commission is given the necessary powers to consequently amend the relevant EU provisions on the opening and implementation of the relevant TRQs.</p>  <p>  The products which have TRQs attached are primarily agricultural and fishery products (including specific beef, swine, sheep, poultry, dairy, fruit, vegetables, wheat, maize, rice and fish products), and a small number of industrial products (including specific wood, silicon, glass, flax and fructose products). The methodology applied to apportionment is based on the UK's share of total Union imports under the TRQ over a recent representative three-year period (2013-2015). This usage share is applied to the entire scheduled TRQ volume to arrive at the UK&rsquo;s share of a given TRQ. The Union&rsquo;s share then consists of the remainder of the TRQ in question. This means the total volume of a given TRQ is not changed. The full product list including the EU share in quota is contained in the Regulation Annex.</p>  <p>  Ireland appreciates the European Commission&rsquo;s need to act swiftly in this area, against the backdrop of the UK&rsquo;s planned withdrawal from the Union, and the urgency which was therefore attached to securing the necessary negotiating mandate from Council.   </p>  <p>  My Department has actively engaged with the discussions to date at EU level.  Ireland prioritises the need to minimise disruption to trade as the UK leaves the EU and the importance of maintaining the existing levels of market access, which is the intention of the European Commission.   Ireland was one of a number of Member States who sought to enhance the consultation requirements for the European Commission with Member States in the apportionment process and we were successful in that regard.  This provides us with assurances that any unintended consequences of the proposed approach, given the fluidity of the overall Brexit process, will be discussed by Member States at the relevant Committee, in particular, the Trade Policy Committee.  </p>  <p>  As appropriate, my Department will be liaising closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as the negotiations commence and progress.   </p>  <p>  Finally, one of the Government&rsquo;s central objectives for the Brexit negotiations is to minimise the impact on trade and the economy. Research commissioned by my Department demonstrates that a hard Brexit scenario would be most harmful for the Irish economy. This is a scenario we are working to avoid. In this context, it is one of our key negotiating principles to maintain as close a trading relationship with the United Kingdom as possible, post Brexit.  In this regard, it is welcome that both the British Government, in Prime Minister Theresa May&rsquo;s Mansion House Speech on 2 March 2018, and the EU, in its 23 March 2018 Guidelines on the framework for the future relationship, have signalled a desire to maintain zero tariffs and no quantitative restrictions insofar as bilateral EU/UK trade in goods is concerned.</p></reply>

The review is on schedule for completion with a full report due in the coming weeks.  Following on from that Report, it is expected that a review of the lists of occupations for employment permits will be conducted in the second half of this year.   </p>  <p>  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and wider EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.  The employment permits system is managed in part through the operation of the highly skilled and ineligible occupation lists for the purpose of grant of employment permits.  </p>  <p>  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs and, coordinated by the National Skills Council, the annual National Skills Bulletin and the annual Vacancy Overview Report in tandem with a public consultation process.  </p>  <p>  Care workers are currently included on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL).   In order to remove a skill from this list, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed evidence-based case for removal of care workers from the ineligible list, based on this detailed data would then need to be put forward by the Department of Health, as the lead Department for the sector, to my Department for review and consideration. </p>  <p>  I am aware that my colleague, Minister of State Daly, with special responsibility for Older People, has had various meetings with the nursing home sector and this matter has been discussed.  I understand Minister Daly is willing to work with the industry on this important issue to ensure continuity of service in the best interests of residents.</p></reply>

The openness of our economy and the high dependence on imported fossil fuels makes Ireland&rsquo;s energy prices vulnerable to substantial oil price fluctuations. </p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness remains a key economic priority for my Department and we continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis.  The Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Scorecard 2018 Report, which will be published shortly by the National Completeness Council, finds that average electricity and gas prices for business increased in the second half of 2017.  Higher energy costs increase firms' input costs, thereby reducing profitability, all else being equal. At the household level, higher energy prices result in higher consumer prices. </p>  <p>  There are limits to the extent to which policymakers or regulators can, or indeed should, intervene to influence prices in competitive markets. In terms of ensuring our cost competitiveness, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage the controllable portion of their respective cost bases, drive efficiency and continue to take action to address unnecessarily high costs. Such actions will ensure that improvements in relative cost competitiveness are more sustainable, leaving Ireland better positioned to cope with external shocks. </p></reply>

The WRC assumed the roles and functions previously carried out by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), the Equality Tribunal (ET), the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) and the first-instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT).</p><p>The WRC&rsquo;s core functions include the carrying out of inspections of employer records in relation to employment rights compliance, the provision of information, adjudicating on complaints under employment rights, equality and industrial relations legislation and the provision of mediation, conciliation and advisory services.</p><p>The inspection and enforcement services of the WRC endeavour to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records.  In instances where employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and/or pay money due to their employees these cases are referred for prosecution.</p><p>Table 1: The number of workplace relations inspectors employed at the end of 2015, 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018 is as follows:<table><tr><th>Number of Inspectors in WRC</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>To date in 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Administrative Officer Team   Managers</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>HEO Inspection Team Managers</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Executive Officer Inspectors:</td><td>48</td><td>48</td><td>51</td><td>54</td></tr></table></p><p>The WRC is staffed by civil servants who are part of the overall staffing of my Department. The details at table 2 set out the number of staff employed in the WRC at end of 2015, 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018. </p><p>Table 2: The number of staff employed by the WRC at the end of 2015, 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018 is as follows:<table><tr><th>Number of staff in the WRC</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>To date in 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Headcount</td><td>168</td><td>162</td><td>173</td><td>186</td></tr><tr><td>Full time equivalents</td><td>159.96</td><td>154.36</td><td>165.09</td><td>179.33</td></tr></table></p><p>The WRC carries out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislation. These inspections arise </p><p>- In response to  complaints received of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation; </p><p>- As part of targeted campaigns which focus on compliance in specific sectors or specific pieces of legislation, or </p><p>- As routine inspections, which act as a control measure.</p><p>Table 3: The number of workplace inspections by WRC inspectors in 2015, 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018 is as follows: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Inspections</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>5,185</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>4,830</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>4,750</td></tr><tr><td>2018 (to   30 June)</td><td>2,911</td></tr></table></p><p>As the WRC was established late in the 2015 fiscal year, the budgets of the individual workplace relations bodies,(which were amalgamated to form the WRC),  remained unchanged until the following year. The pay/non-pay budget allocations of the various workplace relations bodies  in 2015 were as follows: </p><p>Table 4: Pay and non-pay budget allocation for Workplace Relations Bodies 2015.<table><tr><th>2015 </th><th>Non- pay&euro;000 </th><th>Pay &euro;000</th><th>Total&euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>National Employment Rights Authority (NERA)</td><td>862</td><td>5,183</td><td>6,045</td></tr><tr><td>Labour Relations Commission (LRC)</td><td>814</td><td>4,130</td><td>4,944</td></tr><tr><td>Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT)</td><td>422</td><td>2,960</td><td>3,382</td></tr><tr><td>Equality Tribunal (ET)</td><td>239</td><td>1,460</td><td>1,699</td></tr></table></p><p>The budget allocation for the WRC is made up of pay and non-pay elements in support of the work activities of the Commission.  Officials of my Department work closely with the WRC during the annual estimates process to ensure that adequate funding is provided to enable the WRC to fulfil its mandate. Details of the WRC&rsquo;s funding in terms of pay and non-pay for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are set out at table 5. </p><p>Table 5: The WRC budget allocation for pay and non-pay in 2016, 2017 and 2018.<table><tr><th>Workplace   Relations Commission (WRC)</th><th>Non- pay&euro;000</th><th>Pay &euro;000</th><th>Total &euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2,489</td><td>10,081</td><td>12,570</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2,314</td><td>11,065</td><td>13,379</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>2,314</td><td>11,700</td><td>14,014</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Membership of leading International Research Organisations is an important mechanism for facilitating this engagement. For this reason, the Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 to initiate negotiations with CERN on Ireland's membership options. </p>  <p>  Discussions with CERN commenced in 2016 and senior officials from my department, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland visited CERN in Geneva in July 2016. The Director-General of CERN, Dr Fabiola Gianotti, visited Dublin in October 2016 and met with the former Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor T.D. The information gathered during these engagements has provided my officials with a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of membership of CERN. While these benefits are significant, the cost of membership is also significant. Therefore, the case for membership of CERN must be assessed in the context of other investment priorities.</p>  <p>  From the most recent correspondence with CERN, the annual contribution for an Associate Member State is subject to bilateral agreement and is a minimum of 10% of the theoretical (full) Member State contribution.  The formula used is based upon the State's Net National Income (NNI).  CERN estimate that the minimum  annual contribution for Ireland as an Associate Member State would be 1.5 Million Swiss Francs, or approx. &euro;1.3 million at current exchange rates.  Previous indications from CERN have suggested that full membership could amount to approximately &euro;15 million per annum.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the position in relation to CERN membership, and its cost under review, and maintains contact with officials in CERN in relation to Ireland's potential membership.</p></reply>

It addressed particular problems that were identified in the co-operative sector and helps to ensure this model thrives and grows to its potential to promote appreciation of the co-operative as a form of enterprise. </p><p>My Department supports co-operatives in the same way as we support other enterprises. The co-operative model is one of a number of legal options that are available to those considering establishing themselves in business and the different models have their own distinct characteristics. It is of course a matter for each individual operation to choose the model that best suits the nature of the business and the desired ethos of the entity.</p><p>My Department provides a full range of enterprise supports for new and existing businesses, primarily through its development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices. I would direct the Deputy to my Department's website: . This webpage provides links to a number of useful resources including the Supporting SMEs online tool which helps direct SMEs to relevant Government supports (the tool contains over 170 supports).</p></reply>

First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. This application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form. As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. The SBCI assess the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers. Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank have participated since the scheme&rsquo;s launch on 28 March, while Allied Irish Bank followed on 25 June.

This progress is reflected in the 5.3 percent unemployment rate recorded in May 2018, down from a peak of 16 percent in early 2012.</p>  <p>  As recognized in this year's Plan, maintaining the economy's growth potential as the labour market tightens and the economy approaches full employment depends on addressing potential labour shortages, in terms of the quantity and quality of specific skills requirements, particularly in key sectors for the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Through the Action Plan for Jobs my Department works with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills, as well as other departments and agencies, to address potential labour and skills shortages in the economy through increasing the number of people able to participate in employment; and by ensuring that existing and future skills needs are met.</p>  <p>  This year's iteration of the Action Plan for Jobs includes labour activation and supply measures aimed at removing barriers to participation in employment; facilitating access to work for those who wish to do so by ensuring they have the opportunity to address real or perceived skills deficiencies; and facilitating the inward migration of workers, typically skilled workers, including those who left during the recession. </p>  <p>  These include further implementation of the Pathways to Work strategy; focusing activation efforts on groups outside the labour force; facilitating female participation in employment, notably through development of the Affordable Childcare scheme; and ensuring the Employment Permits system remains aligned to labour market needs through the undertaking of a system wide review.</p>  <p>  This year's plan also reflects the significant reforms to the education and training system in recent years, introduced to identify and address skills requirements in various sectors and to work towards providing a system for responding to the existing and future skills needs of enterprise- these include the publication by the Department of Education and Skills of the National Skills Strategy and Action Plan for Education, 2016-2019, as well as the establishment of the Regional Skills Fora and broadly based National Skills Council, on which my Department is represented.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Action Plan builds on these initiatives, by committing to the roll out of the Skills for Growth skills audit tool for regional enterprises; support for up to 6,200 Apprenticeship and 3,900 traineeship registrations; development of 10 new Apprenticeship programmes, as well as Springboard+ course provision, in sectors with identified skills needs; publication and implementation of a successor to the ICT Skills Action Plan; and the undertaking of a study on skills for the digital economy. </p></reply>

Legal advice was sought and received to the effect the Directive imposes a requirement for a subjective public interest test and that the transposing legislation should amend the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 by adding a requirement that a "protected disclosure" coming within Article 5 (b) of the Directive i.e. a disclosure involving revealing misconduct, wrongdoing or illegal activity, must be made for the purpose of protecting the public interest.  Accordingly S.I. 188 of 2018 contains such an amendment so that Ireland achieves a full transposition of the Directive.</p></reply>

The scheme is provided for by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>Rental income whether arising in the State or otherwise must be included in the calculation of an applicant&rsquo;s income.  Under Part 3 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, income tax and levies required by law to be paid are included as an allowable deduction on income for the purposes of assessing the contribution to care. Expenses relating to rental income are not deducted when assessing an applicant&rsquo;s income contribution.  </p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 does not provide for deductions to be made from gross rental income for expenses relating to general maintenance. These expenses are not covered under the definition of &lsquo;allowable deduction&rsquo; as set out at Part 3 Section 1 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. </p><p>With regard to letting agents fees,<b></b>the expenses paid by the landlord to the agent are not deemed to be an allowable deduction on rental income for the purposes of the scheme.  The amount of rent received from the tenant is the amount that is considered for the purposes of the financial assessment under the scheme. The agent is acting on behalf of the landlord and if any amount of the rental income is used to pay for expenses/fees by the agent, it is done so on the instruction of and on behalf of the landlord/applicant under the scheme.</p><p>Where an applicant for the scheme is in receipt of income from rentals, documentary evidence in the form of either a Revenue End of Year Tax Statement or a copy of the rental agreement is requested by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Office.</p></reply>

However, ensuring the continued supply and availability of medicines to patients in Ireland post-Brexit is a key priority for the Department and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, as the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The HPRA&rsquo;s Brexit-related activities are focused on protecting the availability of medicines for Irish patients and the integrity of Ireland's medicines market.  The authority established an internal working group which has developed plans for all possible outcomes and scenarios that may arise when the UK leaves the European Union.  The HPRA continues to engage with the pharmaceutical companies who are the marketing authorisation holders of medicines in Ireland in order to quantify the scale of potential challenges and to offer the agency&rsquo;s support in maintaining products on the Irish market. </p>  <p>  The HPRA has also identified a number of risk mitigation measures, including maintaining joint labelling with the UK, where possible; expediting assessment of mutual recognition applications for critical medicines; authorising medicines via the new national authorisation procedure on the basis of public health need; identifying alternative EEA countries for parallel imports; and establishing increased collaboration and bilateral agreements with other MS.  This work is considered essential to help protect medicines supply in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is fully supportive of the HPRA's on-going work to prepare for Brexit, and to continue to deliver on its remit to protect and enhance public and animal health if the UK fully exits the current regulatory systems in March 2019. </p>  <p>  The Department and HPRA also contribute to on-going review and discussion of mitigating actions at national and EU level, and working to ensure that legislative interpretations of the &lsquo;pharmaceutical acquis&rsquo; consider fully the public health implications on European patients and that they are not be placed at a disadvantage through deprived access to medicines.  In April, at a bilateral meeting with the Commission Brexit Preparedness Group, Department officials identified these risks and made Ireland&rsquo;s public health concerns explicitly known. </p>  <p>  As a significant purchaser of medicines, the HSE is an important stakeholder in this matter.  The HSE is working on contingency plans in a number of areas in relation to Brexit, including measures required to maintain patient services and continuity of supplies.  This includes liaison with the Pharmaceutical Industry and distributors in relation to medicines, in order to identify risk areas regarding supply and to ensure that contingency arrangements are in place.  </p></reply>

As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines.  The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p><p>In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p><p>As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p><p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p>The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p><p>I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

The Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan 2018 outlines the combined impact of HSE and NTPF activity in 2018.  Under the Plan, the NTPF activity will target provision of 22,000 inpatient day case procedures in 2018.</p>  <p>  The NTPF advises that as at the end of June, across insourcing, outsourcing and scopes initiatives, almost 22,000 patients have been authorised for treatment.  Of these, over 11,100 have accepted offers of treatment and of these almost 9,000 patients have treated to date in 2018. </p></reply>

These protocols aim to ensure that all women eligible for the programme receive the highest quality mammography screening based on international evidence.</p>  <p>  BreastCheck has been accredited three times by international experts.  At its most recent inspection, the accreditation agency EUREF (European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services) awarded the programme reference status for the period until 2020, indicating that the policy and practices in place were an example to other national programmes to follow.</p>  <p>  Digital mammography was introduced by BreastCheck in 2007 following a successful pilot programme which demonstrated significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, particularly for women with denser breast tissue, when compared to analogue or screen-film mammography. </p>  <p>  The digital format has resulted in enhancement of image quality, particularly associated with improved visualisation of dense breast tissue.  Digital mammography also results in significant reductions in radiation dose associated with screening examinations, and allows images to be acquired and viewed in a shorter time.  At present, digital mammography platforms do not provide a quantifiable breast density measurement. </p>  <p>  BreastCheck has always emphasised that  a woman developing any symptom after a normal mammogram should contact their GP. </p></reply>

This State funded scheme facilitates development of the horticulture sector, by providing grant aid at a rate of 40% (50% in the case of young applicants under 35 years of age) on approved costs associated with capital investment in a broad range of specialised horticultural equipment and buildings.  I was able to increase funding for the Scheme from &euro;4.5 million to &euro;5 million in 2017 and again for 2018.</p>  <p>  Each year under this Scheme my Department provides grant aid to a number of horticultural growers that wish to invest in specialised crop irrigation equipment.</p>  <p>  I recognise that in addition to the weather, competitiveness and a lack of available labour are other significant issues affecting the horticulture sector at present.</p>  <p>  As part of a longer term effort to address these issues Minister of State, Andrew Doyle, TD has co-chaired a number of meetings of the Horticulture Industry Forum.  The Forum agreed its &ldquo;Vision&rdquo; document last autumn and work is underway to progress the necessary actions identified in that document.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the shortage of labour to work in horticulture and other sectors of the agrifood industry.  This resulted in Minister Humphreys recently effecting changes to the Employment Permit Regulations.  This will make it easier for certain businesses in the agri-food sector to source workers from outside the EEA.  The changes, which will operate on a pilot basis initially, include provision for 500 employment permits for the horticulture sector.</p>  <p>  In addition in recognition of the changed economy and labour market, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is currently undertaking a review of the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system.  </p>  <p>  The issue of a review of farm gate prices to reflect the farm business environment is an issue between each grower and his or her customers.  However I would like to point out that Minister Humphreys has primary responsibility for matters relating to product pricing and competition.</p></reply>

This is a result of a concerted joined-up effort between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The certificate is for meat and meat products and applies for beef, sheep and poultry meats.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to put a figure on how much Ireland will export to Qatar.  The role of my Department and the Government is to facilitate access to international markets, to allow trade to commence.  It is then up to the industry to avail of this opportunity.</p>  <p>  However, I am pleased that Ireland has gained access to a market with excellent opportunities.  Ireland has already established some trade links with Qatar; Irish agri-food exports to Qatar amounted to &euro;8.8 million in 2017 of which around 70% is accounted for by dairy exports.  Meat consumption in Qatar is estimated to be high compared to global averages, and lamb accounts for around one-third of meat consumption.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work towards new market access agreements worldwide, in line with the market diversification theme of Foodwise 2025 and as a response to some of the challenges posed by Brexit.</p></reply>

In addition, there is a fast charging station located in Monaghan Town.</p>  <p>  The National Policy Framework: Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017 to 2030 sets out the need for electric vehicle charging in Ireland.  Although the existing capacity of the public charging network is considered adequate, development of infrastructure to meet the growing demand is necessary.</p>  <p>  A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network.  The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focuses on electric vehicles, is nearing completion and I expect to bring forward proposals that will support the provision of effective and efficient publically accessible electric vehicle charging later this year.</p>  <p>  Funding for public charging in local communities is already available through the Better Energy Communities Scheme.  The scheme, which is administered by the SEAI, supports community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area. </p>  <p>  To support home charging, where the majority of electric vehicle charging takes place, I introduced the Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant this year.  This supports the cost of installing a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600 for buyers of both new and second-hand electric vehicles.</p></reply>

However, recent CSO figures show this trend as having been reversed with overall motor premiums for the year 2018 as being lower in comparison to those for the previous two years, with a fall of over 19% between July 2016 and May 2018.</p><p>As you may know, the pricing of insurance products is a commercial matter for insurance companies, based on an assessment of the risks that they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p><p>The Department of Finance Cost of Insurance Working Group Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  Based on recommendations from this report, the Advisory Committee on SPSVs met with Insurance Ireland on 22 May 2017 to discuss motor insurance costs relating to the taxi industry and a report on same was presented to me on 21 June.  I have forwarded that report to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael D'Arcy, TD who is the chair of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  The Advisory Committee on SPSVs and Insurance Ireland have agreed that there should be ongoing engagement between them and it is my hope that this cooperation and engagement will help to address the concerns of taxi drivers regarding motor insurance issues including the cost of same.</p><p>Insurance Ireland operates a free insurance information service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in obtaining insurance.

The programme provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in disadvantaged rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population.</p>  <p>  CL&Aacute;R was originally launched in October 2001 to provide targeted investment in disadvantaged rural areas.  The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996.  The Cooley Peninsula which was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease.  The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R areas, over the period 1926 to 1996, was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to carry out a full review of qualifying CL&Aacute;R areas later this year on the basis of the 2016 Census data.  The level of depopulation will continue to be a primary factor in the designation of any area as a CL&Aacute;R area.  This review will involve a detailed examination of all areas of the country, as well as stakeholder consultation. </p>  <p>  The findings of the review will inform future launches of the CL&Aacute;R programme in 2019 and beyond.</p></reply>

The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996.  The Cooley Peninsula which was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease.  The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R areas, over the period 1926 to 1996, was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002.  </p>  <p>  The analysis, which was carried out at a District Electoral Division (DED) level, found that the level of population decline in Wexford did not meet the qualifying criteria for inclusion in the programme.  As a result, no DED in Wexford was designated as a CL&Aacute;R DED.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to carry out a full review of qualifying CL&Aacute;R areas later this year on the basis of the 2016 Census data.  The level of depopulation will continue to be a primary factor in the designation of any area as a CL&Aacute;R area.  This review will involve a detailed examination of all areas of the country, as well as stakeholder consultation.  The findings of the review will inform future launches of the CL&Aacute;R programme in 2019 and beyond.</p></reply>

Louth by the Walkinstown Association for People with an Intellectual Disability (WALK Ltd).  The project provides for customised supports for its participants to access employment.  The target group is young people with disabilities aged 16 &ndash; 24.</p>  <p>  The project was originally one of 14 disability activation projects that were jointly funded by the European Social Fund (ESF) and the exchequer between 2012 and April 2015.  After the ending of ESF funding, as provided for in EU regulations, the WALK PEER project obtained additional funding from both a private sector organisation and the HSE.</p>  <p>  Research work by the National Disability Authority and others demonstrated that there is a need for supports to be put in place for young people with disabilities during the transition period from education and other services into the world of work.  Arising from these findings, the Ability programme was developed.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Ability&rsquo; programme is a new pre-activation programme for young people with disabilities.  The projects to be funded under this programme will provide supports and assistance for young people with disabilities aged between15 to 29 years old during this &lsquo;transition&rsquo; period.  The programme is being co-funded by the Exchequer and the EU (under the European Social Fund, as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020).</p>  <p>  Following representations from WALK Ltd it was decided to provide funding on an interim basis from the Department for the project, pending the introduction of the Ability programme.  This for example saw funding being put in place to a maximum of some &euro;75k in 2018 over two three month periods, while the Ability programme was being put in place.</p>  <p>  Pobal have been contracted by DEASP to manage the Ability programme including the application and evaluation process for the proposals received: the Ability programme attracted 59 applications.  A detailed and independent assessment process was undertaken by Pobal of the applications.  Pobal awarded scores for all applications based on a weighted marking system, as below:</p>  <p>  - Meeting the programme/ measure priorities (40%)Need for the proposal (20%)</p>  <p>  - Capacity of the organisation (20%)</p>  <p>  - Value for money (20%)</p>  <p>  Only projects receiving a score of 60 or above were deemed by Pobal to be of sufficiently high standard to be recommended for funding.  On this basis, Pobal recommended 27 projects as being suitable for funding; this represents some 46% of the proposals received.</p>  <p>  On the 1st of June this year, the outcomes of the above process were announced.  Two applications under the &lsquo;WALK&rsquo; umbrella for funding were successful.  These were: WALK Ltd and Walkinstown Green Social Enterprise Limited, the latter company is wholly owned by the former.  These projects will receive combined funding of more than &euro;1,070,000 over the course of the Ability programme.</p>  <p>  If the WALK Ltd funding was to be replicated to an additional 25 counties this would, based on a simplistic calculation, require additional funding in excess of &euro;5m per year, this does not include set up costs or factor in a county by county analysis (an analysis for example of existing service provision by county, demand factors etc.).</p>  <p>  At the time of the launch of the &lsquo;Ability&rsquo; measure, it was expected that funding for the Ability programme would amount to some &euro;10 million over a three year period.  However, given the number and quality of the proposals received, enhanced funding arrangements have been put in place of &euro;16 million to support all 27 projects recommended for funding by Pobal.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that while some of the successful applications came from organisations that are headquartered or based in particular locations, some of the projects will be providing services beyond that county in which they are based, and in some cases providing services across the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Ability programme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection continues through its nationwide network of Intreo offices and through the EmployAbility service (a specialist service that has been designed to support people with disabilities &ndash; which is delivered on behalf of the department by 23 companies located around the country) to offer a full range of supports and services to people with disabilities who wish to pursue their employment ambitions.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the deputy.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.</p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature.  This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.  The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  In finalising the report some further consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements.  These matters are now almost completed and I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

Local authorities were engaging with the property owners in relation to 573 properties, 31 agreements for lease had been signed and 9 homes had been delivered and tenanted.  A detailed breakdown of the RLS scheme data up to end Q4 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>I am making &euro;32 million available for the scheme in 2018 and I expect local authorities and AHBs to continue to implement the scheme locally.  Expenditure for 2017 is set out in the following table.</p><p><b>2017 Year End RLS Expenditure</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>&euro; - Current</th><th>&euro; - Capital</th></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council</td><td>&euro;8,809</td><td>&euro;4,987</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council</td><td>&euro;17,371</td><td>&euro;191,398</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td>&euro;4,009</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;30,189</td><td>&euro;196,385</td></tr></table></p><p>Over the period 2016 to 2021, the national target is for the delivery of an additional 50,000 social housing homes through Build, Acquisition and Leasing Schemes.  The ambition is for 33,500 of these homes to be delivered through new build programmes including Part V; for 6,500 to be delivered through Acquisition programmes including the Housing Agency Acquisition Programme; and for the remaining 10,000 homes to be delivered under a range of leasing initiatives including the RLS.  Out of the total 10,000 homes to be delivered under Leasing, it is expected that 2,000 will be leased by local authorities in 2018 under a range of initiatives, including the Repair and Leasing Scheme, long term leasing and the new Enhanced Lease.</p><p>I wrote to all Local Authorities on 18 April 2018 setting out their social housing delivery targets for build, acquisition and leasing for 2018, and for the period 2018-2021.  The targets are published at the following link: .</p><p>The RLS data for end Q1 2018 are currently being collated and will be published shortly.</p></reply>

One of the projects being funded, which is being undertaken by the Irish Council for Social Housing, is the development of a Special Purpose Vehicle to facilitate investment into the AHB sector by private investors, including the Credit Union movement.  The project was approved in May last year and is being undertaken by the ICSH in 3 phases.  The first two phases have been completed and the third phase is due to be completed by the end of September 2018.</p>  <p>  In respect of the development of specific SPVs by the credit unions to enable them to make investments in the sector, it is a matter for the credit unions themselves to make the necessary arrangements.</p></reply>
