I, like a number of European ministers, was invited to attend given my position as Minister for Finance.  For further information, I would point the deputy to the Bilderberg Meetings website () which includes information on the organisation's governance, steering committee, meetings, attendees, agendas and associated press releases.  At this meeting and its workshops I took the opportunity to set out to my fellow attendees the opportunities that exist in Ireland for investors and multinational companies. </p><p>The Government is focused on encouraging and supporting foreign direct investment into Ireland to provide jobs and continue to support economic growth.  In January of this year, the IDA announced the highest level of employment in its client companies in its 67 year history.  IDA client companies created 18,983 new jobs in 2015.  These results mean that more than one-in-five private sector jobs in the economy are as a result of government supported FDI.  I would point out to the Deputy that a number of the business attendees represented companies which have very significant investments in Ireland that support thousands of Irish jobs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-23a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062300064#WRA00800"><p>The introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks (SSDs) is part of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The tax will contribute towards important public health goals, as well providing a new source of revenue for public spending and contribute towards funding the reduction in personal taxes.</p>  <p>  My officials, together with officials from the Department of Health and the Revenue Commissioners are considering the design and application of the tax on SSDs in order to achieve the goals set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.   This consideration will also include the implementation issues which would arise in introducing an SSD tax in Ireland.  As the Deputy may be aware, unlike alcohol and tobacco, SSDs are not a controlled product under the EU general excises directive, and therefore cannot be stored in tax warehouses for release and tracking so that raises issues in itself.  Therefore, it will be crucial that effective compliance measures are incorporated in the design of the tax to support collection in a Single Market environment in which the free movement of products cannot be impeded and products cannot be made subject to cross-border or excise movement controls. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the UK announced the introduction of a soft drinks industry levy in March 2016, with an extensive period of industry and stakeholder consultation, before the levy is actually imposed from April 2018.   Given the border that is shared between Ireland the UK, and the supermarket chains which operate and supply SSDs in both jurisdictions, it is important that we examine carefully how the UK tax will operate, and consider the effects that the design and timing of the introduction of the UK tax may have on an Irish tax on SSDs.</p>  <p>  At this point I have confidence that a tax on SSDs can be introduced from 2017.  However, I will want to carefully consider all aspects of the design and the implementation plan before making my decision.  If I find that the compliance and trade distortion risks that could arise, by applying such a tax in Ireland without a similar measure in the UK, are too high, I may decide to wait until the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy is in place before I introduce the tax.  Whether the tax is introduced in 2017 or not will ultimately be a matter for Budget 2017.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-23a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062300064#WRA01000"><p>In the first instance, I wish to confirm for the Deputy that the Government policy on remuneration at the banks which has been in place since mid-2011 is fully enforced.  The central plank of this policy, which is the pay cap of &euro;500,000, was subject to pre-existing contractual rights.  The current remuneration of Bank of Ireland's CEO, which has not been increased since that date, reflects this. </p>  <p>  In relation to voting at the recent Annual General Court of Bank of Ireland, the Deputy will be aware of the strong set of financial results posted by the bank for 2015 which built on the progress made in 2014 when the bank returned to profitability.  This progress directly benefits the State given its financial interest in Bank of Ireland and indeed some of its peers. </p>  <p>  Against this positive backdrop, to take the significant and unusual step of voting against any of the proposed resolutions could have been perceived as an attempt by the State to interfere in a commercial entity, in which the State is a 14% minority shareholder.  This could have done damage to Ireland in the eyes of the international investment community.  Accordingly I deemed it appropriate to direct the ISIF to vote in favour of all resolutions, including the resolution relating to Directors' remuneration.  I would also note that ISS Proxy Advisory Services - an expert independent firm which advises institutional shareholders on General Meeting voting matters - produced a recommendation that shareholders vote in favour of each of the resolutions.  Overall, the vote in favour of this particular resolution represented more than 99% of all eligible votes. </p></reply>

NAMA's results highlight the continued achievements of NAMA and the positive impact NAMA is having on Ireland's sustained recovery in carrying out its mandate both in terms of debt redemption, the delivery of the Dublin Docklands SDZ and the commercial funding of residential housing delivery.</p>  <p>  NAMA's continued strong performance since inception means that Board now expects to achieve a surplus of up to &euro;2.3bn over its life, subject to market conditions, which will be returned to State.</p>  <p>  I commend NAMA on its work to date and I have full confidence in NAMA's Board. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's reference to recent developments - I reiterate that, despite all the confusion and conflation in the coverage of this matter, it remains the case that allegations of wrongdoing have not been directed at NAMA.  All known allegations of wrongdoing are currently being investigated by the appropriate authorities.  We support these investigations and stand ready to assist in any way that is helpful and should remain careful not to compromise these investigations in any way.</p>  <p>  The most notable investigation is being carried out by the UK National Crime Agency a criminal investigation by the appropriate authorities in the appropriate jurisdiction.  Importantly, NAMA advises me that the NCA has confirmed that no aspect of the Agency's activities are under investigation.</p>  <p>  NAMA also has appeared twice before the Public Accounts Committee to discuss Project Eagle.  Based on recent comments of the PAC Chairman, I understand NAMA may soon appear for a third time to discuss these issues.  In that context the C&amp;AG is conducting a value for money review of Project Eagle which will be published and discussed in due course.  A report such as this should not be rushed and should allow the C&amp;AG the time required to conduct a fair and balanced examination of the issues in forming his opinions.  </p>  <p>  If appropriate lines of inquiry do arise which could usefully be pursued they will be brought forward for consideration.  However, I do not believe that it is appropriate to launch an investigation based purely on speculation. </p></reply>

While the Central Bank wants to have the Examination completed as soon as possible, it also recognises that this is a significant undertaking for lenders and it is important that they are given the necessary time to complete it.  As such, I have been informed that it will be some time before the final number of impacted customers is known.  Nonetheless, I understand that the Central Bank expects significant progress to be made by all lenders before the end of 2016 and has affirmed that the examination will remain a priority for as long as it takes to address all issues and deliver the right outcomes for customers.  In addition, the Central Bank has confirmed that during the Examination all lenders are to establish a dedicated unit to deal with any queries, complaints, and/or concerns that customers may have during the course of the Examination.  Nonetheless, I have been informed by the Central Bank that if a customer has a tracker related query they should continue to contact their lender through the regular contact channels.  As the Deputy will know, the Central Bank will be providing public updates on their website throughout the Examination.  I understand that the next update is due to be issued at the end of July.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-23a.22.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062300064#WRA01500"><p><i>17.</i> To ask the Minister for Finance to make a special short-term provision, to allow grass and silage harvesting activities by farm contractors to be zero rated for a period of two years to allow the sector get the benefit of a 13.5% addition to cashflow on farms, and to support the opportunities that this will provide for reinvestment in additional higher genetic worth dairy and beef animals; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[17491/16]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-23a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062300064#WRA01600"><p>The VAT treatment of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law (primarily Council Directive 2006/112/EC) with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Article 110 of the EU VAT Directive permits Member States to retain historical zero-rated VAT treatment where a good or service was zero rated on and from 1 January 1991, but no new zero rates can be introduced.  As a result, Ireland currently applies the zero rate to a range of goods and services including most foods, children's clothes and shoes, and oral medicines.  As agricultural services such as grass and silage harvesting were not charged at the zero rate on 1 January 1991, it is not possible under EU VAT law for Ireland to apply a zero rate to these activities, even on a short-term basis as the Deputy proposes.  However, I would point out that the 'combined supply and sowing/planting of seeds/plants etc. for the production of food, including animal feed' is zero-rated for VAT which in turn helps to achieve the aim of higher genetic worth dairy and beef animals as mentioned by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I would point out that farmers who are registered for VAT can recover their VAT costs, including the VAT on services provided by agricultural contractors.  Unregistered farmers are compensated by payment of the flat rate addition, currently 5.2%, in addition to the consideration they receive for their supplies of agricultural produce.  </p>  <p>  Agricultural contractors are obliged to be VAT-registered if they provide contracting services in excess of &euro;37,500 in a year.  VAT-registered traders are obliged to issue VAT invoices in relation to their supplies and to submit VAT returns.  Flat-rate farmers are not required to register for VAT unless they are engaged in other activities (e.g. farm contracting services) and the turnover from that other activity exceeds the VAT registration threshold; &euro;37,500 for supply of services and &euro;75,000 for supply of goods.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-23a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062300064#WRA01800"><p>Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the lifeblood of the Irish Economy.  They make up the vast majority of businesses in Ireland and account for approximately seven in every ten jobs.  Supporting the finance needs of these businesses is therefore a priority for this Government. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was incorporated in September 2014 and its goal is to ensure access to flexible and lower cost funding for Irish SMEs.  The SBCI launched its first product programme in February 2015 and lending to SMEs commenced in early March 2015 through its initial on-lending partners, AIB and Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Up to the end of December 2015, in its first nine months of operation, the SBCI lent some &euro;172 million to approximately 4600 SMEs.  The loans have been taken up by Irish SMEs for a variety of purposes and across a range of sectors in the economy.  84% of loans were for investment purposes and the average loan size is approximately &euro;37,000.  There is a wide geographical spread and the vast majority of loans are to regionally based SMEs outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  To further meet the financing needs of SMEs, the SBCI has expanded the number of on-lending partners through which its funds can be accessed.  The SBCI now has a total of six on-lending partners.  These are AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Merrion Fleet, Finance Ireland and First Citizen.</p>  <p>  The increased number of on-lenders is a key step in creating greater competition for SME lending in the Irish market, by supporting smaller indigenous providers of finance and providing funding for a broader range of products, including Asset Finance, Leasing and Contract Hire.  The SBCI is in advanced discussions with a number of other potential on-lenders.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that of the SBCI's initial funding capacity of &euro;800 million, &euro;791 million has now been committed to its on-lending partners to support the financing needs of SMEs.  The SBCI is currently in the process of securing additional funding from domestic and international sources to enable it to increase the amount of funds it can make available to SMEs.</p>  <p>  The SBCI is committed to leveraging existing and new relationships with on-lending partners to support SME growth and investment.  The SBCI has made significant progress to date, both in terms of providing funding to SMEs, and in building a strong infrastructure to provide long term support to SMEs.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be interested to note that the SBCI publishes information on its lending volumes to SMEs on a bi-annual basis.  The figures to end June 2016 will be published in July 2016 and it is expected that the lending volumes will have increased significantly.</p></reply>

It is precisely through the establishment of NAMA's commercial mandate that the purposes of the Act, including "to contribute to the social and economic development of the State", are achieved.</p>  <p>  The European Commission approved the establishment of NAMA and its mandate under EU state aid rules.  Any changes to the NAMA Act would require approval from the European Commission as being consistent with their approval of the establishment of NAMA and its original mandate.</p>  <p>  Such a change would prevent NAMA from achieving the best financial return for the State and could lead to an exchequer payment under the Government Guarantee of NAMA's senior debt.  It is also likely that such a change would result in NAMA being considered "within government" resulting in NAMA's debt coming onto the State's balance sheet.  This would mean that all NAMA debt and expenditure would be included as Government debt and expenditure which would seriously limit NAMA's ability to fund both its housing and SDZ commitments that it has already entered into.</p>  <p>  Remember that NAMA acquired loans, not land and not properties.  What are commonly dubbed "NAMA assets" or "NAMA properties" are in fact assets and properties owned by NAMA debtors which have been pledged as security for debts owed to NAMA.  Any action taken which reduced the proceeds from the sale of an asset securing a NAMA debt would reduce the amount a debtor is able to repay to NAMA, would deviate from NAMA's mandate, would likely breach debtor property rights and would not withstand legal challenge.</p>  <p>  Where the provision of social or affordable housing is consistent with NAMA's commercial mandate, NAMA has made a substantial contribution in the social housing sector.  Through its debtors and receivers, NAMA has established NARPs as an innovative model which has significantly reduced the up-front capital costs for local authorities in the delivery of over 2,000 residential units for social housing.  I understand NAMA is reviewing its remaining portfolio for any further units which may be offered under this initiative.</p>  <p>  I would also point out NAMA's ambition to fund, on a value maximising basis, the delivery of 20,000 homes by end 2020.  This initiative is entirely consistent with NAMA's mandate.  The Agency is playing an important role in funding commercially viable residential construction - including a significant proportion of starter homes - in areas of acute demand.</p>  <p>  In adhering to its existing mandate, NAMA already contributes to the social and economic development of the State and I do not propose to amend that mandate.</p></reply>

These are published in Table 2 on page 15 of the Summer Economic Statement and are consistent with compliance to our obligations under the expenditure benchmark which calculates fiscal space in line with the potential growth rate of GDP less a convergence margin as Ireland is not yet at its medium term budgetary objective of a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP.  It should be noted that revenue is not relevant to the calculation of fiscal space unless it arises from a discretionary policy decision.  Additional revenue arising from discretionary measures increases the overall fiscal space while the converse in relation to revenue reductions also applies.  </p>  <p>  The fiscal space projections in the Summer Economic Statement are not final and are likely to change between now and Budget 2017 as they are based on a number of moving parts.  These include GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins set each year by the European Commission and general government expenditure values produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for the National Income and Expenditure (NIE) and Government Finance Statistics (GFS). </p>  <p>  For 2017 the reference rates and convergence margins were set by the European Commission in their Spring forecast in May and will not change.  However the GDP deflator used is an average of the Commission's Spring and Autumn deflators.  As the Autumn deflator will not be finalised until after Budget 2017, a forecast will be produced by my Department to use in Budget projections.  Similarly a final outturn for government expenditure in 2016 will not be available.  However any changes to the profile of Exchequer spending in the meantime or revisions to the 2015 outturn in the CSO's Autumn EDP return will result in an update to my Department's forecast of the 2016 expenditure base.</p>  <p>  For 2018 none of the inputs required will be known for Budget 2017.  However any changes to 2016 and 2017 variables will result in revisions to the variables forecast by my Department for use in 2018 fiscal space calculations.</p></reply>

Since October 2015, investigations in three other Member States have concluded.  In each of these cases the Commission found that the Member States concerned granted an illegal State Aid to the companies in question.</p>  <p>  While the Commission has opened a formal investigation in relation to one particular case involving Ireland, it has not made a final determination in the matter.  While there is no formal timeline for when the final decision will be made in our case, I am aware of speculation about a possible decision in July.</p>  <p>  This is a priority matter and Ireland has co-operated fully with the process to date and will continue to do so.  My Department has engaged closely with the Commission throughout this process.  Detailed and comprehensive responses have been provided to the Commission demonstrating that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged in accordance with the relevant legislation, that no selective advantage was given and that there was no State Aid.  </p>  <p>  As part of this process, which involves a significant degree of legal and technical complexity, some &euro;667,000 has been spent to date by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners on legal and other services.  This figure does not incorporate any further legal costs or costs for other services pertaining to the Attorney General's Office.</p>  <p>  I remain of the view that there was no breach of State Aid rules in this case and that the legislative provisions were correctly applied.  In the event that the Commission forms the view that there was state aid, Ireland is entitled to challenge this decision in the European Courts.  As the Government has already indicated, we will take that course of action, if necessary, to continue to vigorously defend the Irish position.</p></reply>

Progress has been made on a number of the Programme for a Partnership Government commitments including the following:</p>  <p>  - The Implementation Group of the Personal Microcredit Scheme is committed to achieving the rollout and extension of the scheme and progress has already been made towards extending the geographical remit of the scheme and broadening the target audience beyond social welfare customers who have access to the Household Budgeting facility.</p>  <p>  - In relation to assisting credit unions in making successful applications to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000, the Central Bank has consulted with my Department on the application process and my officials have met with the Registrar to discuss the details of the application process.  Separately, the Registrar met with the representative bodies to obtain their feedback.  Final application forms are now available on the Central Bank's website.

These are valuable assets to the State and it is this Government's intention that the State would exit these investments in a measured and careful manner.  As I have indicated on a number of occasions, my primary objective in the disposal of these assets will be recovering the maximum amount of money for the Irish taxpayer.</p>  <p>  With regard to AIB in particular, I have indicated in the past that an IPO is likely to be the optimal route to recouping value from our investment.  At the beginning of this year officials in my Department appointed an Independent Financial Adviser, following a tender process, to assist with analysis and planning related to our shareholding in AIB, and much of this initial preparation has now been completed.  However, given the complex nature of an IPO process, the need to access certain IPO 'windows' and the recent volatility seen in stock markets, I would now deem it more likely that a market event involving AIB would occur in 2017, rather than 2016.  Clearly in order for us to proceed with an IPO, we would need to be satisfied that the market is prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the business bearing in mind its current performance and future prospects.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question on any retail element to an IPO, this option will be assessed along with many other considerations when deciding on how an IPO would be structured.  No decision has been made in this regard.</p>  <p>  BOI had a strong return to profitability in 2014 and built on this further in 2015.  The bank has made significant progress in reducing NPLs and growing new business.  Officials in my Department monitor market conditions and the performance of banking equities on an ongoing basis.  When I deem conditions conducive to recovering value for the Irish taxpayer, I will direct the ISIF to exit our shareholding in a manner that best achieves this objective.  As is the case with AIB, market conditions at this point are not supportive of any disposal.</p></reply>

The policy sets restrictions on the loan-to-value (LTV) and Loan-to-Income (LTI) ratios on products that can be offered by mortgage providers.  There are a number of exemptions allowed for within the CBI guidelines, for example, mortgage switchers or forbearance cases.  The banks are at liberty to use these exceptions to the extent they see fit, and will likely do so with consideration to their risk appetite, lending policies and overall strategy. </p>  <p>  As the deputy will understand, the macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending are designed, implemented and monitored by the Central Bank in its role as regulator of the Irish banking sector, and therefore fall outside of my remit as Minister for Finance.  Moreover, the Central Bank does not currently provide prudential lending disclosures on an industry-wide or institutional basis and there is no regulatory requirement for any bank to publicly disclose the value of approved mortgages that are exceptions to the macro-prudential limits.  My role as Minister of Finance, as set out in the Relationship Framework Agreements between the Minister and the banks in which the State is a shareholder, does not involve me in the relationship between the banks and their regulator.  It would therefore be inappropriate, and beyond my remit, for me to direct the disclosure of the information sought by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  However, I have received assurances from the banks in which the State has a shareholding that they have complied fully with Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Loan-to-Income (LTI) limits as set by the Central Bank during the year ending 31st December 2015, and that they continue to operate within the constraints set by their regulator.</p>  <p>  As laid out in the Programme for Government, my Department will work with the Central Bank in the context of its up-coming review of the mortgage lending limits and my officials will write to the Central Bank to suggest that it would be helpful if the Central Bank could make available aggregated data on mortgage lending since the macro-prudential rules came into operation.  This data, if available, would assist respondents in making evidence-based submissions to the Central Bank's consultation process.</p></reply>

As a result, the general government expenditure outturn for 2015 does mean that there is a significant buffer now built into the calculation of Ireland's compliance with the expenditure benchmark in 2016.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy is aware, the expenditure benchmark is only one of the two pillars used to assess compliance with the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The second pillar is the balanced budget rule, which requires a Member State to move towards its medium-term budgetary objective or MTO in accordance with its adjustment path.  The MTO is set in structural terms, which means it excludes the effects of the economic cycle and one-off transactions, such as the AIB transaction in 2015.</p>  <p>  In assessing compliance with the preventive arm of the SGP, the European Commission undertakes an overall assessment based on both pillars.  Given the one-off issue, it is possible that the Commission will place greater emphasis on the structural balance pillar for 2016 and not the expenditure benchmark as would normally be the case.  With regard to 2017 and beyond, the AIB transaction will have no effect as compliance with the expenditure benchmark will be measured by reference to the level of expenditure in 2016.</p></reply>

The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  Since revision in 2013 the CCMA requires all regulated lenders to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.  Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement or the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.  This gives co-operating borrowers time to consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.</p>  <p>  The combined effect of these two protections (an eight month protection period and a requirement for three months' notice) is that, for a co-operating borrower, legal proceedings may not commence until three months from the date the letter (setting out one of the above positions) is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later.  It is important to also note that the commencement of the court process is not a signal that a repossession will occur.  It may often be the case that the process then prompts re-engagement by borrowers with cases being adjourned to allow both parties time to find a sustainable solution.  Consequently, I would urge borrowers in arrears to contact the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) for free and confidential advice and support.</p></reply>

However, it considers these products in its risk and evidence-based approach to prioritising its work.  This ensures that it is focussing its resources on those areas where it considers there to be a significant threat to its consumer protection objectives.  This includes carrying out a comprehensive annual consumer risk assessment, whereby it examines each of the retail sectors regulated by the Central Bank to identify current and emerging risks.</p>  <p>  In general, whole-of-life policies are designed to provide consumers with life cover for their whole life.  As long as the policyholder makes regular payments sufficient to maintain the chosen benefits, this type of cover will pay a lump sum on the death of the policy holder.</p>  <p>  The regular payment into the plan covers the cost of providing the benefits chosen on the plan.  In the early years the payments are higher than the cost of the policyholder's benefits.  The extra money paid goes into the plan fund.  Protection benefits get more expensive as policy holders get older; usually as the plan progresses the payments begin to equal the cost of the chosen benefits.  In the later years of reviewable protection plans, the cost of the benefits increases significantly.  In order to keep the level of benefits at the current level of payments, the difference is made up from the plan fund.</p>  <p>  During its regular policy reviews, the insurance company assesses whether the consumer's current level of payment is sufficient to maintain the level of cover desired.</p></reply>

Activate is not aimed at social and affordable housing but at residential housing shortages in the main urban centres.  Activate's base lending rate is approximately 10% and, as would be expected there is participation in any equity upside if projects succeed.  This means that ISIF and by extension the taxpayer shares in any gains.</p>  <p>  In the area of social and affordable housing, ISIF is engaging across a wide range of stakeholders, including private sector investors, with a view to identifying opportunities to invest.  This is in accordance with the recently published Social Housing 2020 strategy paper which references the ISIF as a potential source of capital for the sector.</p>  <p>  Key factors which must be addressed to facilitate ISIF involvement in such projects include the commercial viability of proposals, Eurostat treatment of fund structures which receive the majority of their revenue from Government sources and the ability to create off-balance sheet vehicles, outside of the existing PPP model.</p>  <p>  Commercial investment of scale in the social and affordable housing sectors in Ireland has not evolved to the same extent in Ireland as it has in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.  To date no strategic and deliverable investments of scale have emerged.  ISIF inform me that they are actively engaging on a range of potential investment opportunities which have the potential to evolve into investments which meet ISIF's statutory mandate to invest on a commercial basis in a way that supports economic activity in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A review of the strategy of the ISIF will take place in the second half of 2016, after the first 18 months of the Fund's operations have elapsed.  A decision to conduct a review was based on its unique mandate as a sovereign development fund, with its double bottom line which is to invest: (i) on a commercial basis; and (ii) in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  The review will be conducted in accordance with the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 which provides that ownership of the Fund rests with the Minister for Finance.  The exact details of the process and timelines of the review have yet to be considered fully and decisions on these issues will be taken in the lead up to the review's commencement.</p></reply>

Primarily, these changes amended the scheme so that instead of providing for tax relief at an individual's marginal rate for an investment made in a qualifying company, a corporation tax credit is paid directly to a film producer company. </p>  <p>  The amount of the credit is 32% of the lowest of:</p>  <p>- eligible expenditure (which is generally the amount spent on the employment of eligible individuals, goods, services and facilities in the State),</p>  <p>- 80% of the total cost of production of the film, or</p>  <p>- &euro;70 million.</p>  <p>  The amount of the credit was increased to &euro;70 million with effect from 1st May 2016, from &euro;50 million.  This increase was made in recognition of the importance of Ireland's film industry to our cultural economy and aims to attract higher budget films to Ireland.  An increase to &euro;70 million struck an appropriate balance between providing a sufficient increase to attract big budget films, while also being mindful of the possible cost to the public finances if a number of such films were to come to Ireland. I intend to monitor the scheme to see the impact of these changes.</p></reply>

In December 2012, I contributed &euro;250m to the Credit Union Fund for the purpose of restructuring the credit union sector.  The placing of money in the Fund had no impact on the general Government deficit as it is only when this money is spent that it impacts the deficit.  This funding has always been ring-fenced specifically to provide financial support for restructuring credit unions.</p>  <p>  The terms of the Restructuring Scheme, agreed between the Department of Finance and DG Competition at the European Commission are specific to restructuring credit unions and are measures granted under a State aid scheme.  There is no flexibility within the Scheme to provide funding for any measure other than restructuring.  Therefore the deploying of funds for other uses would have State aid issues.</p>  <p>  In 2015, ReBo conducted a detailed analysis of likely funding requirements and it estimates that its net use of the Credit Union Fund will amount to no more than circa &euro;20m.  This will enable the return of circa &euro;230m to the Exchequer.  While it was envisaged that significant funding would be required for credit union restructuring, it is commendable that the credit union movement itself has provided funding from within its own resources for this purpose, thus minimising the requirement for drawing on Exchequer funding.</p>  <p>  ReBo continues to assist a large number of credit unions so its total expenditure will not be known for a number of months.  There are now 218 credit unions, spread across 118 projects that have either restructured or are actively restructuring.  Over 100 different credit unions have now successfully completed a transfer of engagements.</p>  <p>  My Department is always open to examining any proposals from the representative bodies or individual credit unions in relation to the development of a strengthened and revitalised credit union sector.  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

Last year I requested a report on the issue from the Central Bank.  The Report entitled 'Influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland' was subsequently published on the Department's website and is available here: <i>www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/Influences%20on%20SVR%20Pricing%20in%20Ireland.pdf</i>.</p><p>As you will be aware, I also met with the main mortgage lenders at that time and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to existing and new Irish mortgage customers was too high.  The banks agreed to review their rates and products and to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for standard variable rate customers.  The banks publish details of their interest rates on their websites.</p><p>In September 2015 I concluded a series of follow up meetings with these banks and I think that it is fair to say that there have been considerable movements in the mortgage offerings of the Irish banks in the last twelve months.</p><p>More particularly, for example, since May of last year AIB have reduced their SVR on three occasions.  There have also been cuts to loan-to-value variable rates and fixed rates at AIB, EBS and Haven as well as two SVR cuts at EBS and Haven.  Furthermore, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank have reduced their fixed rates for mortgage customers, while Permanent TSB introduced new Managed Variable Rates (MVRs) based on loan-to-value, which should represent reductions for SVR customers.  In addition, KBC reduced its SVR and fixed rates.  These are just a sample of the offers available to customers.</p><p>Many of the banks also have offers of cashback or contributions towards switching fees to encourage switching customers.  Furthermore, the fact that some of these measures have been announced recently is an illustration that competition does pressurise banks to make offers in order to attract and retain customers.</p><p>In this regard, I am pleased to note that a Central Bank statistical release of 10<sup>th</sup>June 2016 showed that Principal Dwelling House (PDH) mortgage rates fell across all instrument categories over the 12 month period ending in the first quarter of 2016.  The most pronounced fall was observed for standard variable rate mortgages which declined by 49 basis points to 3.64 per cent over the year ending Q1-2016.  Fixed rate PDH mortgage rates also declined, with rates fixed for 1-3 years falling by 34 basis points over the same period.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-23a.84.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062300065#WRB02000"><p>The Oireachtas Committee on Housing is to be commended for its work and the comprehensive review it has produced, which I and my officials will carefully study.</p>  <p>  The Government attaches great importance to addressing the issue of mortgage arrears and wants to keep families in their homes and avoid repossessions insofar as possible.  In this context, it is important to note that there are a number of protections already in place to protect borrowers in arrears.  In particular, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.</p>  <p>  The CCMA is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  When it was introduced initially the CCMA contained a six month (later extended to 12 months) moratorium for co-operating borrowers whose mortgage was in arrears (or pre-arrears).  This was revised in 2013 and replaced with a requirement that a lender is required to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose, before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.  Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement or the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.  This gives co-operating borrowers time to consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.</p>  <p>  The combined effect of these two protections (an eight month protection period and a requirement for three months' notice) is that, for a co-operating borrower, legal proceedings may not commence until three months from the date the letter (setting out one of the above positions) is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later.  It is important to also note that the commencement of the court process is not a signal that a repossession will occur.  It may often be the case that the process then prompts borrowers to re-engage with their bank and to find a solution.  Often these cases are adjourned to allow both parties time to find a sustainable solution.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.  The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory avenue to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.  If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.  Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to, insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.  Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.</p>  <p>  The numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.  Data released by the Central Bank on 10 June shows that to end-Q1 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last eleven quarters.  Some 120,447 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.  It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that borrower will be able to remain in their family home.  Consequently, I would urge borrowers in this situation to contact the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) who are in a position to provide free and confidential support to borrowers.</p></reply>

These documents are drafted and structured to ensure that the institutions will operate on a commercial basis and independent of the Minister in respect of their day to day operations.  The role of the Minister is also set out and reflects his shareholding in the relevant institution and also the other support provided to that institution.</p>  <p>  As a result the Minister has no statutory function in relation to the day to day banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution.</p>  <p>  However from a general policy perspective, the approach of the Government is to support people in genuine mortgage arrears and where feasible, to put in place a sustainable restructure to address and resolve such a difficulty.  This is clearly set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears where it requires a lender in respect of a cooperating borrower to explore all of the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by that lender and that a lender must document its consideration of each option examined and the reasons why the options offered or not offered to the borrower are, or are not appropriate and sustainable.</p>  <p>  If a solution cannot be agreed between borrower and lender, or if it is agreed that a mortgage restructure is not a sustainable solution, there are alternative mechanisms available to allow a debtor remain in the house in appropriate cases.  For example, the Mortgage to Rent scheme is available in cases where the house and household would be appropriate and eligible for social housing.  Where the borrower and lender cannot agree on a sustainable mortgage restructure, the debtor has the option to formulate and propose a PIA to his/her secured and other creditor(s).  This initiative rests solely with the debtor and in formulating a PIA, a personal insolvency practitioner is under an onus, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to formulate the proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy a principal private residence.</p></reply>

Ireland is also heavily involved in work to implement the remaining BEPS recommendations by way of a Multilateral Instrument that will update global tax treaties to ensure they are fully in line with agreed international best practice.  This instrument is expected to be open for signature by countries by the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  At the ECOFIN meeting last week I expressed my strong support for the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive which seeks to implement a number of the BEPS recommendations within the EU.  That Directive has now reached political agreement and work will now focus on implementing the measures contained in the Directive.</p></reply>

In this regard solid fuels, which have been traditionally favoured by household consumers, have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels and given the environmental impact it is important they are taxed.</p>  <p>  While the carbon tax was introduced for other fuels in 2010, its application to solid fuels did not occur until its  phased introduction in 2013 and 2014.</p>  <p>  Coupled with the long lead in period to the implementation of carbon tax on solid fuels, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland provide generous grants via Better Energy Homes scheme and also provides home energy upgrades free of charge to vulnerable households via Better Energy Warmer Homes to reduce dependence on combustion of fossil fuels for home heating.  The Better Energy Homes Scheme has to date provided over &euro;190m in funding to over 185,000 homes resulting in a reduced energy demand.</p>  <p>  These policies have contributed to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector which were 10.4% lower in 2014 compared with 2013 levels.  These reductions are mainly from decreased solid fuel consumption for space and hot water heating in homes in 2014 as well as increases in renewable energy consumption.</p>  <p>  Greenhouse gases are contributing to climate change and as a signatory to the UNCOP 21 Paris Agreement, Ireland has committed to play its part in reducing emissions. The carbon tax, as part of the overarching energy strategy, is a key tool towards meeting these commitments.  The carbon tax is deemed to be the most cost effective way of reducing overall emissions and therefore plays an important role of providing incentives for emission reduction activities in this regard. It is important therefore that the tax is levied on all fossil fuels fairly to encourage behavioural change.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I do not intend to exempt household fuel products from carbon tax.</p></reply>

Legal clarity was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions.  It provides that the overriding duty of all directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act. Therefore any future appointments by the State to the bank boards will continue to retain this duty notwithstanding the basis for the appointment.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently reviewing options in relation to the appointment procedures for bank directors having due regard  to distinct differences which exist from appointments to other State boards, not least the requirements of the Central Bank/SSM Fitness and Probity Regime and the requirement to have a broad set of expertise relevant to large regulated entities in an ever more complex regulatory environment.</p></reply>

For example, Public Private Partnership (PPP's) mean that we have vital infrastructure in place that contributes to our economic growth. Aside from the employment involved in its delivery, such infrastructure supports ongoing employment, both directly and indirectly. So the economy and the public finances benefit and this should be borne in mind.</p><p>As regards the cost to the Exchequer from unitary payments arising from PPP's, this is a matter, in the first instance, for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Paschal Donohoe. </p><p>However, my officials have been advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the Exchequer paid out about &euro;225 million of PPP unitary payments in 2015.

If not, the c. &euro;380 million level in 2021 will continue annually until about 2035 (indexed for inflation) before declining as PPP contracts are completed and drop out of the payments.</p><p>Furthermore, PPP costs are published in the Revised Estimates Volume each year, in the relevant subheads of the relevant Departments.</p></reply>

It has made positive progress on arrears reductions, with great than 90 day arrears in Homeloans c. 46% below peak levels in 2013.  PTSB returned to underlying profitability in 2015 for the first time since 2007 and it announced that it was profitable and capital generative in Q1, 2016 (&euro;39m Profit Before Tax).  </p>  <p>  This year the bank has launched a new brand proposition ("Keep Going"), a new mortgage product (the 3-in-1 mortgage) and a new current account ("Explore"), all are innovative and the two product initiatives are competitive and indications to date suggest the campaigns are being well received.  </p>  <p>  The current account product in particular represents an entirely new way of operating a current account in Ireland and features cash back for card usage (where other banks charge for card transactions), discounts from partners and rewards each week based on the actual patterns of account usage shown by the individual customers.</p>  <p>  The bank has also launched a consumer finance campaign and has indicated that it is developing plans in the digital space for the coming months.</p>  <p>  Permanent TSB is also in the midst of writing again to its existing residential mortgage customers to encourage them to move to the bank's new Managed Variable Rate products, c.15,000 customers have taken up this offer since last September and they are availing of reductions on their variable rate mortgages of a minimum of 0.20% and a max of 0.80%.  </p>  <p>  On the 21 December 2015 permanent tsb launched a new business banking offering which has been specially designed for small businesses of fewer than 50 employees and with a turnover of less than &euro;10 million.  This is the first comprehensive suite of business banking products launched by the bank since the financial crisis and reflects its strategy of focussing on the smaller end of the business banking market where there is considerable overlap between personal and small business accounts.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the positive progress made PTSB in many areas there are various challenges facing PTSB, including, but not limited to, the lower interest rate environment, the delayed disposal of CHL due to the UK referendum, increasing regulatory costs, the Central Bank tracker mortgage review, extension of the Bank Levy and higher provisions and lower growth in new lending than the market anticipated.</p>  <p>  I am of the view that the best way to protect the value of the State's shareholding is to ensure PTSB continues the progress it has made with a view to reaching sustainable operating profitability and an adequate Return on Equity (ROE) as soon as possible while striving to meet the terms of the European Commission restructuring plan.</p>  <p>  While I am strongly supportive of Permanent TSB in the delivery of their strategy I cannot discount the possibility that a strategic transaction could arise opportunistically at any time involving PTSB which could be in the best interests of the State.  As part of their day-to-day role officials in the Shareholding Management Unit will consider all credible proposals and develop strategic options relating to our banking investments and will also consider from time to time whether the sale of shares by way of placing would be beneficial for the State. Having said that I have no current plans to sell shares in PTSB, notwithstanding the flexibility to do so within the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously I would like to see more competition in the domestic banking system to provide the lending required for our growing economy and this could be achieved through new entrants or the continued growth of our domestic banks.</p></reply>

This postponement means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values. The postponement arose from one of the recommendations of the review.  </p>  <p>  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the remaining recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report to be considered in full. Local authorities receive income from a variety of sources including grants from Central Government, Local Property Tax allocations, commercial rates and other locally raised charges. </p>  <p>  Local Property Tax was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions and making the taxation system less dependent on other taxes. </p>  <p>  The Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than they received as General Purpose Grants from the Local Government Fund in 2014. This provides a level of certainty and stability in a time of significant change for the sector and will ensure that citizens will continue to receive an appropriate level of services from their local authorities. </p>  <p>  It is a positive outcome from the policy of local retention of LPT that local authorities can use LPT proceeds to pay for local services which were funded by the Central Government in the past. This facilitates further implementation of the overall objective of the local government reform programme, which is greater devolution to the local government sector, through supporting enhanced local decision making on spending priorities. </p>  <p>  My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill Review in due course. I also note that the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the preparation of a report by mid-2017 for Government and for the Oireachtas, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability.</p>  <p>  I have no plans for the abolition of the Local Property Tax. </p></reply>

The rationale behind the relief is to enable farmers to consolidate disparate holdings of farmland in order to make their farming business more productive and efficient. To amend the relief, as proposed in the question, to cover discrete sales of parcels of land unconnected to farm consolidation would run completely counter to the reasons behind the introduction of the restructuring relief.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate the concerns behind the Deputy's proposal, I do not intend, for the reasons outlined, to extend the relief in the manner proposed. It would also be invidious to introduce a new CGT relief in respect of asset disposals by farmers which did not apply to other taxpayers in similar situations. Aside from any other considerations, current resources would not allow for such a broad-based tax concession.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully aware of the pressures on farmers right now and my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Mr Michael Creed TD, has committed to working with all players in the sector, both at national and EU level, to address these issues and ensure that we continue to have a sustainable and resilient sector. I understand that Minister Creed recently met with the CEOs of the main banks and stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility. The banks told the Minister that they recognise and are responding to the challenges facing farmers in this regard.</p>  <p>  Finally, I also believe that, in response to the current market difficulties, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has this week launched the 'Financial Management Initiative', as recently agreed by the Dairy Forum (comprising farm organisations, co-ops and processors, the Department and its agencies, as well as the banking sector). It is a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers.</p></reply>

This postponement means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values. The postponement arose from one of the recommendations of the review.</p>  <p>  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the remaining recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report to be considered in full. Local authorities receive income from a variety of sources including grants from Central Government, Local Property Tax allocations, commercial rates and other locally raised charges.</p>  <p>  Local Property Tax was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions and making the taxation system less dependent on other taxes. </p>  <p>  The Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than they received as General Purpose Grants from the Local Government Fund in 2014. This provides a level of certainty and stability in a time of significant change for the sector and will ensure that citizens will continue to receive an appropriate level of services from their local authorities. </p>  <p>  It is a positive outcome from the policy of local retention of LPT that local authorities can use LPT proceeds to pay for local services which were funded by the Central Government in the past. This facilitates further implementation of the overall objective of the local government reform programme, which is greater devolution to the local government sector, through supporting enhanced local decision making on spending priorities. </p>  <p>  My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill Review in due course.  I also note that the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the preparation of a report by mid-2017 for Government and for the Oireachtas, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability.</p>  <p>  I have no plans for the abolition of the Local Property Tax. </p></reply>

The rationale behind the relief is to enable farmers to consolidate disparate holdings of farmland in order to make their farming business more productive and efficient. To amend the relief, as proposed in the question, to cover discrete sales of parcels of land unconnected to farm consolidation would run completely counter to the reasons behind the introduction of the restructuring relief.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate the concerns behind the Deputy's proposal, I do not intend, for the reasons outlined, to extend the relief in the manner proposed. It would also be invidious to introduce a new CGT relief in respect of asset disposals by farmers which did not apply to other taxpayers in similar situations. Aside from any other considerations, current resources would not allow for such a broad-based tax concession.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully aware of the pressures on farmers right now and my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Mr Michael Creed TD, has committed to working with all players in the sector, both at national and EU level, to address these issues and ensure that we continue to have a sustainable and resilient sector. I understand that Minister Creed recently met with the CEOs of the main banks and stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility. The banks told the Minister that they recognise and are responding to the challenges facing farmers in this regard.</p>  <p>  Finally, I also believe that, in response to the current market difficulties, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has this week launched the 'Financial Management Initiative', as recently agreed by the Dairy Forum (comprising farm organisations, co-ops and processors, the Department and its agencies, as well as the banking sector). It is a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers.</p></reply>

However, other units may also be classified to the government sector if they are controlled by Government and if they are classified as "non-market producers". The General Government sector thus encompasses both Central and Local Government, non-commercial state owned bodies and extra budgetary funds.</p>  <p>  All borrowing by this general government sector, regardless of the way it is used, is included in general government debt (GGD). The yearly cost of servicing GGD is detailed in the Central Statistics Office (CSO) Government Finance Statistics April 2016 and forecasts out to 2021 are included in my Department's Stability Programme Update April 2016 - see interest expenditure in Table A2.2 in Annex 1.</p>  <p>  Other bodies that are considered "market" institutional units but are controlled by Government (e.g. ESB, AIB) are classified in the 'commercial Public Sector'. The borrowing of these entities is not government debt and is serviced by these bodies from their own commercial activity. Similarly borrowings by the private partner related to a PPP or other similar project in partnership with government is not government debt and the yearly cost of servicing these borrowings is the responsibility of the private partner.</p></reply>

The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment. In this regard solid fuels, which have been traditionally favoured by household consumers, have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important they are taxed.  While the carbon tax was introduced for transport fuels in December 2009, its application to solid fuels was delayed to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply. Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the carbon tax was then applied to solid fuel on a phased basis in 2013 and 2014.Coupled with the long lead in period to the implementation of carbon tax on solid fuels generous grants have also been provided, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, via Better Energy Homes and also provides home energy upgrades free of charge to vulnerable households via Better Energy Warmer Homes to reduce dependence on combustion of fossil fuels for home heating.  The Better Energy Homes Scheme has to date provided over &euro;190m in funding to over 185,000 homes resulting in a reduced energy demand. The carbon tax, as part of the overarching energy strategy, is a key tool to reduce emissions towards meeting our climate change commitments.  Greenhouse gases are contributing to climate change and as a signatory to the UNCOP 21 Paris Agreement, Ireland has committed to play its part in reducing emissions.  The carbon tax is deemed to be the most cost effective way of reducing overall emissions and therefore plays an important role in providing incentives for emission reduction activities in this regard, and it is important the tax is levied on all fossil fuels fairly to encourage behavioural changes.  Accordingly, I do not intend to reduce the rate of carbon tax.</p></reply>

Over the period to 2021, the split in the use of fiscal space between spending and tax reductions is broadly in line with the Government Programme commitment of 2 to 1. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, there is a commitment in the PPG to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the USC as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners. Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners. </p><p>The PPG states that reductions in personal tax rates - such as the phasing out of the USCneeded to reward work and support enterprise and employment will be funded largely through:</p><p>- Extra revenues from not indexing personal tax credits and bands</p><p>- The removal of PAYE tax credit for high earners and other measures to ensure the tax system remains fair and progressive</p><p>- Higher excise duties on cigarettes and increased enforcement and sanctions on the illegal importation and sale of cigarettes</p><p>- Increased enforcement and sanctions on fuel laundering</p><p>- A new tax on sugar sweetened drinks</p><p>- Improving tax compliance</p><p>Work on development of the medium-term income tax reform plan is ongoing and as such the expected cost is not yet finalised.  The plan is due to be published for consultation with the Oireachtas Committee on Finance in July, and for approval by the Oireachtas in October.</p><p>The revenue to be raised by planned offsetting tax changes, such as a sugar-sweetened drinks tax for example, will depend on, among other things, the rate at which the tax is set and the scope of its application.  These issues are budgetary matters which will be determined through the budgetary process.</p><p>The income tax reform plan will aim to support job creation and reward work which is a key driver of growth and prosperity in the economy.

As part of this review, a public consultations process was conducted in 2014 to which there was a significant response with substantive and wide-ranging views received about the law and practice in respect of judicial appointments.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, any new proposed legislation in this area will also be the subject of full consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny so there will be ample further opportunity for interested persons and groups to express their further views in relation to the matter. </p>  <p>  There are currently eight vacancies in the various courts and further vacancies will arise before the end of this year.  I am currently considering the best approach not only in relation to filling the existing vacancies but also in terms of bringing forward the reform legislation.  The Deputy will appreciate that while I cannot be definitive in respect of this issue today, I can say that the Government is likely to determine the approach to be taken on this matter in the coming weeks taking all of the relevant matters into account.</p></reply>

Where a sex offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years or more, he or she will be subject to notification requirements for a period of indefinite duration.</p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Act allows the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to the Court for a Sex Offender Order where a sex offender has acted on one or more occasion in such a way as to give reasonable grounds for believing that an order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from him or her.  A Sex Offender Order can prohibit the sex offender from doing a thing or things specified in that order where the Court considers it to be necessary to do so to protect the public from serious harm. It would be open to the Court to impose restrictions on where a sex offender, subject to a Sex Offender Order, may frequent or reside.</p>  <p>  Part 5 of the Act makes provision for a Court, when sentencing a convicted sex offender to a term of imprisonment, to include in the sentence a period of post-release supervision. The conditions which a Court may attach to a post-release supervision order may prohibit the offender from doing one or more things specified in the order where the Court considers it necessary to protect the public from serious harm.  The Probation Service supervises offenders who are subject to court ordered community supervision. Conditions attached to the supervision order may include restrictions on living in certain areas.</p></reply>

They were asked to make a contribution to the cost of implementing the Magdalen Laundries Restorative Justice Ex-Gratia Scheme. Following reflection on the matter all four congregations declined to make a financial contribution towards the implementation of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  The matter was discussed again by the Government on 16 July 2013 and following that meeting the then Minister wrote to all four congregations expressing his disappointment that they had decided not to make a financial contribution, pointing out that the Government was of the view that the congregations had a moral obligation to do so and urging them to reconsider. The congregations responded to that second request reaffirming their previous position.</p>  <p>  Further letters issued to the religious congregations in January 2014 and they again reaffirmed their position that they would not be making a financial contribution to the Scheme.</p>  <p>  All four religious congregations are cooperating fully with the scheme with regard to providing the appropriate records available to applicants.

While the report and recommendations from counsel were not provided to complainants, I had sought to ensure that letters to complainants informing them of the outcome of the review of their particular complaints should set out the recommendation of counsel and also outline, as far as possible, the reasons for that recommendation. To that end I appointed a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of the letters and independently vouch for the fact that the summaries of conclusions and the reasoning behind them are a fair reflection of counsel's advice.</p>  <p>  In the case referred to in the Deputy's questions, counsel recommended a non-statutory inquiry.  I accepted this recommendation and informed the complainant of my decision. Subsequently, in consultation with the Attorney General on this and the other cases where an inquiry was recommended, I decided that a statutory inquiry under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act would be a more effective instrument for such an inquiry.  This fact was communicated to the person concerned on 18 May, 2016.</p>  <p>  The advantage of a statutory inquiry under section 42 is that it provides a legislative framework in terms of the powers available to the person appointed to carry out the inquiry.  These include the power to inquire into any aspect of the administration, operation, practice, procedure or conduct of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Other powers granted to the inquiry include the power to compel any person in possession of information relevant to the inquiry to provide it; and the power to require the attendance of any person before the inquiry.  These powers are supported by statutory recourse to the High Court in certain circumstances.</p>  <p>  I am currently consulting with the Attorney General about the terms of reference for the inquiry and I will be in further contact with the person referred to in due course.</p></reply>

Insurance companies are required under European law to price in accordance with risk and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct insurance companies on the pricing or the provision of insurance products. </p>  <p>  The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States adopting rules which require the prior approval or systematic notification of certain matters, including general and special policy conditions and scales of premiums.  Furthermore, the EU framework provides non-life insurers with the freedom to set premiums.  This has been acknowledged by the European Court of Justice. </p>  <p>  Insurance companies consider a number of risks when determining the premium for a proposed insurance policy, whether that is a general insurance policy such as motor or home insurance, or a life assurance policy.  A premium is based on the actuarial calculation of risk. </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland motor insurers in making decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, use a combination of rating factors such as the age of the driver, the type of car, claims record, driving experience, number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market and consumers are free to choose. </p>  <p>  The Equal Status Acts prohibit certain kinds of discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, obtaining or disposing of accommodation and in relation to educational establishments.  The legislation protects against discrimination on nine specific grounds, including age.</p>  <p>  However, the legislation also provides that people can be treated differently on any grounds in relation to insurance, covering annuities, pensions, insurance policies and other matters relating to risk assessment but only if the differences are based on actuarial or statistical data or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors and are reasonable and not based on gender.</p>  <p>  Finally, in the event that a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland (01 6761820) quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.  Under this Agreement, the Declined Cases Committee of Insurance Ireland deals with cases of difficulty in obtaining motor insurance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-23a.261.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062300069#WRF00500"><p>The Government attaches great importance to addressing the issue of mortgage arrears and wants to keep families in their homes and avoid repossessions insofar as possible.  In this context, it is important to note that there are a number of protections already in place to protect borrowers in arrears.  In particular, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. </p>  <p>  The CCMA is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act, 1989. The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.  </p>  <p>  When it was introduced initially the CCMA contained a six month (later extended to 12 months) moratorium for co-operating borrowers whose mortgage was in arrears (or pre-arrears).  This was revised in 2013 and replaced with a requirement that a lender is required to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose, before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.  Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement or the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.  This gives co-operating borrowers time to consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement. </p>  <p>  The combined effect of these two protections (an eight month protection period and a requirement for three months' notice) is that, for a co-operating borrower, legal proceedings may not commence until three months from the date the letter (setting out one of the above positions) is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later.  It is important to also note that the commencement of the court process is not a signal that a repossession will occur   it may often be the case that the process then prompts borrowers to re-engage with their bank and to find a solution.  Often these cases are adjourned to allow both parties time to find a sustainable solution.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.   The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory avenue to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.  If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.  Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to,  insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.  Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.</p>  <p>  The numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.  Data released by the Central Bank on 10 June shows that to end-Q1 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last eleven quarters.  Some 120,447 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.  It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that borrower will be able to remain in their family home.  Consequently, I would urge borrowers in this situation to contact the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) who are in a position to provide free and confidential support to borrowers. </p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. The Medical Board of Appeal's clinical determination is limited to the scope of the six qualifying criteria, and the Board does not have discretion in relation to the application of these criteria. The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014. These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities. I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria. While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

The fiscal forecast contained in the SES has been updated for a number of budgetary developments.  Since publication of the 2016 Stability Programme Update, the allocation for voted expenditure has increased by &euro;540 million. This allows for an expenditure increase in the areas of Health, which is receiving &euro;500 millon, and Justice, which has been allocated a further &euro;40 million. Also in the interim, the tax revenue performance has been strong and at end-May 2016, receipts were up &euro;774 million or 4.3 per cent above profile, which represents a 9.0 per cent (&euro;1,549 million) increase when compared to same period in 2015. This solid performance was reviewed as part of the 2016 Summer Economic Statement and it was decided that the strong performance facilitates an increase of c. &euro;900 million in this years tax forecast. </p>  <p>  This more than offsets the increase in voted expenditure and helps to improve the estimate of the general government deficit for 2016 from 1.1% of GDP to 0.9% of GDP.  However, I should point out that not all of the additional tax revenue received to date is of a recurring nature and therefore will not enter the tax base for 2017.  </p>  <p>  In terms of 2017, the SES estimates that fiscal space of &euro;1 billion will be available and this has been allocated to expenditure increases and tax reductions, in the fiscal forecast, on a 2:1 basis. This is in line with the Programme for Partnership Government. </p>  <p>  A further update to the forecasts for 2016 and 2017 will be contained in the Budget 2017 booklet using the most up to date macroeconomic and fiscal information available at that time.</p></reply>

The most recent data published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on June 9<sup>th</sup>shows that inflation has been relatively muted over the past year. The the annual rate of inflation, as measured by their harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) decreased by 0.2 per cent in May 2016 compared to the same month last year. This reflects a low monthly  inflation rate, of 0.5 per cent, seasonally adjusted, between April and May 2016.</p><p>The low annual rate of inflation in Ireland, at -0.2 per cent, which is in line with that of the euro area, at -0.1 per cent, in the 12 months to May 2016, has been mainly driven by falling energy prices. However, annual HICP core inflation (excluding energy prices and unprocessed food) in Ireland increased slightly to 0.9 per cent in May, which is in line with that of the euro area at 0.8 per cent.</p><p>The Stability Programme Update published in April 2016 shows inflation increasing moderately over the year, with HICP inflation of 0.4 per cent forecast for 2016. This is broadly consistent with the rest of the EU.</p></reply>

In the Stability Programme Update, published at the end of April, my Department forecast that the economy would grow by 4.9 per cent in 2016 and by 3.9 per cent in 2017.  Furthermore, over the remainder of the forecast horizon out to 2021, growth rates are forecast to move towards its potential growth rate, estimated at around 3<sup>1</sup><sub>/2</sub>per cent per annum.</p><p>Importantly, economic activity is now more balanced between domestic and external sources of growth.  While the recovery in economic performance was initially led by the export sector, domestic demand is now making a strong contribution.  This is very important as the domestic sectors are both jobs rich and tax rich.</p><p>The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had fourteen successive quarters of employment growth.  Last year, employment increased by 2.6 per cent, equivalent to 50,000 new jobs.</p><p>Recent data published indicate that:</p><p>-  The volume of retail sales increased by 5.1 per cent year-on-year in April 2016.</p><p>-  New cars licensed for the first time were up almost 25 per cent to end-May year-on-year.</p><p>-  The Purchasing Managers' Index showed continued expansion in the construction sector.</p><p>-  While consumer sentiment has moderated somewhat it still remains well above the long-run average.</p><p>-  Employment grew by 2.4 per cent over the year to Q1 2016, equivalent to an increase of 46,900 jobs.</p><p>-  The  unemployment rate fell to 7.8 per cent in May, seasonally adjusted, down from 9.6 per cent a year earlier.  This is the lowest rate of unemployment since December 2008.</p><p>The positive outlook for Ireland's economic prospects is shared by the 3 major credit ratings agencies.  Following Moody's upgrade to an A rating, all 3 have now given an A-Grade to Ireland's sovereign debt.</p><p>However, there are several sources of uncertainty.  Weaker than expected trading partner growth would negatively impact on Irish growth through reduced exports.  Growth in Emerging Market Economies disappointed in 2015, and while Ireland's direct trade exposure remains relatively small, we would be exposed to a more generalised slowdown in the world economy.  The upcoming referendum on EU membership in the UK is another downside risk facing the Irish economy with Ireland potentially more exposed than most to a UK exit.  Figures published this month showed a deceleration in merchandise trade which may be indicative of a delayed spillover from the slowdown in global trade observed in 2015.  Net goods exports, however, continue to contribute positively.</p><p>Domestically, the high level of private debt, while falling, remains a concern, and any deterioration in the external environment could prompt households and firms to raise the pace of deleveraging, with adverse implications for domestic demand.</p><p>This uncertainty highlights the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.</p><p>In summary, I am satisfied that the economic indicators remain stable and broadlyconsistent with the outlook parameters in the Stability Programme Update published in April.  However, this is critically contingent upon implementing appropriate polices and that is what the Government intends to do.</p></reply>

One such measure was the &euro;500 million Activate Capital joint venture between ISIF and KKR to make funding available to the house building sector.  Another key measure was NAMA's commitment to support the delivery, on a commercial basis, of up to 20,000 residential units by the end of 2020.  While there is evidence of a pick-up in housing supply, it is clear that the level of supply is currently not sufficient to restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium resulting in rising house prices.</p>  <p>  In the Programme for Government, an ambitious target has been set of ensuring that 25,000 additional new houses are built each year by 2020.  To achieve this target, the Government has committed to implementing a number of policy actions designed to help address the outstanding bottlenecks in the housing and construction sector.  The Government has already began to fulfil its commitment with the recent announcement of a &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Fund.  This fund will provide local authorities with the access to finance needed to address local public infrastructure deficits thereby opening up sites for development and improving the viability of construction in the residential market.  The local infrastructure fund reflects the proactive approach which this Government will continue to take as it seek to address the remaining issues in the housing market.</p>  <p>  The Government is currently taking into account the final recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness and the input from a number of relevant stakeholders as it develops the Action Plan for Housing.  Once published, the plan will include a number of time bound and targeted actions designed to expedite the construction process and boost housing supply. By addressing supply constraints throughout the residential market, housing should become more affordable for potential house purchasers.</p></reply>

The current Central Bank residential mortgage lending regulations has regard to the particular situation of first time buyers and provide for a lower deposit requirement for first time buyers of a primary home property compared to other residential mortgage borrowers.  For first time buyers, a 90 per cent LTV limit applies on the first &euro;220,000 value of a property and an 80 per cent LTV limit applies on any value of the property thereafter.  For non-first time buyers of a primary home, a flat 80% LTV threshold applies and for buy to let borrowers a 70% LTV threshold applies.  However, lenders also have a certain limited flexibility to, at their discretion, to exceed these thresholds when lending to credit worthy borrowers.</p><p>However, it is important to keep the <font color="#656565">requirements</font>of first time buyers under consideration.  As the Deputy is aware, the new Programme for a Partnership Government (PfPG) provides for a range of measures which seeks to improve the supply of housing and to protect and promote home ownership.  In particular, it indicates that the Government submission to the Central Bank will include a request to consider a &quot;capacity to pay&quot; (e.g. the payment capacity of potential purchasers based on rent paid over a five year period to be off set against the current deposit rules).  The Central Bank has now commenced this macro prudential review process and my Department will engage with the Central Bank on this.  </p><p>It could also be noted that recent mortgage lending data from the BPFI indicates that, in the first quarter of 2016, lending to first time buyers amounted to &euro;462 million which was higher that the &euro;405 million in credit which was extended to mover purchaser borrowers.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated entity.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises.  The Act means that any purchasers of loans books are required either to become regulated themselves by the Central Bank or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans.</p>  <p>  The Act also ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  It also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit firm to perform such an action, thereby further enhancing the consumer's protections.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is now the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of credit servicing firms. Credit servicing firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including the various codes mentioned already and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).</p>  <p>  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have:</p>  <p>  -  Robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance;</p>  <p>  -  Agreements with loan owners that enable the credit servicing firm to fully comply with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation; and</p>  <p>  -  Adequate and effective control of loan servicing in the State to enable Central Bank oversight. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides protections for borrowers who endeavour to meet their commitments in relation to their mortgages and the 2015 Act ensures that these protections apply when a loan has been sold.</p>  <p>  The CCMA sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his/her mortgage obligations.  The CCMA sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears.</p></reply>

The latest figures from Eurostat, the statistics arm of the European Commission, estimated that nominal unit labour costs (a widely used measure of competitiveness internationally) in Ireland declined by 4.2 per cent annually in 2015.  This is the largest decline across all EU Member States for which data are available. </p>  <p>  The decline in unit labour costs in 2015 is a continuation of the trend of significant improvement in Ireland's economy-wide cost competitiveness since 2008 (the peak year for unit labour costs in Ireland). It is estimated that nominal unit labour costs in Ireland fell by 20 percent between 2008 and 2015. This compares with an increase of 9 per cent in the UK and in the euro area over the same period.</p>  <p>  In addition, relatively low consumer price inflation in recent years has contributed to the improvement in Ireland's competitiveness as Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to those of our euro area peers.  For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below or equal that of the euro area every year since 2008. </p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth.  In this regard we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the recent strengthening of the euro against sterling.  Similarly gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  This highlights the importance of maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies to help address emerging uncertainties.</p></reply>

Last year I requested a report on the issue from the Central Bank. The Report entitled, 'Influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland' was subsequently published on the Department's website and is available here: <i>. </i></p><p>This research identified three main reasons for higher rates in Ireland.  First, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks. In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues.  Profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.</p><p>I also met with the main mortgage lenders in May last year and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to existing and new Irish mortgage customers was too high.  The banks agreed to review their rates and products and to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for standard variable rate customers.  In September 2015 I concluded a series of follow up meetings with these banks and I think that it is fair to say that there have been considerable movements in the mortgage offerings of the Irish banks in the last twelve months.  Furthermore, the fact that some of these offers have been announced recently is a vivid illustration of the effectiveness of the Government's policy, that competition is the best way to put pressure on the banks to reduce rates. </p><p>In this regard, I am pleased to note that a Central Bank statistical release of 10 June 2016 showed that Principal Dwelling House (PDH) mortgage rates fell across all instrument categories over the 12 month period ending in the first quarter of 2016.  The most pronounced fall was observed for standard variable rate mortgages which declined by 49 basis points to 3.64 per cent over the year ending Q1-2016.  Fixed rate PDH mortgage rates also declined, with rates fixed for 1-3 years falling by 34 basis points over the same period.</p></reply>

The majority of these impacted accounts were redressed before the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  There are three elements to the redress referred to above:</p>  <p>  -  In the first place, redress refers to the process whereby the bank calculates the difference between the amounts actually paid in respect of the mortgage accounts since the bank failure took place and the amount that would have required to be paid had the failure not occurred.  In order, any overpayment that is identified  is set against any arrears on the account, or repaid to the relevant mortgage account, or where there are excess funds, repaid directly  to the relevant account holders.  This approach ensures that the mortgage account is correctly restored to the position it would have been in had the failure not occurred.</p>  <p>  -  Secondly, redress refers to the payment of compensation to relevant account holders.</p>  <p>  -  Thirdly redress refers to the payment of &euro;400 to account holders for use, at their discretion, for independent financial advice.</p>  <p>  Separately PTSB has put in place a comprehensive, independent appeals process to ensure that account holders who are unhappy with the bank's redress in this matter can seek an independent review of that redress.</p>  <p>  Following this event last Summer, PTSB publicly announced that it had established a Mortgage Product Review Group (MPRG) to review the banks mortgage book in order to identify any other cases where the contractual terms and conditions attached to mortgage accounts were not being fully honoured by the bank or whether other material issues such as the provision of key information at relevant times require further examination.  This work is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  PTSB is also participating fully in a separate CBI led review of tracker mortgages across all the main Irish banks.</p></reply>

In November 2015 the Central Bank published a report, the Consumer Protection Bulletin on Current Accounts, showing the operation of this code under a number of headings.  This report is available on the Central Bank's website.</p><p>All credit institutions providing current accounts in Ireland are subject to the Switching Code, which was introduced by the Central Bank in October 2010.  Its purpose is to make the process of switching current accounts easier and quicker for consumers. In H1-2015, 99% of all current account switches were completed within the timeframes prescribed by the Code (which includes the transfer of all direct debits and standing orders).</p><p>The annualised figures for switching under the Code given in the Consumer Protection Bulletin are in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>4,8612012</td><td>8,0892013</td><td>15,0092014</td><td>32,571 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Central Bank do not have figures prior to 2011 and its most recent number is 5,374 for H1 2015.  </p><p>I understand that there was a spike in numbers using the switching process in H2-2013 and H1-2014 which coincided with the withdrawal of current account providers from the market.</p><p>The report shows a total number of current accounts at H2 2013 of 5,429,498 meaning that 0.28% switched accounts using the Code in 2013. The total number of accounts at H2 2014 was 5,423,063 meaning that 0.61% switched using the Code in 2014. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the EU Payment Accounts Directive introduces a number of provisions in relation to payment accounts, including the need to have a clear, quick and safe procedure for consumers who wish to move their payment account from one payment service provider to another.  The Directive must be transposed by 18 September 2016 and my Department is working with the Central Bank on how best to give effect to this requirement on switching.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to discourage over-funding and over-accrual of pension benefits through tax-relieved and tax-subsidised arrangements.  The regime achieves this by imposing a significant tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. </p>  <p>  When the SFT limit was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 to a level of &euro;2.3 million, with effect from 7 December 2010, and was further reduced in Budget and Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 to &euro;2 million, with effect from 1 January 2014, the clear legal advice to the Government (as at the time of the original introduction of the regime in 2005) was that an individual who had pension rights in excess of the SFT limit at the relevant dates was entitled to protect or "grandfather" those rights.  Accordingly, the legislation provided that such individuals could protect their higher pension values, subject to certain ceilings and conditions, by applying to Revenue for a PFT certificate. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is seeking to establish the cumulative level of protection afforded and the estimated tax foregone resulting from the grandfathering arrangements outlined above.  In relation to the tax foregone as a result of the PFT legislation, the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to compute this figure for a number of reasons such as, the fact that it is not known when exactly the individuals who have PFT's will retire; what tax free lump sums, if any, they may be entitled to take from their pension fund; what the tax rate will be when they retire and the size of their pension fund at retirement.  </p>  <p>  The concept of "tax foregone" is arguably more applicable in the context of tax reliefs where there is a choice as to whether to pursue the particular policy stance or not.  In that regard, it is important to note that these grandfathering arrangements were not considered optional and were provided in the legislation following legal advice to that effect from the Attorney General.  In other words, introducing the SFT regime to put an end to the provision of excessive pension pots at the expense of the general body of taxpayers required the simultaneous protection of pension rights that had been built up legitimately by individuals under the tax provisions that applied up to the relevant dates.  This was the firm legal advice to the Government when the SFT was introduced and on each subsequent occasion that the SFT limit was reduced.  The choice, therefore, was to introduce the SFT regime with grandfathering or not at all. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that in 2015 they issued a total of 501 PFT certificates with a total value of &euro;1,107 million.  The combined overall total number and value of PFT certificates issued since 7 December 2010 is 1,584 and &euro;4,387 million, respectively. </p>  <p>  The cumulative additional value of pension benefits protected in 2015 as compared with the SFT limits applying amounted to &euro;105 million.  The cumulative additional value of pension benefits protected as compared with the SFT limits applying at 7 December 2010 and 1 January 2014, respectively, amounts to &euro;942 million.    </p></reply>

However, for the Deputy's convenience I've outlined below the various options open to the student.</p><p>1. SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland)</p><p>Under the terms of the statutory based student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p><p>  The eligibility of the individual to which the Deputy refers is a matter for SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine; upon receipt of the relevant application form and supporting documentation. </p><p>  The SUSI online application process for 2016/17 is now open. Perspective students are advised to apply to SUSI (www.susi.ie) before the priority closing date of the 8th of July.</p><p>2. Pilot Support Scheme</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of my Department's Pilot Support Scheme which is targeted at students in the Protection System or at the Leave to Remain (but not deportation order) stage.  Students who do not qualify for support under the statutory based scheme may be eligible to apply for this pilot scheme. </p><p>  To qualify for this scheme prospective students have to meet a number of criteria, including a requirement to have:</p><p>-  5 years in the Protection system at the 31st of August 2016;</p><p>-  5 years in the Irish school system as at the 31st of August 2016; and</p><p>-  have obtained a Leaving Certificate.</p><p>  The closing date for receipt of applications for the 2016/17 academic year is 4th November 2016.

While the numbers of psychologists have steadily increased over the past ten years despite expenditure constraints, the numbers of pupils enrolled in school has also grown rapidly.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits that we will invest additional resources in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents.  The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173.</p>  <p>  NEPS provides service to schools via a network of some 23 local and regional offices serving schools in their respective catchment areas.  Vacancies most commonly occur within these offices through the resignation or retirement of psychologist staff and are filled through the application of an internal staff transfer mechanism (which moves the vacancy to the location of the staff member transferring in) and ultimately through appointment of a new psychologist from a regional panel maintained by the Public Appointments Service for this purpose.</p>  <p>  Currently there are 8 psychologist posts vacant within NEPS for more than two months (specifically one vacancy for 10, 9, 7 and 5 months, a further two vacancies for 3 months and two for 2 months).  As stated above schools affected by these vacancies are afforded access to the SCPA panel for assessment services and may treat in respect of other service needs with their local NEPS office.</p>  <p>  My Department is actively engaged with the Public Appointments Service to recruit psychologists to NEPS from the existing regional panels of qualified professionals developed for this purpose and it is envisaged that most of these posts will be filled in the immediate future.  Where these panels prove unable to satisfy local recruitment requirements I can inform the Deputy that arrangements are being put in place to run a new national recruitment competition in late summer/early autumn to answer all current and medium term needs of the NEPS service.</p></reply>

However, the significant increase in student numbers has resulted in a decrease in the level of funding resource per student.  It is estimated that at current student numbers, it would cost in the region of &euro;240 million to restore the level of resource per student to 2010 levels.  In addition, an estimate of the additional State funding required over the next five year period to accommodate likely growth in numbers is detailed in the following table. </p><p><b>Table 1: Core Income of HEA-funded HEIs</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total Core Funding</th><th>Student Numbers (FTE)</th><th>Funding per Student</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;1,871</td><td>173,417</td><td>&euro;10,789</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;1,850</td><td>177,780</td><td>&euro;10,406</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;1,881</td><td>181,960</td><td>&euro;10,337</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;1,840</td><td>183,809</td><td>&euro;10,010</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;1,802</td><td>187,421</td><td>&euro;9,615</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;1,831</td><td>192,294</td><td>&euro;9,522</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Estimates Costs for Restoration and Demographics</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Current Cost (m)</th></tr><tr><td>Restore per capita levels</td><td>&euro;240</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;12.3</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;12.6</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>&euro;12.8</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>&euro;14.4</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>&euro;16.2</td></tr></table>1.

The use of school facilities must be approved by the school authority.</p>  <p>  In 2005, my Department issued a circular to Trustees, Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Voluntary Secondary Schools (Circular Letter Prim 16/05) to encourage Trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community, education and recreation purposes.  This circular recognises that the decision ultimately lies with the relevant Board or Trustees and that the first priority at all times should be the interest of the school, its teachers and pupils.</p>  <p>  In facilitating such extra provision there are a number of complex issues that need to be considered in respect of such arrangements.  These issues - including property, governance, insurance and liability - are being considered as part of a review within my Department of the requirements to be established around the use of school premises/property for pre-school and after school services and the preparation of guidelines in relation to same.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware, there are key commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government (May 2016) in relation to encouraging the use of school buildings in this respect and the Government has committed to delivering progress on this within the first 100 days.  My Department is also working closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in relation to these commitments in order to facilitate the use of school premises outside of the school day.</p></reply>

Good progress has been made on implementation of the Charter objectives, as set out below under a number of key headings.</p><p>A - The Arts in Education Portal <i>(</i>www.artsineducation.ie<i>)</i>: Ireland's first Arts in Education Portal, the key national digital resource for arts in education in Ireland, was launched in May 2015.  Since its launch up to the end of March 2016, there have been 18,145 visitors (per session) with 43,295 page views, an average of nearly 4,000 page views per month.  A celebration and demonstration of the success of the Portal formed part of the National Arts in Education Day, held at The Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) on 23rd April 2016.</p><p>B - Teacher &ndash; Artist Partnership as a model for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) initiative: An important development is the more focused attention to helping artists and teachers to develop together their understanding, expertise and creative pitch for arts in education work for children at different age levels.  A significant initiative in this regard was the initiation in 2014 by the Charter Group of a pioneering programme of joint teacher - artist collaboration in continuing professional development.  The scheme, 'Exploring Teacher Artist Partnership as a Model of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Supporting and Enhancing Arts Education', commenced in 2014.  It is intended that the Education Centres, responsible for local delivery of national programmes of teacher professional development on behalf of my Department, will have the capacity to implement this model locally and regionally into the future.  This will be possible through strategic planning involving collaboration and co-operation with the various Local Authority Arts Offices, art organisations, educational institutions and school communities.</p><p>C - Artists in Residencies in Higher Education Institutions: Significant developments regarding arts in education for initial teacher education have also been taking place.  Higher education institutions, particularly colleges of education, have been extending their offerings of arts in education courses and experience for student teachers.  The provision of a set of 'artists in residency' bursaries by the Arts Council, for such institutions, has been a major boost to this work.</p><p>D - Artists-Schools Guidelines: The Artists-Schools Guidelines were originally published in 2006. A number of changes have occurred in the arts in education landscape in Ireland since the Guidelines were first published.  A significant change arising from the Charter is the launch of a national digital resource for the arts in education at www.artsineducation.ie.  Given this changing landscape, the Arts Council, on behalf of the Implementation Group of the Arts in Education Charter, is currently reviewing the Artists-Schools Guidelines to examine whether and how they should be updated to continue to act as a useful resource.</p><p>E - Nationwide Mapping of Arts Provision, Relevant to Education: Planning is underway to incorporate a mapping of organisations, events, artists and locations at regional and local level throughout the country, which could be drawn upon for arts-in-education purposes.  This will be incorporated in the Arts-In-Education Portal on an incremental basis.  This could be a major resource for schools, and also help to highlight areas of limited or poor provision, with a view to its remediation.</p><p>F - ARIS &ndash; Arts Rich Schools: The Arts in Education Charter charges the Arts Council, in co-operation with the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht and my Department, with the promotion of Arts Rich Schools (ARIS).  According to the Charter &ndash; 'ARIS will incentivise and recognise those schools (primary and post-primary) which in a range of ways make the arts a key part of school life and place the arts centrally within the life of the school community affecting pupils primarily but also teachers, parents, other staff and community.'  A working group is assisting with the development of Ar&iacute;s and the development of a feasible implementation plan for a first phase of Arts over three years (2017-2019).</p><p>G - Research in Arts in Education: The Arts in Education Charter refers to the need for access to research that builds on existing good practice and explores new models of arts and school practice to create a source of knowledge and experience for policy makers and practitioners to draw on.  The Implementation Group has had communications with the Higher Education Authority, higher education institutions and associated bodies on how best a repository of such research can be established as an on-going source of such provision.  Discussions are still underway with the aim that such a National Digital Research Repository for Arts in Education would be established over the next 18 months. </p><p>H - Music Generation: The Music Generation initiative is co-ordinated and managed by Music Generation Ltd. through its National Development Office. Between 2010 and 2015, 11 Music Generation Music Education Partnerships (MEPs) were established as part of Phase 1 of the initiative, with the aim to provide non-mainstream vocal and instrumental music tuition for young people.  In 2015, Music Generation Ltd. announced Phase 2 of the initiative during which up to 9 additional new MEPs will be established over the period from 2016 up to 2020.Initial funding for 50% of Phase 1 of the Music Generation initiative came from philanthropic sources with the remaining 50% funding from MEPs, with the Exchequer taking up 50% funding after 3 years. Phase 2 will similarly funded.</p><p>I - Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme: The Department of Education and Skills also established the new Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme in February 2016, worth &euro;50,000.  The Purpose of the scheme is to provide support by way of a cash grant to established, smaller-scale, non-mainstream music education/community music initiatives with limited or no access to other forms of public funding.</p><p>J - Local Arts Education Partnership (LAEPs): A further objective of the Charter which will make a major contribution to rooting arts in education at local and regional level as normative provision, is the Local Arts Education Partnerships (LAEPs).  The impact of co-operative efforts by the statutory agencies, the local authorities and the Education and Training Boards (ETBs), in conjunction with the regional Teacher Education Centres and other agencies, have potential to re-shape the landscape of arts in education provision in Ireland.</p><p>K - School Policies: The Charter envisages that schools, in their school policies and plans, shall incorporate arts in education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  Schools will be assisted by my Department in this aspect of their school planning and self-evaluation.  Making provision for arts in education practice will also be reflected in the design and equipping of school buildings.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has also established reciprocal partnership with the Arts Council in the promotion of the arts in schools, as set out in the Charter.</p><p>Implementation of the Arts in Education Charter is overseen by an Implementation Group, chaired by Professor John Coolahan.  The group reports bi-annually to me and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The group presented its fourth bi-annual report in April 2015.</p></reply>

In the context of the Charter, a number of artist residencies have been supported at the Colleges of Education in Ireland.  The residencies include:</p><p>- Dance artist Lisa Cahill at Froebel, Department of Primary and Early Childhood Education in NUI Maynooth;</p><p>- Coisc&eacute;im Dance Theatre at St. Patrick's College in Dublin City University;</p><p>- Fidelio Trio at St. Patrick's College in Dublin City University;</p><p>- Branar T&eacute;atar do Ph&aacute;ist&iacute; at Mary Immaculate College in the University of Limerick;</p><p>- Composer Anne Marie O'Farrell at Mary Immaculate College in the University of Limerick;</p><p>- A series of children's literature residencies at the Church of Ireland College of Education, Dublin.</p><p>The intention of the residencies, which are supported by the Arts Council, is to ensure that teachers have the opportunity to engage directly with the arts early in their careers, and to develop the skills and confidence to facilitate arts experiences for their students.  Each residency was supported for a three year period.  Fidelio Trio was the first to start and it came to the end of its third year in 2015.  The other residencies are currently either in their final year, or about to enter their final year.  The Arts Council intend to support a new set of residencies under the auspices of the Arts in Education Charter.</p></reply>

Security of tenure under the Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  A landlord may not terminate a Part 4 tenancy except on clearly defined grounds which are set out in the Table to section 34 of the Act.  Where any rent owed by a tenant is in arrears for a period of 28 days or more, section 37(2) of the Act provides that the tenancy will be deemed to have been terminated by the tenant if the tenant has vacated the dwelling and no notice of termination has been served by the tenant in respect of the tenancy.  Where a tenant considers that their tenancy has been invalidly deemed terminated by a landlord, they may refer a dispute to the Residential Tenancies Board for resolution.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a specific commitment to review the regulatory regime for the rented sector to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the rights, interests and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.  It is intended to publish a strategy for the rental sector this Autumn, which will chart a path for the future of the rental sector.  It will also list the wide ranging actions this Government will take to achieve a mature and stable rented sector which will appropriately balance the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants, protect the rights of vulnerable tenants, reflect our changing patterns of housing demand and support continued recovery for our modern economy.</p>  <p>  National Protocols for the Discharge of Homeless Persons from Acute Care and Mental Health Services have been developed between the HSE and housing authorities to provide standardised procedures to ensure that discharge from acute and mental health services will not result in homelessness.  I understand that these are currently being rolled out nationally by the HSE.</p></reply>

Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector; this accommodation must be within the HAP rent limits, which are based on the size of the household and the rental market in the relevant local authority area.</p>  <p>  While securing accommodation under HAP can be challenging in areas where there is a shortage of supply, the numbers of households securing accommodation nationally under HAP continues to rise, with an average to date in 2016 of in excess of 200 new tenancies being registered each week.  The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are currently based on the rent supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration. My Department works closely with DSP and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the need for additional discretion in areas of high rental demand, additional flexibility above the maximum rent limits that apply for the purposes of HAP has been provided in the administrative areas of Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Galway City Council, Galway City Council, Kildare County Council, Meath County Council and South Dublin County Council, and for the purposes of the Homeless HAP Pilot Scheme in the Dublin Region.  This additional flexibility facilitates a greater number of qualifying households to source suitable accommodation in these local authority areas.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to extending the capacity of local authorities to make such discretionary payments, while providing a framework for the review of both Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) limits taking account of geographic variations in market rents.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that any revised rent limits will be introduced as early as possible, subject to agreement by Government.</p></reply>

There are two schemes operated under the school meals programme.  The first is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The second scheme is the urban school meals scheme which is operated by local authorities and part-financed by my Department.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 1,200 primary schools and 350 post primary schools availing of the school meals local project scheme.  Of the total, 780 schools are part of the Department of Education and Skill&rsquo;s initiative for disadvantaged schools, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools or DEIS, of which over 75% are primary schools (over 590) and the remaining post primary.</p>  <p>  The scheme is available to support disadvantaged school children and the schools that joined the scheme prior to the introduction of DEIS would have done so under the various educational disadvantaged programmes in place at the time.  These schemes included School Completion Programmes, Giving Children an Even Break, Home School Community Liaison Scheme, Designated Disadvantaged, Early Start and Breaking the Cycle.</p>  <p>  Priority for increased funding or new applicants under the scheme is given to schools which are part of DEIS in line with the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  There is a particular focus on the provision of breakfast clubs in DEIS schools which provide very positive outcomes for vulnerable children in terms of their school attendance, punctuality and energy levels.  Statistics are not maintained on the number schools that previously applied for the school meals scheme and the outcome of the application.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are some 300 primary schools participating in the urban school meals scheme.  Some of these schools may also be receiving funding under the school meals local projects scheme, for example, a breakfast club under one scheme and an afternoon snack under the other.  The decision on eligibility of schools for the urban scheme rests with the local authorities subject to this Department&rsquo;s approval.  A breakdown of the number of these schools in DEIS is not available.</p></reply>

There is no direct contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department.  Recent figures show that direct payments to nominated payees are made in approximately 12,300 cases (22% of cases).  In these cases the rent supplement recipient must continue to make arrangements to pay their minimum contribution required under the scheme directly to their landlord.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP).  The efficiency of the rent supplement scheme would be significantly affected if all payments were to be made directly to landlords, for the provision of a short term support.  Under HAP the local authority pays the full rent directly to the landlord with the HAP recipient required to make a differential rent contribution to the local authority.  HAP is currently operational in 19 local authority areas with payments being made in respect of over 10,370 tenancies.</p>  <p>  It remains open to the landlord to bring to the attention of this Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that overpayments are prevented, and if they occur, they are regarded as a debt to the Exchequer and every effort is made to recover the amount over paid.  If the Deputy has details of a particular case where they suspect misuse of rent supplement, the details should be provided to my Department for review.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.976 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million.  These savings meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 418,000 customers. </p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew, arising from the increased number of pension recipients.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Significant exchequer resources have been invested in the provision and maintenance of these programmes.  The basic allowance paid to participants was increased in Budget 2016.</p>  <p>  JobBridge was introduced in 2011 as an urgent response to the unemployment crisis.  The main aim was to provide an opportunity for jobseekers to secure some work experience, while at the same time supporting employers in taking the first step in recruitment at a time when access to finance was very limited and business risk was very high.  To date, it has helped over 19,000 mainly small employers to provide opportunities to nearly 48,000 jobseekers.  An independent evaluation found that about 61% of JobBridge participants progressed into paid employment within a short period of finishing.</p>  <p>  JobBridge participants receive an allowance equivalent to their underlying their jobseeker payment and an additional top-up of &euro;52 per week.</p>  <p>  Economic and labour market conditions have improved significantly since JobBridge was introduced and a second comprehensive evaluation of the JobBridge is currently underway.  I expect the results to be published in September 2016.  I have already announced that I plan to replace the scheme at that time and have asked the Labour Market Council to assist me in the design of its replacement.  The rate of payment will be one of the issues that I will look at.</p>  <p>  Both T&uacute;s and Community Employment (CE) focus on those who are long-term unemployed, and aim to improve the employability and work readiness of participants by providing them with the opportunities to put skills into practice and learn new ones thus enabling progression to work, further education or skill development opportunities. </p>  <p>  Participants in Community Employment and T&uacute;s schemes work an average of 19.5 hours per week and receive a weekly payment which is equivalent to the social welfare payment appropriate to their family size, plus a top up of &euro;22.50, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;210.50 per week.  The top up payment was increased from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 last year.  Any further changes to the scheme to increase the rate of payment would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and offers a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to other social welfare payments.  There are currently over 56,000 families with more than 122,000 children in receipt of FIS.  Expenditure on FIS is estimated to be of the order of &euro;410 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS average weekly family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.  The income thresholds reflect a number of objectives: to maintain the incentive to take up employment; to reduce the risk of household poverty; and to provide a more consistent level of support per child to poor households.</p>  <p>  Between 2010 and 2015 FIS income thresholds remained unchanged.  In Budget 2016 they were raised by &euro;5 for families with one child and &euro;10 for families with two or more children, at a cost of &euro;18 million in a full year.  The average weekly payment made to families is currently estimated at &euro;135 per week.  Since 2010 the number of families in receipt of FIS has doubled.  </p>  <p>  Based on the most recent FIS recipient numbers from early June 2016, the cost of further increasing the weekly FIS income thresholds by &euro;5 per child per week is estimated to be in the region of &euro;19.2 million.  The cost of increasing the thresholds by &euro;10 per child per week is estimated to be in the region of &euro;38.5 million.</p>  <p>  My Department has no way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the potential in-flow from raising the income thresholds as proposed by the Deputy.

Information held by another Government Department or a public body which is required for the purposes of the Act for the control of schemes may be transferred to the Department.</p><p>In 2012, the Revenue Commissioners provided information on persons who had paid high levels of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) in previous years.  High value DIRT payments indicate that significant amounts of capital have been invested.  This data was cross-referenced with persons in receipt of means-tested social welfare payments.  Broader investigations were initiated following completion of a pilot project undertaken by the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigations Unit in 2012.  These investigations and related processes, such as the recovery of overpaid social welfare payments, are ongoing.  Given the complexity of individual investigations, it is not possible to give a definitive timeline as to when outcomes will be finalised.</p><p>The Department does not record the value of capital held in respect of individual bank accounts.  The dates of false declarations made in individual cases range from the dates of application to schemes and subsequent declarations made over the life cycle of scheme payments.</p><p>To the end of 2015, some &euro;23.1 million has been recovered from persons who had failed to advise the Department of their investments.  Details of the amount recovered in 2013 and 2014 are provided in the following table:</p><p><b>TABLE:  Amounts Recovered on DIRT related Investigations 2013 to 2015</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount Recovered</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;10.3m</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;8.4m</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;4.4m</td></tr></table></p><p>The Department can indicate that the highest value repayment in 2015 amounted to some &euro;144,000 with an average of the highest value recoveries (those over &euro;90,000) amounting to some &euro;118,300.  The Department does not maintain records of the value of the investment held by each individual customer and, therefore, it is not possible to provide aggregate values for the sums invested, not all of which had been concealed from the Department.</p></reply>

The MA provides a medical opinion to a Deciding Officer in the Department&rsquo;s relevant scheme area to aid them making their overall final decision, which may also involve non-medical criteria (e.g. means and residency for Disability Allowance and numbers of PRSI contributions for Invalidity Pension).  If a customer is found to be not eligible on their claim, they are entitled to request a review/appeal while submitting new medical evidence for assessment.  Statistics are provided for the following schemes as requested:</p><p>- Disability Allowance,</p><p>- Illness Benefit,</p><p>- Invalidity Pension,</p><p>- Occupational Injury benefit and</p><p>- Partial Capacity Benefit.</p><p>No statistics are available for Blind Pension but it is normal practice for medical opinions to be returned to the scheme area within 2/3 days.

This is due to Medical Assessors&rsquo; availability and an increase in the overall number of applications.  An MA recruitment campaign has just ended and it is expected to employ additional MAs in the near future and a further recruitment campaign will be held in the Autumn.  In the meantime MA resources have been prioritised on customers on whose applications a payment may be dependant.  Accordingly a marked improvement in waiting times should be noticeable in the coming months.</p></reply>

In advance of the launch of the report of the Housing and Homelessness Committee, my Department has been examining the rent limits in the context of the Government commitment to provide for an increase and it is my intention that revised rent limits will be brought to Government for agreement within the coming weeks.</p><p>The strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support scheme.  Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to local authorities.  HAP is currently operational in 19 local authority areas, including Kildare, with payments being made in respect of over 10,350 tenancies of which over 350 are in place in Kildare.  Where HAP is in operation this Department will continue to provide rental support, under the rent supplement scheme, to those with a short term need, generally because of a temporary loss of employment.</p><p>At this time of constrained supply, the Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents exceed limits.<b></b>This ensures that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required.  Currently, over 8,600 households in receipt of rent supplement are supported through this approach with some 430 households assisted in Kildare.</p><p>The Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute.  Following engagement with the relevant agencies this protocol was recently extended to the commuter counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, and also to Galway City. </p><p>Any person experiencing increased rents or facing the threat of the loss of their tenancy under rent supplement are urged to contact the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service or the Threshold Tenancy Protection service without delay. </p></reply>

While there is a problem with the care of unaccompanied minors in parts of Greece, the Greek authorities are working with the UN High Commission for Refugees and UNICEF to provide appropriate facilities for unaccompanied minors. Since the EU-Turkey deal of March this year, new arrivals on the islands, including unaccompanied minors, are taken to the hotspots where their claims can be assessed.  If they are found to be admissible under the terms of the EU-Turkey deal, they can be taken to centres on the mainland.  Up to 500 migrants have already been deemed admissible and moved to the mainland.   The Greek Government, working with the European Asylum Support Office, the UN High Commission for Refugees and other agencies, is currently conducting a mass pre-registration programme in the mainland refugee camps.  They hope to pre-register all migrants in Greece by the end of July.  Once the pre-registration has taken place, the government will know where it stands in relation to the profile of all migrants (age, family status, nationality, and special needs) and will be able to devise appropriate responses, including and especially relating to the care and protection of unaccompanied minors.</p></reply>

Through Irish Aid, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides humanitarian assistance for refugees forced to live in camps and those living in host communities, and supports their livelihoods through a range of channels.  The United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has long been one of Ireland's key multilateral partners.  I was very pleased that this year we were in a position to increase our core funding to UNHCR to &euro;7 million, from &euro;5.8 million in 2015.  This reflects Ireland<font color="#004080">&rsquo;</font>s strong emphasis on the vital work of the agency, particularly in the context of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis. </p><p>In addition to the provision of financial support, we engage in strategic policy dialogue with UNHCR through our membership of its governing body, the Executive Committee, and through high level bilateral meetings.  This enables us to monitor the work of UNHCR, focussing on strengthening the Results-Based Management approach to its operations, and in particular the systematic use of standards and indicators to measure and ensure the well-being of refugees under its protection.</p><p>We also provide targeted assistance to refugees living in camps through our partners on the ground, providing assistance to a number of refugee camps in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.  For example, in addition to our core funding, we have provided &euro;2 million to UNHCR since 2015 to implement its South Sudan regional response plan.  We have also provided over &euro;2 million since 2014 to our NGO partners for lifesaving emergency services to South Sudanese refugees in the Gambella camps in Ethiopia and the Adjumani camps in northern Uganda.  In the Middle East, last year we provided &euro;500,000 to UNICEF in Jordan for water and sanitation facilities in Azraq refugee camp and a further &euro;800,000 to UNHCR specifically for their work with Syrian refugees in the country.</p><p>In addition, the Department, through its Rapid Response Initiative, has airlifted humanitarian relief supplies such as blankets and tents to refugee camps hosting South Sudanese, Syrian and Nigerian refugees fleeing violence and conflict.</p><p>Ireland is also a longstanding supporter of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)  in delivering humanitarian and development assistance to some 5 million Palestine refugees.  During my visit to the Middle East last week, I announced funding of &euro;4.5 million for UNRWA for its work in delivering core services, especially education and health.  As a member of UNRWA&rsquo;s Advisory Commission, we work to ensure full support for the critical work of the Agency.  </p><p>While the need exists, I am determined that we will continue our work through our UN and NGO partners in refugee camps and in communities hosting large refugee populations to improve living conditions and to ensure that basic needs are met.  All these partners are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure the effectiveness of this work. </p></reply>

Ireland, along with its EU partners, supports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of those States.  Ireland has repeatedly raised the human rights situation in Syria and Iraq at the UN and the EU.  Ireland has called for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, given the multiple and credible reports of crimes requiring international action and the failure to prevent and reported accountability of the Syrian authorities for the overwhelming majority of these crimes.  Ireland has also repeatedly made clear its strong support for the UN-led negotiations to agree a political solution to the Syrian crisis, based on the 2012 Geneva Communique principles.  Ireland has urged international stakeholders, including the Assad regime&rsquo;s backers, to give their full backing to the UN process.   The Government is also strongly supportive of the 2014 political reform and national reconciliation programme announced by PM Abadi of Iraq.  Integration of all religious and ethnic groups in Iraq is a vital response to supporting Iraq&rsquo;s unity, integrity and sovereignty.  This is a critical political response to parallel security efforts to confront Daesh and to end the threat of jihadist terrorism and the safe haven posed by Daesh control of parts of the territory of Syria and Iraq. </p>  <p>  The domestic situation in Turkey remains a matter of concern, both for Ireland and our European partners.  I would like to reiterate the serious concern I have expressed several times already in this House at the escalation of violence since the breakdown of the ceasefire between the Turkish Government and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) last summer.  This breakdown has been all the more regrettable given that there were positive signs in the peace process as recently as early 2015. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the peace talks between the Turkish Government and the PKK and, through the work of the Conflict Resolution Unit of my Department, financial assistance has been provided to an international NGO which has facilitated study visits to Ireland by Turkish and Kurdish MPs, journalists, and advisers working for peace.  The current situation demonstrates clearly the critical importance for all sides to cease hostilities and return to dialogue and I take this opportunity to urge again all sides to do so.  The most recent Progress Report on Turkey, published by the European Commission in November 2015, emphasised the importance of this too. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has participated in discussions at the European Council on the issue of human rights in Syria, Iraq and Turkey.  Officials in my Department, both at headquarters in Dublin and in our Embassies in Cairo, Riyadh and Ankara, will continue to follow these developments very closely.</p></reply>

This amelioration of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), which subsequently became law under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, provides for changes to occur in three phases, on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2016, increases in the exemption thresholds for PSPR application were activated.  These exemption threshold increases fully removed PSPR from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR received a boost of &euro;400 per year.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, will fully remove PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR by &euro;500 per year. </p>  <p>  On 1 January 2018, the third phase of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.</p>  <p>  These phased PSPR changes across the public service will cost an estimated &euro;90 million on an annual basis and, when fully implemented, will ensure that only the top 20% higher value public service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR.  I have no plans to propose alterations to the dates on which these phased changes to the PSPR are to occur, as provided for under FEMPI 2015.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I am required to undertake an annual review of the necessity of the FEMPI legislation and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That report is currently being prepared and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas later this month.</p></reply>

However, such a difference does exist in respect of pensions awarded to persons retiring before and after the end of February 2012.</p><p>Pensions awarded in respect of retirements up to end-February 2012 benefit from the &quot;grace period&quot; instituted under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  This means that such pensions are based on higher final salaries, that is to say salaries which do not reflect the pay cuts of 1 January 2010 under that Act.</p><p>By contrast, pensions awarded to post-February 2012 retirees do not benefit from that &quot;grace period&quot;, being based on lower final salaries which factor in the 2010 pay cuts. This means such pensions are lower, on a like-for-like basis, than earlier awarded pensions and on that account are subject to a lighter, less impactful, PSPR regime, featuring higher exemption thresholds and lower percentage reduction rates. In fact the majority of post-February 2012 pensions have never been affected by the PSPR, due to the fact that an exemption threshold of &euro;32,500 has applied since 1 July 2013.</p><p>My answer to PQ 17210/16 on 21 June 2016 gives a breakdown of the PSPR effects on a sample of public service pensions in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Table A of that breakdown covers pensions awarded up to the end of February 2012, while Table B covers pensions awarded from 1 March 2012.  </p><p>The 2015 figures in those tables reflect the PSPR rates position legislated with effect from 1 July 2013 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, while the 2016, 2017 and 2018 figures in the tables reflect the significant part-restoration of the PSPR cuts now underway under the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015. Earlier (pre-July 2013) PSPR rates are set out in my Department's Circular 18/2015: Changes to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).</p><p>Based on available data, reasonable assumptions about future retirements and mortality rates, and the programmed restoration steps under FEMPI 2015, the estimated savings in public service pension costs delivered by PSPR over the years 2011 to 2018 are as follows; &euro;100 million in 2011, &euro;100 million in 2012, &euro;120 million in 2013, &euro;140 million in 2014, &euro;135 million in 2015, &euro;105 million in 2016, &euro;75 million in 2017 and &euro;45 million in 2018.  </p><p>These figures indicate that, by comparison with the savings attributable to PSPR in 2015, the estimated full-year cost of abolishing PSPR is &euro;135 million.</p></reply>

The NHQRS was established to provide a broad overall picture of the quality of our health services.  It is intended to demonstrate to individual hospitals and other health service providers the importance of examining their own data in order to improve the services they provide. It must however, be understood that the performance and quality of a service cannot be measured by one indicator alone.  This is why the NHQRS presents an  analysis of a range of indicators that reflect different parts of the services and allows progress and priorities in the health system to be identified.  The NHQRS will help to inform many improvements in service outcomes for patients. </p>  <p>  The information will inform my priorities as Minister for Health, it will provide intelligence and information for the 10 Year Plan for Health and I hope the Health Committee will avail of the opportunity to be briefed on this.  It will also inform my Department's Statement of Strategy. </p>  <p>  The Second annual NHQRS Report was published last Thursday 16th June.  It is very encouraging to see  improvements in many areas, for example in the areas of immunisation, uptake of cancer screening and survival rates for patients with breast and colorectal cancer  which are improving at a rate faster than most other European countries in the OECD.  One example of how this information will be used is to ensure that the cancer indicators feed into the new Cancer Strategy currently being drawn up by my Department.    Similarly, the figures for stroke patients, indicate  over 80% are admitted to hospitals with a designated stroke unit which, again, is to the forefront of other OECD countries. </p>  <p>  I recognise that there are areas identified where further room for improvement exists. In particular, considerable variation can be seen between counties in rates of hospitalisation for common chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes and heart failure. Identifying this variation is a first step to addressing the reasons why this variation exists and to improving it.  For example, the information on COPD is already informing requirements in Primary Care and the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) COPD Guideline being developed by the HSE Clinical Programme for the management of this disease.</p>  <p>  It is international standard best practice not to report rates for small numbers such as hospitals with less than 100 cases as outlined in the NHQRS Report.  The number of cases for each hospital are, however, reported in the NHQRS.</p></reply>

It provides a significant range of hospital services to patients in the region, including extended day surgery, certain acute medicine services and local injuries services.  It also provides a wide array of diagnostic services (including endoscopy, laboratory medicine, point of care testing and radiology), as well as specialist rehabilitation medicine and palliative care. The Hospital has 86 in-patient beds, which includes an acute mental health unit. </p>  <p>  Roscommon University Hospital plays an essential role as part of the Saolta Healthcare Group of hospitals and will continue to do so in the future.  We know that the future growth in healthcare will be in the areas of chronic disease management and day surgery, diagnostics and rehabilitation.  The activity levels of Model 2 hospitals, such as Roscommon University Hospital, will continue to increase over the coming years as these hospitals specialise in providing these services to meet the needs of their local populations.  </p>  <p>A new Endoscopy Unit at the Hospital opened on a phased basis on 1 June, 2016. When fully operational, all endoscopy procedures will be carried in the new Unit, freeing up theatre capacity for more day surgery cases to be carried out in Roscommon. The official opening of the unit will take place later this year.</p>  <p>  The Specialist Rehabilitation Unit planned for Roscommon University Hospital was one of the many projects in the HSE multi-annual Capital Plan 2015-2019 and internal HSE approval was granted to progress the development of the Rehabilitation Unit in 2015.  The spatial plan for Roscommon Hospital was approved in the first quarter of 2016 and the project team, comprising hospital/clinical and Estates personnel, is currently being assembled.  </p>  <p>  Following this work by the project team, the project will move to the next stage. The HSE has advised the Department of Health that funding for the project would be considered in the 2017-2021 multi-annual period. It is my expectation that every effort will be made to fund this project as early as possible in that time period.</p></reply>

It is authorised as a substitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment.  It is currently being provided to a cohort of patients involved in the piloting and feasibility study for Suboxone. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Department of Health, the HSE set up an implementation group to introduce, supervise, monitor and review the wider availability and cost of buprenorphine/naloxone products for opioid substitution therapy.  In January 2016 the Director General of the HSE submitted the report of this Opioid Substitution Implementation Group to my predecessor, the Minister of State with special responsibility for drugs strategy.  No decision on the report was taken at that time. The report recommends the phased, increased access to buprenorphine/naloxone for a cohort of patients in specific circumstances, subject to required legislation being enacted and resourcing.  It was noted in the report that additional funding would be required and that these additional resources for 2016 had not been allocated.  </p>  <p>  The mechanisms proposed in this report will require legislative changes to be made.  If the provision of Suboxone is to be given the same statutory basis as methadone, in order to ensure its safe, appropriate and cost-effective use, an amendment to the Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations 1998 will be necessary. </p>  <p>  The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 was enacted as emergency legislation in March 2015 following a Court of Appeal decision on a constitutional challenge to section 2(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  The 2015 Act reconfirmed the existing Ministerial regulations and orders made under the 1977 Act, including the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 and the 1998 Methadone Regulations.  As a result, these Regulations may only now be amended by primary legislation. </p>  <p>  As you know, on Tuesday the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2016 was published.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to protect public health by bringing certain substances which are open to misuse and known to be traded on the illicit market under the scope of the Misuse of Drugs legislation, as well as aiding the law enforcement functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service.  The Bill provides for a small number of other amendments of a technical nature including the &lsquo;unlocking&rsquo; of the previously confirmed Regulations and Ministerial Orders.</p>  <p>  It is hoped that this Bill can be enacted before the summer recess.  Controlling the substances in the Bill is part one of a two-step process.  Regulations are also required to allow legitimate users (patients with a prescription, health professionals) to possess the newly controlled substances.  Work is underway on drafting these regulations as a matter of priority.  Any regulations made in relation to buprenorphine/naloxone will be drafted subsequent to this legislative agenda and will then be subject to the 3-month EU notification under the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 2015/1535/EU.</p></reply>

Methadone was implicated in 93 poisoning deaths in 2013, compared with 86 in 2012.  However, the majority of poisoning deaths  where methadone was implicated, involved other drugs.  There is clear evidence to indicate that having access to drug treatment is one of the major factors in reducing drug-related deaths.  </p>  <p>  Suboxone is a medicinal product comprising the drugs buprenorphine and naloxone.  It is authorised as a substitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment.  It is currently being provided to a cohort of patients involved in the piloting and feasibility study for Suboxone. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Department of Health, the HSE set up an implementation group to determine the conditions to govern the wider availability of buprenorphine/naloxone products for opioid substitution therapy.  In January 2016,  the HSE submitted its report to the Department.  The report recommends the phased increased access to buprenorphine/naloxone for a cohort of patients in specific circumstances, including the resources required, subject to the required legislation being enacted to provide buprenorphine/naloxone on the same statutory basis as methadone.  If the provision of Suboxone is to be made on this basis, any regulations made in relation to Suboxone will need to be drafted subsequent to the legislative agenda associated with the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2016.</p>  <p>  Methadone maintenance treatment is a critical stabilising treatment, which is the most appropriate substitution treatment for the majority of patients.  Naloxone is an opioid antagonist which is used to reverse the effects of overdose of opioids such as heroin, morphine and methadone and has been proven to be an effective way of reducing the number of opioid overdose deaths.  In May 2015, the HSE undertook a demonstration project to assess and evaluate the suitability and impact of using a pre-filled Naloxone injection which is designed for non-medical administration in Ireland.  The project involved 600 opiate users receiving take-home naloxone on prescription.  It also included those recently released from custody who have been identified as at high risk of opioid overdose.  These drug users and those close to them have been trained on how to administer naloxone and to recognise the signs of an overdose.  The HSE has advised that an evaluation of the demonstration project has been completed and a national implementation plan is currently being developed.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange health services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

The overriding principle now is one of affordability and compliance with allocated pay budgets which managers must forecast and monitor over the course of each year with the completion of a Pay and Numbers Strategy.</p>  <p>  Recent measures taken in relation to service areas in the HSE remaining within budget have been portrayed, incorrectly, as a recruitment freeze.  The HSE is currently working with the Department of Health on the finalisation of its 2016 Pay and Numbers Strategy.  This has involved the development of detailed workforce plans at hospital and community service level. </p>  <p>  These measures do not impact on a hospital&rsquo;s ability to recruit where funding exists to facilitate that recruitment; for example in the case of funded replacement posts or where additional funding has been allocated for new positions under the HSE service plan.  Recruitment can also take place in areas of critical care and emergency services.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has continuously increased staffing levels since the beginning of 2015.  By the end of April this year, overall health service employee numbers had increased by over 6,000 whole time equivalents since the start of last year, with an extra 1,600 WTEs in the first four months of 2016 alone.  The vast majority of these employees are in front line positions.  Numbers in the Medical and Dental category increased by almost 600 WTEs or 6.5% since the start of 2015 while nursing figures rose by over 1,700 or 5% during the same timeframe.</p>  <p>  It is this government&rsquo;s intention to continue to grow the health budget as the economy improves and to obtain further resources to deliver the level of service that we all want to provide to our patients.</p></reply>

The EDTF Implementation Group has met on a regular basis during 2015 and into 2016; most recently on the 30th May 2016.  The Group has been overseeing initiatives to address ED overcrowding and ED performance.  </p>  <p>  Over the 2015/2016 winter period, the ED Taskforce Implementation Group played a key role in monitoring ED performance and ensuring a coordinated approach across Primary, Acute and Social Care to addressing ED wait times.  This concerted and coordinated effort has had an impact; despite a sustained increase in ED attendances (5.6%), trolley performance has been favourable to date this year in comparison with the same period last year.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the wide range of experience and perspectives represented on the Taskforce, the resulting EDTF Action Plan, published in April 2015, sets out 87 recommendations to optimise existing hospital and community capacity, develop internal capability and process improvement and improve leadership, governance, planning and oversight.  </p>  <p>  The 87 Recommendations have been re-categorised in terms of priority and their current status.  The Action Plan forms the basis by which the Implementation Group, in a structured way, tracks progress on actions that will have real and measurable benefits in improving ED performance and patient experience.</p>  <p>  The work of the EDTF Implementation group has been supplemented by the Special Delivery Unit, or SDU, which was established in 2011, also to tackle ED overcrowding.  Its recent focus has been on unscheduled care, in particular with a focus on adherence to the &lsquo;National Escalation Directive&rsquo; (designed to streamline hospital responses to surges in demand for unscheduled care) and the implementation of the EDTF recommendations. </p>  <p>  Review Phase site visits to all acute hospitals are almost complete; findings will inform the EDTF and a 2016-18 Winter Initiative to reduce overcrowding in EDs.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements, compensation is payable for cattle removed as reactors. This compensation is based on the market value of the animal i.e. the price that might reasonably have been obtained for it, from a purchaser on the open market if the animal had not been affected by TB.  Where a breakdown occurs, the reactor is valued by an independent Valuer and my Department pays the difference between this valuation and the salvage value which the farmer receives from the slaughter plant. In order to ensure that reactors are valued uniformly across the country and on the basis of current market prices, my Department has issued assessment guidelines for all categories of stock to all valuers. In addition, my Department issues up-to-date summary prices to valuers on a weekly basis. Summary prices for non-breeding beef stock are based on prices collected by Department officials at 7 representative marts while summary prices for breeding stock, both pedigree and non-pedigree, are based on prices collected by Department officials at premier, dispersal, reduction and regional sales throughout the country.</p>  <p>  In view of the foregoing, I am satisfied that, taking account of the payment from my Department and the price received by the herdowner from the slaughter plant, a farmer, at any given time, receives a level of compensation which adequately reflects the market valuation of reactors, including suckler cows, as if they were not affected by bovine TB.</p></reply>

The Programme&rsquo;s content and design was formulated in light of previous experience and performance and reflects the outcome of extensive stakeholder consultation and does not include support for anaerobic digesters or bio-energy production on farms.  Both anaerobic digestion and bio-energy production were previously funded under the RDP and nationally but uptake was unsatisfactory and interest in the schemes generally poor.  Under the Rural Development Programme 2000 -2006 a Pilot Waste Processing Facilities Scheme made funding available for the installation of anaerobic digesters on 10 Irish farms.  Of the 10 applicants who were approved under the scheme, two applications were finalised and drew down the grant available and a further two cases have been given an extension to the end of 2016 to complete the work. </p>  <p>  The Bio-Energy Scheme commenced in 2007 on a nationally funded pilot basis and continued to be nationally funded until 2010.  The scheme was co-funded under the RDP 2007-2013 for the years from 2011 to 2014.  The Bioenergy Scheme 2015 provided once off capital grants up to 40% subject to a maximum of &euro;1,040 per hectare to facilitate the establishment of willow for use in renewable energy production.  Previous schemes had covered both willow and miscanthus.  Grant aid was payable in respect of ground preparation, seed purchase and planting costs.  Up take on the Scheme was poor and attracted only four applications.  The 2015 Scheme was nationally funded.  The continuation of the scheme of support for the growing of bio-energy crops is currently under review. </p>  <p>  On the broader issue of support for renewable energy, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources leads in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy policy and oversees the Renewable Electricity Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  These Schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid.  The schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period.  The technologies supported include onshore wind energy, hydroelectricity, landfill gas, waste-to-energy and biomass technologies, including anaerobic digestion.  Electricity and heat produced from anaerobic digestion (AD) are supported under the REFIT 3 scheme. </p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is currently examining the design and cost of introducing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) to encourage the development of Ireland&rsquo;s abundant and indigenous renewable energy resources.

When finalised shortly there will be some 6,000 successful applicants under the 2015 National Reserve.  As all of the National Reserve funding has been utilised, there is no funding available to cover the operation of a 2016 National Reserve.  For 2016 the only source of funding available to the National Reserve will be from &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; on the sale of entitlements without land and indications are that the level of funds that will arise from &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; during the 2016 scheme year will be minimal.  The Regulations also provide that Member States may apply a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements in order to provide funding for the National Reserve. </p>  <p>  The operation of a National Reserve for 2016 would require the re-opening of the 2016 Basic Payment Scheme for applications as, under EU Regulation, applicants to the National Reserve must also submit a valid Basic Payment Scheme application for the year in which they submit the National Reserve application.  As the closing date for Basic Payment Scheme applications has now passed, farmers have finalised arrangements regarding the declaration of land for the 2016 scheme year which would have implications for potential National Reserve applicants.  The re-opening of Basic Payment Scheme applications at this stage would likely delay the processing of such applications for 2016, with the consequent potential for delay in payments.  Furthermore at this stage many young farmers may have entered arrangements to lease in entitlements in 2016 in order to avail of the Greening payment and Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme payment.</p>  <p>  From 2017 onwards the National Reserve will be replenished from unused entitlements, as EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that entitlements that are unused for 2 consecutive years are surrendered to the National Reserve.  While I am very supportive of the provision of a National Reserve, decisions in relation to the Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding arising from unused entitlements and &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; has been established.</p></reply>

The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for State intervention and includes Kinnitty in the townland of The Walk, the townland of Cadamstown and Ballyboy in the townland of Garrycastle, County Offaly.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Offaly. Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to  <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</i></p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to qualifying bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

This commitment builds on the Energy White Paper published in December 2015 and recognises that solar <font color="#0D0D0D">photo voltaic (PV) </font>also has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future.</p><p>It is widely recognised that solar photo voltaic (PV) technology has become more cost competitive for electricity generation over the last few years, not only compared with other renewables but also compared with conventional forms of generation.  With these significant changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar PV in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, to contribute to our renewable energy targets and to support economic growth and jobs.  It is also recognised however, that while the cost competitiveness of solar PV has improved, it would still require a subsidy in order to be developed on a commercial basis.</p><p>Work is now on-going to examine the design and cost of introducing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) to encourage the development of Ireland&rsquo;s abundant and indigenous renewable energy resources.  This scheme will examine the economic viability of supporting a range of new renewable energy technologies in Ireland - including solar - and will help to further reduce energy-related emissions.  While the scheme is not purposely designed to meet our 2020 obligations it is likely to make some contribution to those targets.</p><p>The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity are the REFIT (Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff) schemes.  While the REFIT schemes are now closed to new applications, the schemes cover a range of technologies, including wind energy, biomass technologies and landfill gas.  The REFIT schemes have proven very successful at incentivising the increase in the use of renewable energy in Ireland.  A report published by the Council for European Energy Regulators found Ireland to have one of the lowest levels of monetary support per unit of gross electricity produced and maintaining this value for money for end consumers will be an important element of any new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme.</p><p>While the inherent benefits of an increased use of renewable energy in Ireland are apparent in terms of displacement of fossil fuels, consequent emissions reductions, increased security of supply and reducing the potential impact of fossil fuel price volatility, it is equally important to understand the potential cost of this transition.</p><p>Quantifying this cost is a complex task due to the number of influencing components.  For example, while renewable electricity generation introduces savings by reducing the need to burn fossil fuels, this is offset to a certain extent by increased costs of system operation, the need for additional network investment and the capital and operational costs of the renewable generators.  In the past a number of studies have been completed by various parties in the energy sector focusing on particular aspects of this issue.  However, a broad based analysis is being finalised by my Department, the SEAI, Eirgrid and the CER, which looks at the range of components contributing to the projected costs and the financial impact on the electricity customer.  The report will be published this year once the work has been completed.</p></reply>

The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure together with targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.  The Capital Plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects.  Allowing for the commitments relating to the PPP projects, the balance available for new projects within the available capital envelope was limited.  Given the funding constraints a project of the scale of the M20 would have absorbed a substantial proportion of the budget for new projects.  In those circumstances, as I understand it, the decision made by my predecessor was to provide for a mix of smaller scale projects across the country to address particular constraints, including bottlenecks and port connectivity.  As part of the Programme for Partnership Government there is an increased emphasis on the need for spending on public services but the Government still has to operate within the EU fiscal rules and this does constrain options.  There will be a Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan and this will provide an opportunity to assess progress and consider what scope there is for increased levels of investment depending on economic growth.  As regards the N20, I do expect that the position regarding the project will be considered as part of the Mid -Term Review.</p></reply>

Whilst the outcome of the review resulted in the modification/abolition of some allowances across the public sector, the only allowances paid to civil servants in my Department that were abolished were the Delegates'/Chairperson&rsquo;s allowances paid to Departmental staff who travel outside of Ireland and the UK to represent Ireland at meetings of the EU or other international organisations or who act as Chairpersons of EU Committees. Given that the payment of Delegates/Chairpersons Allowances was entirely related to instances when staff were required to carry out particular Representational/Chairperson&rsquo;s roles when travelling outside of Ireland, it would not be possible to estimate the cost of re-introducing these allowances. However, I can inform the Deputy that the cost of these Allowances for the last year they were in operation, in 2012, amounted to &euro;73,719.54.</p>  <p>  As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s Question concerning the cost of paying public sector workers recruited in my Department post-2011 at the pre-2011 rate, I would advise the Deputy that in late 2010 the Government approved the reduction by 10% of the salary scale for new entrants to traditional recruitment grades in the public service with effect from 1st January 2011. Insofar as my Department is concerned, the estimated cost of restoring post 1st January 2011 entrants to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, including the cost of employers PRSI, across all of the recruitment grades in question, is estimated at &euro;86,000 approximately.  The total pay bill for my Department is &euro;49 million approximately.</p>  <p>  This costing specifically relates to the 10% reduction in entry grades to the public service as provided for in the aforementioned Government decision and does not take account of any pay reductions imposed as a result of the Haddington Road Agreement.</p></reply>

It does not apply to non-public sectors. </p>  <p>  It is an administrative requirement based on a Government Decision, whereby all Government Departments, State Agencies and the wider Public Service are obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. The 15 day prompt payment requirement does not affect the statutory requirement for late payment interest which only comes into effect 30 days after receipt of a valid invoice.</p>  <p>  This administrative requirement was first introduced by Government on a voluntary basis in 2009 in respect of Central Government Departments only.  In order to monitor the performance of each Government Department in meeting the 15 day deadline, my Department compiles and publishes composites reports on a quarterly basis.  </p>  <p>  In 2011, as part of the commitments in the EU/IMF Programme for Ireland, the 15 day prompt payment requirement was extended beyond central Government Departments and rolled out to the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (excluding Commercial Semi-State bodies).</p>  <p>  As part of this extended arrangement, parent Departments are required to publish, on their respective websites, quarterly composite reports covering those bodies under their aegis. The individual bodies covered by this arrangement are also required to publish their own quarterly reports on their websites.</p>  <p>  These reporting arrangements ensure that all Ministers can monitor the performance of their respective Departments, and those bodies under their aegis, and address any issues with non-compliance to the 15 day prompt payment requirement. </p>  <p>  In respect of the non-public sectors, Government has introduced a number of prompt payment initiatives, including:</p>  <p>  - The European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2012 which came into effect on 16 March 2013.  Under these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to late payment interest, plus compensation costs, on the amount outstanding.</p>  <p>  - Launch of the Prompt Payment Code (PPC) portal in March of 2015.  The PPC, which is hosted through an online portal &ndash; www.promptpayment.ie &ndash; is a new initiative aimed encouraging and promoting best practice between businesses and their suppliers, improving cash flow between businesses and driving a change in payment culture. </p>  <p>  - Introduction in late 2015 of the Payments Forum. The role of the Forum is to support the delivery of the Prompt Payment Code (PPC) and also examine further initiatives to sustain a responsible payment culture in Ireland.</p>  <p>  These initiatives, in respect of both the public and non-public sectors, demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s continuing drive and commitment to encourage a prompt payment culture in Ireland.</p></reply>
