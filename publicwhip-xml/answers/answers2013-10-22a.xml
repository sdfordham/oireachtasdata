The effect of the Preservation Order is that any works affecting the site require my consent, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.  </p><p>  On 16 July last I made a determination in relation to a consent application and related Environmental Impact Statement submitted by the owners in relation to proposed works on the monument site.  I believe that, having carefully considered all the relevant factors, my decision on the consent application is the best way to ensure that work can take place at the national monument to develop an appropriate commemorative centre to the events of Easter week 1916, whilst also ensuing that the monument site is fully protected for future generations.  My decision provides for the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre, involving the full repair and conservation of the four buildings.  The order which I signed did not approve the demolition of any structures or the removal of any material from the site which date from or before 1916.  Nor did it approve works for the provision of an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument site, or the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16.</p><p>  The national monument is in private ownership and, accordingly, the advancement of proposals that reflect the terms of the consent I have granted is a matter for the owners.  The consent is, however, conditional on a revised project design being submitted to me for approval within 9 months of the decision date that takes full account of the elements of the proposal for which consent has been refused and the conditions attached to the approved works.  A further condition requires substantive works to commence on site within 3 months of the approval of the revised proposals.  In that regard, I met recently with the owners of the national monument who informed me that they were currently examining proposals for the site which would fit within the confines of my decision, particularly with regard to the retention of all pre-1916 features of the national monument.  </p><p>  In terms of the planning requirements which would apply to any further proposal for the site, a planning authority is required under the Planning Acts to notify me as Minister of any application for planning permission where it appears to the authority that the development might affect or be unduly close to a national monument.  The consent processes under the Planning and Development Acts and the National Monuments Acts operate independently of each other.</p></reply>

I continue to work with my colleagues in Government, and with the National Cultural Institutions and other stakeholders, to explore options for comprehensive and authentic commemorations.  I am also taking advice from the Oireachtas Group on Commemorations, which I chair, and the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations, with a view to ensuring that this most important event is imaginatively and respectfully commemorated.  My Department is also working closely with Dublin City Council on these matters.</p><p>  The historic significance of locations and buildings in Dublin and elsewhere will be reflected as much as possible in the commemoration programme, including by way of memorials and commemorative exhibitions or otherwise, where appropriate.  The inclusion in the Budget announcements of capital funding for 1916 Commemoration Projects, including the GPO inner courtyard exhibition and interpretative facility, is a welcome step toward the realisation of plans, which will seek to demonstrate the respect which our State and its citizens hold for the people who laid down their lives for our freedom.</p></reply>

The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated.  Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in one of the relocation sites from the 2014 turf cutting season.</p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 7 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of a small group of 3 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon to Togher, County Roscommon, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that this group of qualifying turf cutters will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites.  Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.</p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure/drainage works required, establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.  In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 70 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department.  Bord na M&oacute;na has also commenced negotiations with landowners in relation to the purchase or long-term lease of sites.</p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs.</p></reply>

The Heritage Council had sought additional funds to enable it to recommence its grants scheme and I am pleased to say that the Estimates for my Department published last week provide for a small increase in the allocation from my Department's vote to the Heritage Council.  This is subject to final confirmation in the Revised Estimates.</p><p>  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports in 2013 and future years having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  However, the additional funding which I have provided should assist the Council in re-establishing its grants scheme.  In 2012 the Heritage Council was subject to a critical review of its operations by my Department.  The report and recommendations of this review were accepted by Government in October 2012.</p><p>  Officials in my Department are currently working on amendments to the Heritage Act 1995 to give effect to the recommendations of this review.  My Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow.</p></reply>

The European Commission oversees the fulfilment of these obligations through a series of biogeographic seminars, which compare the effort of Member States within a biogeographic region.  Such a seminar in 2009 found that certain habitats and species were insufficiently represented in the list of marine candidate SACs proposed for designation by Ireland.  The designation of marine SACs was scheduled for completion for the entire EU last year and the six additional marine candidate SACs that I proposed for designation last December - Blackwater Bank, the West Connacht Coast, Hempton's Turbot Bank, Rockabill to Dalkey Island, Porcupine Bank Canyon and the South East Rockall Bank - constitute Ireland's contribution to that process.  </p><p>  My Department is currently processing some 54 appeals against the proposed designation of these sites.

However, I understand that provision has been made in the recent Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 to allow my Department to act as agents for the Registrar General to provide access to the indexes of births, deaths and marriages online.  I further understand that the Department of Social Protection has been considering the issue of making certain historic civil registration records available to the public through an on-line search facility in conjunction with my Department, and has met with a number of stakeholders with a view to introducing measures to allow this.  It is hoped that these measures will be contained in the forthcoming Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill.  </p><p>  As Minister, I have concentrated on improving access to genealogical records with a view to developing further the already important genealogical tourism product and attracting more visitors to Ireland.  Indeed, for example, the National Archives, an agency under my auspices, has placed a large volume of records online, including the 1901 and 1911 census records which have attracted huge interest. Similarly as part of its contribution to The Gathering, my Department has developed a website - www.Irish Genealogy.ie - as a virtual entry point and a portal for those wishing to search for genealogical records across a number of different websites.  These measures have made a considerable contribution to the enhancement of our genealogical tourism potential.</p></reply>

This included a website portal and joint commercial and marketing strategy. Under the Croke Park and Haddington Road reform programme, we have now gone beyond what was contemplated by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Indeed, savings of the order of 20-25% in the Exchequer allocations to the cultural institutions have been made since 2010.  </p><p>  In tandem the Government had agreed a range of reforms under the Public Service Reform Plan 2011 for a number of the national cultural institutions under the aegis of my Department.  The focus within my Department and the national cultural institutions has been concentrated on the implementation of the Reform Plan and there has been an intensive engagement by all in that process.  I have previously advised the House of the shared service models that are being developed for the national cultural institutions through my Department in relation to corporate support services and, by formal inter-institutional agreement, in relation to operational services.  For example, the National Museum of Ireland recently agreed a Shared Service Agreement on HR shared services and my Department has set up a HR Shared Services Unit to deliver on that.  </p><p>  The Deputies may also wish to note that the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery Cork have been working more closely and this has recently been formally codified by way of a Shared Services Agreement.  This commits each institution to working more closely together in a range of areas including human resources, procurement, conservation and photography services, collection management including cataloguing and digitisation, storage, insurance, enterprise and marketing.    </p><p>  Preliminary estimates for savings provided to me earlier this year indicate that approximately &euro;100,000 will have been saved over the course of 2012 and 2013 through the shared services agenda at the three Galleries.  As I outlined previously, in overall terms it is expected that operational and support savings in the region of approximately &euro;1 million will be initially realised from the reform programme across the institutions involved, which are funded from my Department's Vote Group, with further savings to be identified as the various cost efficiencies are implemented.  This is all against the backdrop of respecting the programming, curatorial and operational independence of the directors.</p></reply>

The purpose of this approach is to generate greater awareness and interest in the annual National Famine Commemoration and to increase the number of potential sites available to choose from each year.  The National Famine Commemoration Committee will meet over the coming weeks with a view to agreeing the 2014 Famine Commemoration Programme and finalising the location of the event in Ireland.</p><p>  In line with previous years, an international event is also being planned to commemorate the Great Irish Famine and it is proposed that New Orleans will be the venue in 2014.  I am confident that the 2014 national and international commemorative events will build on the events held in previous years and will continue to raise public awareness of the Great Irish Famine and of its impact on our history.</p></reply>

One of the key priorities identified by the Ulster-Scots Agency for 2013 is to develop strategic national and international engagements with Scotland and with North America in order to widen access to and appreciation of Ulster-Scots culture and heritage.  I understand that the Ulster-Scots Agency has already undertaken some activities in regard to promotion of Ulster-Scots in North America. For example, the Agency had a presence at <i>The Brits Off Broadway Festival</i> in New York, where it worked with Tourism Ireland to support the <i>Boat Factory</i>  play about Belfast shipbuilding.  The Agency also had an attendance at the Milwaukee Irish Fest through the Young Ambassadors programme, in partnership with St. Patrick's Centre, Downpatrick, and this month an Agency team will attend the Stone Mountain Games in Atlanta, Georgia.  </p><p>  I understand that the Agency is involved in co-operation with Tourism Ireland, including production of a book on the author CS Lewis and provision of publicity for Ulster-Scots culture in marketing initiatives for the USA and Canada.  At home, the Agency is engaging with local councils and others with relevant heritage assets to fill a key gap identified by Tourism Ireland around the development of the Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish tourism content. In that context, the Agency proposes to develop heritage content in Co. Donegal around the stories of Rev Francis Makemie and President Buchanan.</p><p>  The Agency considers that the optimum way to engage the Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish diaspora is through genealogy, heritage and musical connections.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, direct physical engagement with the USA is limited by resources and therefore the goal is limited to 2-3 outward missions per year.  Accordingly, the Agency proposes to focus more on developing its web-based offerings in order to maximise its reach in the US market.  The website , which is currently being developed by the Agency, will be a key component in this regard and will include information about key heritage sites of relevance to Ulster-Scots in Scotland, Ireland and the USA. </p><p>  Finally, I should also refer the Deputy again to the work of Colmcille, the partnership programme between Foras na Gaeilge and Bord na Gaidhlig to promote the use of Irish and Scottish Gaelic within Ireland and Scotland, and also between the two countries.  Further information in this regard is available on the agencies' websites at <font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>and<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></p></reply>

It also promotes and supports community development initiatives and a wide range of language, cultural and educational schemes aimed at strengthening the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.</p><p>  While there is long established cooperation between &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, these links are being strengthened as a result of a Government decision made in this regard in May 2011.  A formal mechanism for cooperation was agreed between &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Enterprise Ireland earlier this year, which will benefit enterprise development in the Gaeltacht.  The Government has also decided that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will maintain responsibility for micro-enterprise and small business supports in the Gaeltacht, in addition to having appropriate access to supports from the new Local Enterprise Offices.</p><p>  Annual funding is provided to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta from my Department's Vote.  This amounts to a total allocation of &euro;18.409 million from the Exchequer in 2013, which &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta supplements with income generated from investments and from the sale of assets.  As a result of investment by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, 689 new jobs were created in the Gaeltacht in 2012.  Total employment in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client companies at year-end was 7,553 jobs, of which 6,933 were full-time jobs and 620 were part-time jobs.</p></reply>

Already the impending occasion has engendered a considerable degree of enthusiasm among historical groups, community agencies and business interests with connections to the marking of this important point in Irish history. </p><p>  Feedback from the wider community, voluntary and not-for-profit institutions, and organisations associated with the planned commemoration has indicated the need to provide co-ordination, technical support and access to existing State services and facilities.  Hence I continue to encourage the co-ordination of the activities of Dublin City Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and agencies and bodies associated with my own Department, with a view to developing a commemorative programme that reflects the influence of the Vikings in Ireland and the Battle of Clontarf as a defining event in our history.</p><p>  The site of the Battle of Clontarf is known to have been on the banks of the river Tolka in Dublin, closer to Glasnevin than to modern-day Clontarf.  Glasnevin Trust has maps from circa 1800 that suggest that the 'bloody acre' &ndash; the historic centre of the battle &ndash; are within what is now its land.  Cognisant of the potential of these events to be of wide tourist interest, I continue to encourage the co-ordination of organisations in Waterford, Killaloe and Ballina in emphasising their Viking Heritage and links to Brian Bor&uacute;, as well as with Dublin City Council and groups from Clontarf, to maximise the potential benefit to these areas from increased tourism. </p><p>  I envisage that the national cultural institutions will play an important role in any commemorative arrangements, especially the National Museum of Ireland.  In that context, I understand that the National Museum intends to hold a major exhibition on Brian Bor&uacute; and the Battle of Clontarf in 2014.  It is expected that the exhibition will have an international focus with loans from institutions across Europe.  The exhibition will not only present Ireland and Europe in the later Viking Age, but also examine the continuing significance of Brian Bor&uacute; and Clontarf in Irish folklore and popular imagination right up to modern times.</p><p>  In addition to possible initiatives by the national cultural institutions, my Department will be consulting with local authorities and other interested parties on their intentions with a view to the development of a co-ordinated programme.  A number of issues are under consideration, including the development of a framework of events and the production of a branding pack or emblem. Decisions on these elements will fall to be made in the coming weeks, having regard to available resources.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB).  The IFB is the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry and I have no responsibility in relation to its day-to-day operational matters, including the allocation of resources to different support programmes and schemes.  The IFB has been allocated &euro;14.037m in 2014 to carry out its functions. </p><p>  In regard to the number of films made with support by the IFB, I would direct the Deputy's attention to the annual reports of the IFB, which are lodged periodically in the Oireachtas Library, and also to the publications by the IFB itself on its website .  It is difficult to predict with certainty the number of films that will be made in the future.  However, consultations between my Department, the IFB and the Department of Finance has resulted in a number of changes to Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (Film Tax Relief Scheme) to ensure that Ireland retains or regains competitiveness in attracting foreign film projects to Ireland. </p><p>  The scheme was extended to the end of 2020 in the 2013 Finance Act and further changes were announced last week by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.  The budget announcement brings forward the new regime for film tax reliefs to 2015, and also extend the definition of 'eligible individual' in the scheme for film relief to include non-EU talent.  This will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allow the audiovisual production sector to maintain existing jobs and hopefully create new ones.</p></reply>

Last week's Budget demonstrated that we have broadly stabilised the funding for overseas development assistance despite the very difficult economic circumstances.  This will enable Ireland to maintain our leading role in contributing to the fight against extreme poverty and hunger in the world, in policy terms and through the achievements on the ground of our internationally recognised aid programme.  For 2014, the Government is providing some &euro;600 million for Official Development Assistance (ODA).  This will represent a small reduction on spending in 2013.  Detailed financial allocations across the aid programme for 2014 will be finalised over the coming months.  I am confident the small reduction on the 2013 allocation can be managed in a way which will not affect our central priorities and core programmes.</p><p>  The Government's new policy on International Development, 'One World, One Future', focuses sharply on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa and on three goals:  reducing hunger, building sustainable growth and good governance.  It provides a clear framework for the prioritisation of activities and the allocation of resources to maximise impact, strengthen accountability and demonstrate value for money over the coming years.  The new policy also reconfirms our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product for ODA, when economic circumstances permit.</p></reply>

Two countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, are in the pre-accession phase.  Ireland is a strong supporter of EU enlargement and we believe it remains one of the EU's most successful policies, fostering peace, stability and prosperity in our neighbouring regions.  We support the efforts of those who have made applications to join the EU and encourage them to fulfil the necessary conditions for membership, in particular the Copenhagen criteria (democracy, the rule of law, respect for fundamental rights and a functioning market economy) as well as the conditions of the Stabilisation and Association Process.</p><p>  In terms of the progress of each country, the European Commission has recently published its annual Enlargement progress reports.  Accession negotiations with Turkey, stalled for some time, were reinvigorated under Ireland's EU Presidency earlier this year and agreement was reached to open a new chapter in the negotiations.  While the handling of the Gezi Park protests raised concerns, it is clear that the EU has a key role to play as an anchor for reform in Turkey through its continued engagement in the accession process. </p><p>  Montenegro has seen progress on its path towards EU membership, following the launch of accession negotiations last year.  First steps have been completed and two chapters (science and research; education and culture) have been closed.  The focus is now on opening two key areas in the negotiations: judiciary and fundamental rights, and justice, freedom and security. </p><p>  This past year has seen real progress by both Serbia and Kosovo on their respective European paths.  In June, there was agreement to open accession negotiations with Serbia by January of next year at the latest and the agreement to open negotiations with Kosovo on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, aimed at bringing it closer to eventual membership of the EU.</p><p>  The European Commission has recently recommended, for the fifth time, that accession negotiations be opened with Macedonia (which has already been granted candidate status) but it remains to be seen if Member States will agree to do so.  The European Commission has also recommended that Albania be granted candidate status, following positive developments, such as cross-party support for key reforms and further steps in the fight against corruption and organised crime.  It will now be for EU Member States to assess if sufficient progress has been made to grant candidate status. </p><p>  In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a lack of political will to implement reforms is hampering the country's EU progress.  Bosnia and Herzegovina have negotiated a Stabilisation and Association agreement with the EU, but this has not yet entered into force.  Finally, there has been no recent progress by Iceland following the decision of the Icelandic government to put its accession negotiations with the EU on hold.  Given the varying pace of progress in each country and the conditions-based nature of the EU accession process, it is not possible to predict when each country will accede to the Union. </p><p>  The redistribution of seats in the European Parliament in advance of the 2014 elections, which resulted in the loss of a seat for Ireland, was necessary to take account of the recent accession of Croatia and to keep the overall number of MEP seats within the maximum of 751 seats set down in Article 14 of the Treaty.  The decision of the European Council applies for the 2014-2019 term only and will be revised on the basis of an initiative to be presented by the European Parliament before the end of 2016.  Ireland's position is that we would have significant concerns if future seat re-distributions continued to be only at the expense of small and medium-sized Member States, as was the case on this occasion.</p><p>  Building on the success of the Irish Presidency of the Council, the Government is committed to maintaining a high level of engagement with the European Parliament, including regular presence by Irish Ministers at plenary sessions in Strasbourg for meetings with a wide range of MEPs and our own MEPs.  This enhanced level of engagement aims to ensure that Ireland's national interests are represented and communicated to the key decision-makers in the Parliament, and this will include promoting our interest in a fair representation for Ireland when current seat allocations are reviewed again following the election of the new Parliament in May 2014 and in the context of any further enlargement of the EU.</p></reply>

Their &quot;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&quot; includes a wide range of measures that are designed to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.</p><p>Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also carry out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets.  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.  The Revenue Commissioners assure me that they are committed to maintaining their extensive programme of action against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products, and that they will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.</p><p>Details of cigarettes and tobacco products seized during the years 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, are set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Cigarettes</th><th>-</th><th>Tobacco</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>No. of Seizures</td><td>Quantity (million)</td><td>No. of Seizures</td><td>Quantity (kilograms)</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>10,610</td><td>218.5m</td><td>1,171</td><td>10,451</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>9,026</td><td>178.4m</td><td>1,171</td><td>3,367</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>10,581</td><td>109.1m</td><td>1,500</td><td>11,158</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>8,108</td><td>95.6m</td><td>1,395</td><td>5,277</td></tr></table></p><p>The numbers of convictions in the years in question, for offences concerning the smuggling or sale of illicit tobacco products, that resulted in either fines or custodial sentences are given in the following table, together with details of the numbers of custodial sentences imposed.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. of Convictions (Fines or Custodial Sentences)</th><th>Custodial Sentences*</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>164</td><td>45 (21)</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>138</td><td>21 (13)</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>161</td><td>45 (28)</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>132</td><td>47 (20)</td></tr></table></p><p>(*Figures in brackets indicate the numbers of custodial sentences that were suspended)</p></reply>

The new ceilings will ensure continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase standard policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.  </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is estimated that up to 577,000 policy holders, which provide cover for 1.1 million individuals, may be affected by this measure.  However, I should point out that many of these will only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals purchase.  In addition, individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure entirely.</p></reply>

One of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> - the reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services - was due to end this year. In my Budget speech, I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate and I indicated that the yield from the additional 0.15% pension fund levy in 2014 and the reduced levy of 0.15% in 2015 would continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> and also help to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties. In this context, for example, the cost of continuing with the reduced 9% VAT rate is estimated at &euro;350 million in a full year while the additional yield from the changes to the levy in 2014 and 2015 is estimated at &euro;135 million in each year. As I have indicated, the proceeds from the levy will accrue to the Exchequer and expenditure decisions on the use of those and other funds will be made as they arise in the normal way. </p></reply>

The continued applicability of the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and Mortgage Arrears Targets Programme will depend on the regulatory status of the ultimate acquirer of the portfolio which we will not know until the sales process has concluded. In the event that NAMA ultimately acquires this portfolio, the NAMA Board will determine its strategy at that stage and will, in doing so, be mindful of its legal obligations.   The Special Liquidators confirm that all Borrowers can re-finance their borrowings at par with other lending institutions.

Borrowers were presented with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for loan assets. Decisions concerning the sale and disposal of loan assets are a matter for the Special Liquidators and I have no role in the process.</p><p>  Should a bid not be received by a qualified bidder that is equal to or in excess of the Valuation Price, then the asset/portfolio will transfer to NAMA.

I also informed the House that the Revenue Commissioners had confirmed that if a liable person had genuinely overpaid the tax through an error or mistake, then the person should write to LPT Branch, Government Buildings, Ennis, Co Clare, clearly setting out how the overpayment arose and providing the relevant supporting documentation. </p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that once the relevant documentation is received LPT Branch will make direct contact with the person.

Further High Court applications were made to extend the term of appointment of the Special Manager, the latest being in June 2013, and High Court Orders were secured for a 6 month extension period on each occasion.</p><p>  The Central Bank undertook a process under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, involving the examination of possible combinations with other credit unions.  As part of this process, Naas Credit Union submitted a proposal to the Central Bank, setting out the basis upon which Naas Credit Union would be prepared to combine with Newbridge.  </p><p>  At the request of the Governor of the Central Bank, I have confirmed that I am prepared, in principle, to support the proposal.  However, the proposal remains subject to amongst other things due diligence, completion of relevant documentation, Naas Credit Union board approval, regulatory consideration and High Court approval.  I expect that these steps will be completed expeditiously and that the Naas/Newbridge combination will be finalised by the end of this year. This will necessitate a significant capital investment of taxpayers' funds into Newbridge Credit Union to cover the losses at Newbridge and to ensure the protection of members' savings and the stability of Newbridge into the future. The successful combination of these credit unions is considered the best way to ensure the continuity of credit union services for members in Newbridge. </p><p>  Newbridge Credit Union Action group has submitted an alternative proposal to me regarding Newbridge Credit Union. I have referred the proposal to the Governor of the Central Bank for examination with a view to arranging a meeting between the Central Bank and the Newbridge Credit Union Action Group.</p><p>  Section 91 of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 provides that the Central Bank may direct a credit institution to prepare a recovery plan setting out actions that could be taken to facilitate the continuation, or secure the business or part of the business, of that credit institution in a situation where the institution is experiencing financial instability.  The Central Bank has not issued such a direction to Newbridge Credit Union. As Minister for Finance I have no role in the exercise by the Central Bank of its functions in respect of recovery plans.</p></reply>

Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  There is no provision in the EU VAT Directive that would make it possible to exempt from VAT or apply a zero rate to the supply of such products.     Under the VAT (Refund of Tax) (No.15) Order, 1981 it is possible for individuals to obtain repayment of VAT expended on certain goods and appliances which assist persons with a disability to overcome that disability.  In this context, a defibrillator purchased by or on behalf of an individual may qualify for a VAT refund.

In order to qualify for relief an individual must show that he or she has incurred &ldquo;health expenses&rdquo; for the provision of &ldquo;health care&rdquo;.  It is not the case that all expenses incurred on health care qualify for relief.  For the purposes of section 469 "health care" is the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability.  Health expenses include the cost of treatment necessarily incurred in connection with the services of a medical practitioner.   Given the nature of the treatment involved, it is clear that dialysis is necessarily undertaken in connection with the services of a medical practitioner.  It is carried out under ongoing medical supervision.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the granting of a deduction in respect of electricity usage by kidney dialysis patients was only determined after extensive consideration of the particular nature of their medical condition. Differing levels of relief in respect of electricity costs have been allowed depending on whether a patient requires home dialysis or is a Chronic Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) patient.  The level of relief in respect of electricity costs for such dialysis patients is determined by reference to the annual consumption of electricity based on dialysis being undertaken a number of times each day, including necessary preparatory work.</p><p>  Health expenses also include the supply, maintenance or repair of any medical surgical, dental or nursing appliance used on the advice of a practitioner.  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the on-going cost of operating an appliance is not allowable unless the appliance is used in connection with the services of a medical practitioner and is used subject to ongoing medical supervision. </p><p>  If respirators are used on the advice of a medical practitioner and under medical supervision, then, I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to consider the question of relief for the cost of the electricity used to run the machine.   My officials will forward any submission in this regard to the Revenue Commissioners for their consideration.</p></reply>

The Commissioners advise me that there is a short form of IT 38 which may be submitted on line or in paper form, and this is used in the simpler straightforward cases for example where no relief/exemption/credit is claimed, apart from the small gift exemption or where the property included in the return was taken from only one disponer and is not part of a larger benefit or series of benefits. </p><p>  On the other hand where the circumstances of the gift or inheritance taken by a beneficiary are complicated by factors such as them claiming the more complex reliefs from CAT or, where the benefit they are taking is not an absolute interest, taxpayers are obliged to complete the long version of the Form IT 38 that must be filed online through the Revenue Online Service (ROS).  Because of the complexity, it is the Commissioners' experience that these type of cases are generally handled by a solicitor or tax practitioner and in these circumstances filing online should not present any difficulty.</p><p>  In line with the Government's policy on e-Government and e-payments, Revenue's stated strategic objective is to establish the use of electronic channels as the normal way of providing services to taxpayers and this, it seems to me, is a reasonable approach.  Filing and paying taxes online is easier, more accurate, more efficient and taxpayers get more time to file.  </p><p>A<b></b>  taxpayer who is not using an agent such as a solicitor to handle the relevant gifts or inheritances and wishes to file the long form IT Form IT 38 themselves, will, I am advised find it much easier to do so on line than on paper.  The design of ROS ensures that the online form is simpler and quicker to complete. As information is entered, the system progressively customises the screens that have to be completed, thus minimising the number of screens and options presented.  In addition, ROS holds up-to-date rates of tax, indexed group threshold amounts and other key data that ensure the correct tax due is automatically calculated once certain details are input by the taxpayer.  Calculating the CAT liability on paper returns is significantly more difficult for taxpayers than using ROS as they have to enter the figures on the Return form and compute the liability themselves.</p><p>  In addition, using the online IT 38 Return results in speedier processing by the Revenue Commissioners which in turn, in the case of inheritances, ensures that the administration of Estates are quicker, more efficient and less costly for the Estate and the ultimate beneficiaries.</p><p>  The Deputy refers to people who may not be ROS registered or have no computer access. Registration can be arranged in such cases, and there is a dedicated ROS Helpdesk available at tel:1890201106. In the unlikely circumstances of a more complex case not being handled by a solicitor, the taxpayer can make a case to Revenue to be excluded from their obligation to pay and file electronically if Revenue is satisfied that the taxpayer does not have the capacity to do so.  A person who considers that he/she may qualify for an exclusion should apply in writing to the local Revenue district.</p><p>  For this purpose, &#8220;capacity&#8221; means sufficient access to the Internet and, in the case of an individual, also means not prevented by reason of age, or mental or physical infirmity from making a specified return or paying any specified liabilities by electronic means.  Where Revenue does not approve a request for exclusion, the taxpayer has a right to make a formal appeal to the Appeal Commissioners.</p><p>  Finally, while the long form IT 38 must be filed electronically, the Revenue Commissioners confirm that taxpayers can pay their CAT liabilities either electronically through ROS or alternatively directly to the Collector General by cheque, for example.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information in the regulations did not make it possible to accurately identify the relevant properties.   I am further advised that the difficulties in the case referred to by the Deputy occurred because the person in question failed to make contact with Revenue on foot of either the original issue of the LPT 1 Return in March 2013 or the subsequent reminder in August 2013.  The August reminder specifically advised the person of the imminent commencement of mandatory deduction at source from his income if he did not complete the LPT 1 Return and indicate either a payment option or an entitlement to deferral or exemption.  Because the person still did not engage with Revenue, an instruction issued to his employer to commence deductions.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue conducted a comprehensive communications programme at the commencement of the LPT, which clearly outlined the obligations on property owners to file their LPT 1 Return and confirm either their liability to the tax or their entitlement to relief or exemption from it.  Revenue stated it would seek to collect the estimated amount, which was included with the LPT 1 Return, in circumstances of non-payment or non-engagement.  Revenue also confirmed that it would deploy its various enforcement options, including mandatory deduction from a defaulting person's income, where it was necessary to do so to secure payment. </p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that Revenue has now received a completed LPT 1 Return in respect of the property in question claiming exemption on the basis of a 'listed' unfinished estate.  On the basis of the information supplied, Revenue has issued instructions to the person's employer to cease the mandatory deductions.  Revenue has also confirmed that it will shortly make direct contact with the person in question to arrange a refund of the monies deducted.</p></reply>

Each team comprises a detector dog and handler, and the dogs are used in the detection of drugs, tobacco and cash.   While the detector dog teams are deployed primarily within their regions of assignment, they are also available for deployment elsewhere, as required. Revenue also ensures that the teams maintain a high visibility at the ports, airports, postal depots and freight forwarders' premises in which they routinely operate. In addition, the teams assist in operations carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whenever requested to do so.</p><p>  The experience of the Revenue Commissioners is that detector dog teams play an important part in detecting illicit drugs and tobacco and the illegal movement of cash.  The number of teams was increased substantially in recent years. Arrangements are currently in train for the replacement of two detector dogs that were taken out of service this year, and for the acquisition of two further dogs that will be trained to detect tobacco and cash. This will bring the number of detector dog teams to 17, and the Revenue Commissioners consider that that complement will provide the requisite support for their work in detecting and seizing illegal drugs and tobacco products and cash. The position will, however, be kept under review on an ongoing basis, in light of emerging circumstances and requirements.	</p></reply>

AMRFs are part of the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) regime introduced in 1999.  The ARF regime gives a considerable degree of control, flexibility and personal choice to individuals in Defined Contribution pension arrangements in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans.  These choices include the options to purchase an annuity, to receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. </p><p>  Under the regime, the options to:</p><p>  - invest in an ARF, or</p><p>  - receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate)</p><p>  are subject to conditions.  The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (specified income) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. Finance Act 2011 increased the guaranteed level of pension income required from the previous fixed amount of &euro;12,700 introduced in 1999, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) bringing the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; requirement to &euro;18,000 per annum. In Finance Act 2013, I rescinded this increase and reinstated the original lower specified income requirement of &euro;12,700 on the grounds that the Finance Act 2011 change did not provide for adequate transitional arrangements to allow individuals to adjust to the increased pension income requirement. </p><p>  Where the specified income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum is met by an AMRF owner at any time after retirement and before age 75, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF with full access to the funds, subject to taxation as appropriate. It should also be borne in mind that (irrespective of the level of guaranteed pension income) an AMRF owner can access the funds in an AMRF at any time for the purpose of purchasing a pension annuity.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the current difficult financial environment, Revenue expects businesses to have a clear focus on maintaining payment compliance and on meeting their obligations in full and on time.  Where late or non-compliance occurs, Revenue will always try to resolve the issues through engagement with the business or taxpayer in advance of deploying enforcement sanctions.  However, where that engagement fails or is not forthcoming then Revenue will utilise appropriate collection enforcement measures, including referral to Sheriffs, to pursue outstanding tax debts.</p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that Sheriffs are Officers of the Court, under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945.  Their debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, (as amended) and the execution of Revenue warrants by Sheriffs is specifically provided for in Section 962 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, (as amended).  Sheriffs are answerable before the Courts for any breach of the civil debt collection code and are not directly accountable to Revenue in relation to their operational activities.  For this reason Revenue does not collate specific data on seizures and is not in a position to provide the tabular data requested by the Deputy.</p><p>  However, I am advised that Revenue understands that Sheriffs only undertake seizures in a very small minority of cases and only after the defaulting taxpayer has not engaged with requests for payment.  Finally Revenue has informed me that the Sheriffs operate a Code of Practice in relation to their tax collection enforcement activities.  The Code includes a complaints procedure that assists taxpayers in resolving disputes with Sheriffs without the necessity of initiating Court proceedings.  The Code is not a substitution for a persons legal entitlement and its use does not prevent a person from applying to the Courts should they subsequently feel it is necessary to do so.</p><p>  A copy of the Code is attached for the Deputy's information.</p><p><b><i>Sheriff's Code of Practice </i></b></p><p>  The following is the Code of Practice operated by the Sheriff's Office in relation to dealings with taxpayers: </p><p><b>1. The Sheriff will:</b></p><p>  - Treat every taxpayer with courtesy;</p><p>  - Where practicable, notify the taxpayer in writing of the lodgement of a certificate in the Sheriff's Office;</p><p>  - Where requested, explain to the taxpayer the purpose of the visit of the Sheriff, Bailiff or other staff;</p><p>  - When goods are seized, issue as soon as possible, a written inventory to the taxpayer;</p><p>  - Furnish the taxpayer with a receipt for monies paid;</p><p>  - Furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized.</p><p><b>2. In return the Sheriff expects that the Taxpayer will:</b></p><p>  - Pay liabilities to the Sheriff on demand;</p><p>  - Be prompt in his/her dealings with the Sheriff's office;</p><p>  - Treat the Sheriff and his staff with courtesy. </p><p><b>3. Complaints:</b></p><p>  - If the taxpayer feels aggrieved at the way in which his/her case is handled, complain in writing to the Sheriff's office;</p><p>  - The Sheriff shall investigate any such complaint and respond as promptly as is practicable in the circumstances;</p><p>  - Should the taxpayer remain aggrieved at the Sheriff's response, he/she may refer the complaint to the Revenue Commissioners in writing. The Revenue Commissioners will examine any such complaint and may request that the Sheriff undertake a review.</p><p>  - Should the taxpayer remain aggrieved at the outcome of the Sheriff's review, the complaint may at his/her request be referred to the Joint Standing Committee (JSC) of the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs' Association. The JSC will review the issue(s)by means of an examination of all the relevant correspondence and documentation. [The JSC is made up of an equal number of representatives from the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs Association, with a neutral Chairman.]</p><p>  - Where a complaint involves an allegation of criminal behaviour against a sheriff, his agents, or staff, then the Joint Standing Committee shall decline to deal with it.</p><p>  - The referral of any matter to the Joint Standing Committee is not in any way to be taken as a diminution or a substitution for a taxpayer's common law rights, which are not interfered with by availing of the said process.</p></reply>

Accordingly, combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for them.  Revenue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&rdquo; includes a wide range of measure that are designed to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and third country basis, ongoing review of operational policies, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also carry out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets.</p><p>  There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade.  In addition, the relevant agencies in the State work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, including Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs and the PSNI, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.</p><p>  I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they are committed to maintaining their extensive programme of action against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products, and that they will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.  Determining the scale of any illegal activity, and the tax loss that it causes, is problematic, and estimates of such loss need to be approached with caution.  Surveys on the incidence of the consumption of illicit cigarettes carried out in 2011 and 2012, for the Revenue Commissioners and the Health Services Executive, indicate losses of the order of &euro;258 million and &euro;240 million, in Tobacco Products Tax and VAT, in those years.

From 2015, the supply of these services to private individuals will be taxed by reference to where the customers are located.  The supplier would normally be obliged to register and pay VAT in all the Member States of their customers but, in order to reduce costs for business, a Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) will be introduced that offers an alternative simplified process for charging and remitting VAT to the appropriate Member States.  Under this regime, a supplier who has a place of supply or a fixed establishment in, say, Ireland, may register for VAT in Ireland and use the MOSS system to make a single return setting out his or her supplies to private individuals in other Member States.  There is no transitional period for businesses involved in these supplies; the new legislation will apply from 1st January 2015.  Member States will be allowed to retain a percentage of the VAT payments made through their MOSS system during the period 2015 &ndash; 2018.  The retention percentage will be 30% of the VAT payments to be transferred to other Member States for 2015 and 2016, and 15% for 2017 and 2018.</p><p>  Under the new regime Ireland will receive VAT revenues from supplies of telecommunications services, broadcasting services or electronic services to private individuals in the State from suppliers established in other Member States.  On the other hand, Ireland will lose VAT revenues on similar supplies to private individuals in other Member States made by businesses established in the State.  It is not possible to estimate the additional VAT revenues that will be collected in the State on the basis of the new regime.  However, as the new regime will eliminate the existing incentive for businesses engaged in these supplies to establish in Member States with lower VAT rates, the effect is likely to be positive.</p></reply>

I stated at the time that the proposed scheme would be subject to a full ex-ante cost benefit analysis and would require State Aid approval from the European Commission.  The cost benefit analysis was recently presented to my Department and has been published on the Department's website.  On foot of the recommendations contained in this independent report, I made an announcement in my 2014 Budget Statement that I was proposing to extend the Initiative to include designated areas of four other cities.  Certain other technical amendments would also be proposed in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</p><p>  Following the receipt of the report, an application for EU State Aid approval will be submitted shortly to the European Commission and the evidence presented in the cost benefit analysis will form part of this application.  The Initiative cannot be commenced until EU State Aid approval is received and so there are no numbers on uptake to report.</p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing One-Parent Family Tax Credit and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The new credit will be targeted such that it is available only to the primary carer of the child.  A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child and there will be no facility to apportion the credit between parents.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on the most up to date data it is estimated that up to 15,400 individuals may be affected by the restriction of the restructured credit to the principal carer.  However, ultimately it will depend on the circumstances of each individual carer.</p></reply>

This comprised &euro;2.5bn in expenditure cuts and tax increases complemented with additional resources/other savings of &euro;0.6bn.  A summary table of the adjustment package is outlined as follows.</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>&euro;bn</th></tr><tr><td>Expenditure measures</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>Current expenditure measures</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Increase in savings from Prior Year Measures</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditure measures</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Taxation measures</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td>Net new measures</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue carryover</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Other </td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td>Total Adjustment Package</td><td>3.1</td></tr></table></p><p>Additional detail on what encompasses the other elements on the adjustment package was requested.  Firstly, the NTMA Budget debt service estimate for 2014 is lower than the corresponding April SPU estimate, of the order &euro;0.2bn, due to an improvement in the interest rate environment generally and lower than previously planned bond issuance.  Turning to the Central Bank income, during the summer, the Central Bank provided an estimate of the 2013 surplus income to be paid to the Central Fund in 2014 based on results to that date and projections for the remainder of the year.  The Central Bank revised this estimate upwards by &euro;0.1bn in September, in light of actual results for the first nine months and the consequent revisions or projections for the remaining three months of 2013.  In terms of savings from the Live Register, the numbers in work rose by 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013 and the Live Register at the end of quarter 3 2013 was down by just over 20,000 when compared to the same period last year.  On foot of this recovering labour market, live register savings have exceeded those previously expected or the order &euro;0.15bn.  Finally, the remaining &euro;0.15bn arises from a number of other factors mainly connected with state asset transactions.</p><p>Complementing tax and expenditure measures with additional resources and other savings, some of which may be once off, is consistent with the composition of previous adjustments published in the National Recovery Plan / Budget 2011 and the contribution of additional dividends outlined in Budget 2013.  All of the &euro;3.1bn adjustment announced in Budget 2014, as set out in the table above, will impact the general government deficit for 2014.</p></reply>

As I announced in my Budget 2014 speech last week, the changes I am introducing to deliver on the commitment I made in Budget 2013 in the supplementary pensions area involve a reduction from 1 January 2014 in the value of the maximum allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes (the Standard Fund Threshold &ndash; SFT) from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million and an increase from the current single factor of 20 used to value Defined Benefit pensions for SFT purposes to a range of higher factors varying with the age at which the pension is drawn down.  This latter change will place a higher capital value for SFT purposes on Defined Benefit pension entitlements accrued after 1 January 2014 and drawn down at retirement.  The use of a range of capitalisation factors will improve the equity of the SFT regime as between Defined Contribution and Defined Benefit pension arrangements and between those retiring at earlier ages and those retiring at older ages.</p><p>  The yield from the changes being made to the SFT regime is estimated at &euro;120 million in 2014 and in a full year.  It is not possible to differentiate the estimated yield between the impact of the reduced SFT and the change to the valuation factors.</p><p>  In line with legal advices, the changes to the SFT and the use of higher valuation factors will apply prospectively from 1 January 2014.  Members of pension schemes and individuals with pension savings whose pension entitlements or savings have a value on 1 January 2014 above the reduced SFT of &euro;2 million and up to the value of the current SFT of &euro;2.3 million may (as on the occasions when the SFT was first introduced and subsequently reduced) protect the capital value of those rights by submitting a claim for a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) to the Revenue Commissioners.  Revised arrangements for making a PFT notification to Revenue are being provided for in the forthcoming Finance Bill. Pension rights arising under Defined Benefit arrangements have to be valued on 1 January 2014 for PFT purposes using the current standard valuation factor of 20.  In the case of rights arising under Defined Contribution arrangements, the capital value for PFT purposes remains, as before, the value of the assets in the arrangement that represent the member&rsquo;s accumulated rights on that date i.e. the value of the fund on that date.</p><p>  The valuation factor to be used for establishing the capital value of an individual&rsquo;s Defined Benefit pension rights at the point of retirement, where this takes place after 1 January 2014, is being changed from the current standard factor of 20 to a higher age&ndash;related factor that will vary with the individual&rsquo;s age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down.  The age&ndash;related factors are set out in a table on page B.24 of the Budget booklet and range from 37 for Defined Benefit pension rights drawn down at age 50 or under, to a factor of 22 where they are drawn down at age 70 or over.  Full details of the changes being introduced will be included in the Finance Bill which is being published on 24 October.</p></reply>

This is particularly important as we target an exit from the EU/IMF programme of support and the Government has recognised this in the ECF numbers and resources allocated to the Department.  Notwithstanding this, my Department has achieved considerable economies in a number of areas through, for example, the abolition of payable orders, efficiencies in accommodation footprint, and process improvement efficiencies.  The full extent of these efficiencies is not immediately obvious because the Department has taken-on additional clients in the shared services area (these services are not recharged to the clients) and premises lease savings will accrue to the Office of Public Works vote.</p><p>  During the course of 2014 my Department will incur once-off funding costs in relation to a number of policy areas, including the Government approved National Payments Plan project.  We have also included an estimate for legal fees related to actions linked to the banking sector.  These additional costs exceed the various cost savings expected to be achieved in 2014 relating to improved work practices.</p></reply>

The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  A change in VAT rates must be in compliance with the EU VAT Directive.  The VAT Directive generally provides that supplies of goods and services be chargeable to VAT at the standard rate but that lower rates are permitted in very limited circumstances.  Food products can only benefit from the zero rating in accordance with Article 110 of the VAT Directive which permits the retention of the zero rate for &ldquo;clearly defined social reasons&rdquo; where the products were liable to VAT at the zero rate on 1 January 1991.  This does not apply in the case of the health supplements referred to by the Deputy, and as such it is not possible to introduce a zero rate on these products.</p></reply>

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for allocation in the 2013/14 school year.  The Deputy will be aware that the previous Government, as part of the Programme for National Recovery, introduced a cap on the number of Special Needs Assistants.  This figure was set at 10,575 posts and has remained in place since the 2011/12 school year. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  The NCSE has notified schools of their SNA allocation for 2013/14, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children. </p><p>  It is important to note that the level of SNAs required to support children with special educational needs changes from year to year in line with the enrolment of different children with different care needs.  The care needs of individual children can also change from year to year.  The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.  To date the NCSE has allocated 10,490 WTE SNA posts to schools.  Every child who meets the criteria for access to SNA support in the current school year is in receipt of this support.  The remaining 85 posts are available for allocation throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme.  Based on discussions with the NCSE, it may be the case that additional SNA posts above the figure of 10,575, may be required to respond to need for the current school year.  This issue will be dealt with if and when it arises.  The NCSE is still processing SNA applications for the current school year.</p><p>  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the SNA allocations were made, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them for the current school year.  In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school. </p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

All recognised schools, regardless of their philosophy, are required to comply with the Education Act 1998 and the Rules for National Schools.</p><p>  Officials from my Department met with the school concerned in September 2012 at which it was agreed that a number of issues had to be addressed by the school so as to satisfy the Department's requirements for permanent recognition.  Both the Department and school concerned have committed to ongoing engagement, and the Department's inspectorate agreed to provide a number of advisory/support visits to the school to assist them in making progress to fulfil the requirements.  The first set of the advisory visits occurred in the last academic year and further visits are scheduled.</p><p>  It was also agreed that the school would have their period of provisional recognition extended by three years to allow them adequate time to reach the requirements.

The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p><p>  Under the new procedures for schools, it is made clear that the primary aim in investigating and dealing with bullying is to resolve any issues and to restore, as far as is practicable, the relationships of the parties involved rather than an approach based on apportioning  blame.  The procedures provide that in investigating and dealing with bullying, the teacher will exercise his/her professional judgement to determine whether bullying has occurred and how best the situation might be resolved.</p><p>  The recording template to which the Deputy refers applies to cases where the relevant teacher has determined that bullying behaviour occurred and where the teacher concerned considers that it has not been adequately and appropriately addressed within 20 school days after he/she has determined that bullying behaviour has occurred.  The procedures provide that in determining whether a bullying case has been adequately and appropriately addressed the relevant teacher must, as part of his/her professional judgement take the following factors into account::<blockquote>- Whether the bullying behaviour has ceased;<br /><br />- Whether any issues between the parties have been resolved as far as is practicable;<br /><br />- Whether the relationships between the parties have been restored as far as is practicable; and<br /><br />- Any feedback received from the parties involved, their parents or the school Principal or Deputy Principal</blockquote>  Importantly, these procedures have been developed with the input and consensus of the relevant education partners and thereby give a real opportunity to reinvigorate and strengthen our approach to preventing and tackling bullying in schools.  Bullying can have a devastating effect on our children and young people and the publication of these procedures is one more step towards putting an end to it.</p></reply>

Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The role of the SENO in planning for the transition of children from one stage of schooling to another can include the provision of information to parents and or liaising between schools and parents.  The NEPS psychologists can also be involved in supporting the transition of pupils with complex special needs. Information including general principles for planning for transitioning are also available on the NCSE website.</p></reply>

When the Minor Works Grant last issued in November 2011 for the school year 2011/2012, I stated that given the need to focus on meeting the demand for additional school places, it was unlikely that funding would be available for the Minor Works Grant in the coming years.  This is borne out by the fact that in 2012, 85% of the capital expenditure in the school sector was in respect of large scale projects, additional accommodation and prefab replacement.  The balance was expended on site acquisition, emergency works, furniture and equipment provision and commitments arising from earlier years.</p><p>  The capital allocation available for the school sector in 2013 is expected to have a similar spend pattern as was the case in 2012.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-22a.356.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013102200059#WRH00400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.</p><p>  Firstly, I would point out that the allocation of SNA resources is not a matter for this Department but is instead an independent function carried out by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), who are responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports including resource teaching and SNA support as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The number of SNAs employed in a school depends on the allocation given to the school by the NCSE, based on its assessment of the special educational needs of pupils in the school.  If you require further information regarding the allocation of SNA resources to schools then your query should more appropriately be directed to the NCSE.</p><p>  In relation to your question regarding working hours for SNAs the position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in the standard SNA contract of employment, which was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. </p><p>  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement).  The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant.  Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited.  Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.  This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;</p></reply>

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>  The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.  Circular 071/2011 provides additional details in respect of the duties of an SNA and makes clear the fact that SNA duties are assigned at the discretion of the Principal.  I can also advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has also published an Information Booklet for Parents in relation to Children with Special Educational Needs, which provides information for parents in relation to the SNA scheme.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support each year.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  My Department has also published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme.  This review is available on my Department's website: www.education.gov.ie.  The Review has shown that the SNA Scheme has been successful in supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  However, the review also found that the allocation process and the purpose of the scheme is not always fully understood.</p><p>  The review recommended that the SNA scheme should be restated to ensure an efficient allocation of SNA resources and to clarify the 'care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals.  The National Council for Special Education recently published its report on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which also recommended that my Department should clarify the role of the SNA, as recommended in the VFM report.  It is my intention that a new Circular will be issued to schools in the near future which will provide further clarification for schools and parents with regard to the role of the SNA and the purpose of the SNA scheme.</p></reply>

The SPHE curricula aim to foster self-worth, self -confidence and respectful relationships and place a particular emphasis on developing a sense of personal responsibility for one's own behaviour, feelings and actions.</p><p>  The issue of smoking is addressed in the 'Personal Safety' strand of SPHE, in the context of equipping students with the skills to recognise and withstand inappropriate peer pressure and to identify the dangers of substance abuse.  For example, SPHE students at Junior Cycle explore the health and social implications of smoking and identify some of the reasons why young people smoke.  Students are also helped to identify ways in which smoking can be avoided. Enabling students to make informed decisions and choices is an inherent aim in the teaching and learning within SPHE.  SPHE is delivered for 30 minutes per week at primary level, and for approximately 66 hours during the three years of junior cycle.  The approach to SPHE is changing at Junior Cycle.  As part of the reform of the Junior Cycle that was announced by the Minister of Education and Skills in October 2012, the key objectives of SPHE are now reflected in a number of 'Principles', 'Statements of Learning', and skills that underpin the new Junior Cycle Framework. </p><p>  As part of the new 'Well-being' principle, the student experience will &quot;contribute to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience.  Learning takes place in a climate focussed on collective well-being of school, community and society&quot;.  Under the new Junior Cycle Framework, pupils will be provided with opportunities to acquire the relevant skills of 'Managing Myself', 'Staying well', and 'Communicating'.  Together the development of these skills will enable pupils to address the challenges they face and adapt their skills to different contexts, leading to their positive well-being.</p><p>  As part of the new Junior Cycle Framework, the NCCA is currently developing a new short course in SPHE.  The SPHE short course may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle  up to 100 hours over the three years.  This short course is currently open for public consultation.  The consultation process will close at the end of November.  The new short course will be available to schools from September 2014.  Schools will then have the option to implement the new SPHE short course, or to continue to use existing courses or to adopt an alternative approach to meeting their requirements in this area.</p></reply>

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  Students must meet both the nationality and residency criterion in order to be considered under the scheme.</p><p>  Where students do not qualify for free fees they must pay the appropriate fee as determined by their third level institution.  The institutions are autonomous institutions and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees schemes is a matter for the relevant institution.  However, I recently requested that the Higher Education Authority establish and report on the practices currently operated by individual institutions in charging different rates of fees so as to ensure  a common approach across the sector and that all prospective students have clarity about the level of tuition fees they may be required to pay. </p><p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.  Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria, including developing grounds, to an independent Appeals Board. The criteria for the allocation of a developing school post for the 2013/14 school year are set out in the staffing schedule, Circular 0013/2013.  Schools that meet the criteria may receive sanction for additional post(s) pending the confirmation of the valid enrolment on 30th September 2013.</p><p>  Valid enrolments are only those pupils that are enrolled at 30 September 2013 and who are expected at that stage to continue to be enrolled in the school for the duration of the school year.

The school referred to by the Deputy applied for and received provisional sanction for one additional classroom post on developing school grounds.

Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.

This policy advice is available at www.ncse.ie.  This publication provides details of the disabilities which qualify for low-incidence resource hours and also details the approximate number of number of students for whom low incidence resource teaching hours were allocated to schools for the academic year 2012-13.  This report details the allocation for resource teaching hours by disability category, and shows that there were 1,110 pupils in mainstream education in receipt of low incidence resource hours with a disability categorisation of Deafness/hearing impairment during the 2012 - 2013 school year.  This includes 693 pupils at primary level and 417 pupils at post primary level.  There are also 16 special classes for children with hearing impairment attached to mainstream schools, with 10 special classes being attached to mainstream primary schools, and 6 special class at post-primary level. </p><p>  The pupil teacher ratio for special classes for children who are deaf of hard of hearing is 7-1, which equates to provision for approximately 112 children being supported in special classes in mainstream schools, though the numbers attending special classes may vary throughout the year, as pupils transition between special class and mainstream education.  In addition, the report also indicates that for the 2012/13 school year, there were approximately 120 children enrolled in the three special schools for the deaf.  </p><p>  It is clear, therefore, that the majority of pupils who are deaf or hard of hearing are therefore now being educated in mainstream schools, either in mainstream classes with additional supports, or in special classes attached to mainstream schools.  Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is provided in these schools and classes, as required.  An enhanced capitation grant is also provided to the special schools and special classes for hearing impaired pupils.  Grant-aid is also provided to schools towards the provision of special equipment for pupils who are hard of hearing, such as sound field systems and radio aids. </p><p>  My Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing preschool children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents.  In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education.  The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met.  This service is available at preschool, primary and post-primary levels.  Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of preschool children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available. </p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise that my Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bilingualism and sociolinguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.</p></reply>

My Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.  These supports include an allocation of additional teaching support as well as additional resource teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) care supports which may be allocated to schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in respect of qualifying pupils. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools. This policy advice is available at www.ncse.ie.  This publication details that for the 2012/13 school year, there were approximately 31,202 pupils in mainstream education in receipt of resource teaching allocations. It also notes that for the 2012/13 school year that there were approximately 3,678 pupils attending special classes attached to mainstream schools, and 7094 pupils attending special schools.  </p><p>  While provision of Individual Education Plans (IEPs) is not currently mandatory, they are recognised as an important feature of good educational practice and schools are encouraged to use IEPs through policy guidance, support, training and inspection. A range of guidance has issued on the use of IEPs, including guidelines published by the NCSE, guidance published by the National Educational Psychology Service (NEPS) and training is provided by my Department's Special Education Support Service. The advice of my Department's Inspectorate is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.</p><p>  I wish to explain also that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website. Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. </p><p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  The responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational resources to be allocated to pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO.</p><p>Assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals are provided by schools to the SENOs as part of the application process for support. The consideration of these reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs. </p><p>  The NCSE circular 03/08 clarifies the respective roles and functions of the NCSE and the HSE and their respective personnel in carrying out assessments and sanctioning resources to support children with special educational needs.  For children under the age of 5, the NCSE, through its network of SENOs, liaises with Assessment Officers in the Health Service Executive (HSE) in respect of the assessment of need process under the 2005 Disability Act, 2005.  The Assessment Officer contacts the relevant SENO when an educational need is identified as part of the assessment process. My Department's Circular 0020/2011 further clarifies the roles of the NCSE and the HSE in relation to the assessment of need process, as well as the role of the school in this regard. This Circular is available on my Departments website at www.education.ie. </p><p>  I wish to advise that my Department will continue to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs and will continue to work with service-providing partners in the health and disability sectors through the interdepartmental Cross-Sectoral Team (comprising of representatives of: the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Children, the National Council for Special Education and the Health Service Executive), which plans for co-ordinated service delivery across the disability sector.</p><p>  Finally, I can advise that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which is available on its website www.ncse.ie.  The report recommends that under a new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in the report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new model for the allocation of teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.</p></reply>

In this regard, Minister of State Brian Hayes worked closely with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. I believe that there is considerable support both inside and outside the D&aacute;il for these reforms. The Act which is subject to a Commencement Order, to allow for the development of a comprehensive code of practice, was signed into law on the 29 July 2013.</p><p>  The key objective of the Construction Contracts Act is to ensure that cash flows down the supply chain on all construction contracts. This issue is addressed in the Act by providing statutory arrangements in relation to payments under construction contracts, including providing for interim payments. This will reduce the subcontractor&rsquo;s exposure to non-payment. The Bill also provides the means for subcontractors to enforce these rights; by suspending their labour and by introducing a new mechanism for the swift resolution of payment disputes through a process of adjudication. </p><p>  The Bill applies to contracts with an overall value &euro;10,000 or more. It is important to understand that the amount that is subject to a payment dispute can be lower than this. Therefore subcontractors will be free to refer payment disputes relating to lesser amounts to adjudication. For example if a contract with an overall value of &euro;11,000 gives rise to a payment dispute for &euro;1,000 this will come within the scope of the legislation. </p><p>  This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. This legislation is a priority for Government. In this regard, my officials are current working on the code of practice that will deliver a timely and cost effective adjudication procedure and to give effect to the legislation. </p></reply>

Some sites are open all year, and some are open for part of the year, mainly for the spring and summer seasons. The OPW has a number of visitor sites that have free access but do not have a guided presence and consequently, visitor numbers are not recorded at these sites. An example of such a site would be St. Stephen's Green. Similarly, visitors to some of our guided sites are only recorded if they enter the visitor centre of that site. For example, Glendalough monastic site may be accessed freely, without entering the visitor centre. </p><p>  Visitor numbers at guided sites, centrally recorded on the basis of returns submitted from individual heritage sites, are categorised under a number of headings and are then collated on a weekly and monthly basis, culminating in an overall annual figure. A comparison of the provisional 2013 visitor numbers up to the end of September, against the corresponding 2012 figures shows an increase in visitor numbers in the more well known sites such as Kilmainham Gaol, the Rock of Cashel, Kilkenny Castle, Clonmacnoise, Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and the National Botanic Gardens, with some notable increases in some of the OPW's lesser known sites such as Altamount Gardens, Glebe House and Gallery, Maynooth Castle, Ennis Friary, Emo Court, Casino Mario, Loughcrew, Desmond Hall, Roscrea Heritage, Listowel Castle and Scattery Island. These increases come on the back of an increase of almost 11% in visitor numbers between 2011 and 2012 in respect of all of our visitor sites. The monitoring of visitors to the OPW's heritage sites plays, and will continue to play, an important part in the development of policies and strategies relating to the heritage sector. </p><p>  Generally speaking, no specific promotion is required in respect of our most notable sites; visitors continue to be attracted in large numbers to such sites. One of the many challenges that faces the OPW is to entice such visitors to travel on to our lesser known sites, and indeed to increase overall visitor numbers at these sites, thereby spreading the benefits of tourism right across the country. In late July/early August, the OPW undertook a national advertising and flyer distribution campaign to coincide with the roll out of our Facebook Heritage Ireland page; this was complimentary to the ongoing promotion of our sites. The OPW will continue in its efforts to attract more and more visitors to our heritage sites, in line with government policy, that the heritage tourism sector will be one of the main growth areas in the future economic development of this country.</p></reply>

While savings have accrued due to the transfer of certain functions and pay reductions across the group, these are offset due to the significant start-up costs of the shared services and the transfer of maintenance service costs to OPW.</p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, together with the Shared Services and Office of Government Procurement functions, continues to deliver key outputs set out in the Public Service Reform Plan which was published in November 2011. This investment in the Government's reform agenda will yield longer term cost savings and facilitate service continuity in a smaller and leaner Public Service. When these centres are fully operational, annual savings targets are estimated as follows:</p><p>- Office of Government Procurement -   <font color="#2F2F2F">The procurement reform programme is targeting up to &euro;500m of much needed savings for tax payers over the next 3 years.</font></p><p>  - Peoplepoint (transactional HR) - &euro;12.5m</p><p>  - Payroll Shared Services (transactional payroll and pension services) - &euro;5.6m</p><p>  My Department has also collaborated with the Department of Finance to achieve administrative efficiencies within our shared facilities, particularly in the accommodation footprint.</p></reply>

When all of these options, including cost considerations, have been fully considered, the matter will be presented to Government for consideration and decision as to the most efficient and effective means for Ireland to participate in the Court.  This process is running in parallel with intergovernmental level negotiations among the contracting parties that signed the UPC Agreement in February of this year.  </p><p>  Under this intergovernmental framework, a number of working groups have been set up to establish the working methods and modalities of the Court including issues such as the legal Rules of Procedure of the Court, budget and financing of the Court, IT systems as well as the training and remuneration of Judges to be appointed to the Court.  This involves a very significant agenda of work which will better inform Ireland&rsquo;s options as to our participation in the Court.  </p><p>  Therefore, the timing of the referendum will, in the first instance, be predicated on the pace of progress made in the intergovernmental negotiations during 2014.  It will then be a matter for Government to decide on the precise date of any referendum and of course, this may also be influenced by the extent to which there are other issues or aspects of the Constitution that require a decision of the people.</p></reply>

As of 21<sup>st</sup> October 2013, 8 staff are employed by MFI.  Total salary costs in MFI may amount to not more than &euro;500,000 in any 12 month period.  As Social Finance Foundation (SFF) is the only shareholder in MFI, MFI does not pay fees for oversight, administration or management to SFF<font color="#004080">.</font></p><p>  Annual administration costs for MFI for the year to December 2013 are forecast to total approximately &euro;900,000.  Salaries are the largest component of MFI's annual budget.  In the first full year of operations which encompass all the establishment costs the ratio of loans to administration is 2:1.  This is to be expected in a difficult start up environment and MFI expects to improve on this indicator as awareness and demand increase.  The key ratio MFI is targeting is operating costs per job created/sustained.  At the end of the first full year this is &euro;3,420 per job.  This measure does not take account of cost avoided by the exchequer or exchequer receipts that may accrue as a result of each job.  MFI expects to drive down this indicator over time as awareness and demand increases.</p><p>  On foot of the Programme for Government my Department developed the Microfinance proposal, in close consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the European Investment Bank, and more detailed discussions with practitioners already in the area of Microfinancing.  A detailed analysis of other alternative delivery mechanisms was undertaken, such as: First Step, Multiple Lending Funds, Enterprise Ireland/County Enterprise Boards and Credit Unions.  Following this analysis, it was agreed by Government that there was no alternative model which could achieve the scale of lending and containment of credit risk required to fulfil the Commitment in the Programme for Government.  As set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis published in April 2012, a single lender would (i) minimise overall management costs which are traditionally high with microenterprises, (ii) ensure a clear financial and management information reporting structure, (iii) enhance the possibility for EIF assistance and (iv) allow for a clear identification of the costs involved in operating the scheme.</p><p>  As of 18<sup>th</sup> October 2013 MFI has approved 109 applications to the value of &euro;1.674m supporting 107 microenterprises and 237 jobs.  My Department publishes quarterly progress reports on the Microenterprise Loan Fund on my Department's website <i>www.enterprise.gov.ie</i>.  The progress report detailing the analysis and performance for the quarterly period ending 30 June 2013 is available on my Department's website.  I intend to publish the next progress report to end 30 September 2013 shortly.  The report is currently being finalised.</p></reply>

This allocation will ensure that my Department and its agencies will continue to deliver comprehensive programmes of activity and supports in respect of the three programme areas of jobs and enterprise; innovation; and regulation, at a further reduced cost to the taxpayer.  It will also help to ensure that the Government maintains its adherence to the EU/IMF Consolidation Programme and return the public finances to a sound footing.</p><p>  In line with commitments under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, my Department and its Agencies will deliver over &euro;13 million in efficiency savings in respect of 2014.  This significant level of savings comes in addition to savings that are being delivered under the Haddington Road Agreement, as well as various items of expenditure no longer included in my Department's Estimate in 2014, such as costs associated with Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  These savings will be delivered at the Departmental level through administrative efficiency measures and changes to business processes.  Further savings will also be delivered by the Agencies under the aegis of my Department through administrative and operational efficiencies, rationalisation measures and reprioritisation of spending in respect of a number of projects.</p><p>  The 2014 funding provision will enable the Department and agencies to provide continued supports for the full range of vital job measures that have proved instrumental in turning around the jobs market and getting growth into the economy over the past two years, such as:<blockquote>Delivery of measures under Action Plan for Jobs 2014. <br /><br />IDA will target approximately 12,000 new jobs in 2014 whilst maintaining supports to its client base which currently employs over 260,000 people in Ireland. <br /><br />Enterprise Ireland will target 12,000 new jobs and generate &euro;17.5billion in exports. The Agency will also support 95 new High Potential Start-Up companies with commitments to create 2,100 new jobs.</blockquote>  Over &euro;300 million in research and innovation funding supports through Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, the Higher Education Authority, Tyndall National Institute and Ireland's participation in the European Space Agency.  These supports will leverage well in excess of &euro;100 million in research funding to Ireland from non-exchequer sources next year from the likes of the EU and industry partners.  An additional &euro;3.5 million in supports for business start-ups and entrepreneurial supports by Enterprise Ireland through the County Enterprise Boards/Local Enterprise Offices network in 2014.</p><p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the provision in the 2014 Expenditure Report, enhanced by any additional provision accruing from the carryover of capital savings in 2013, will ensure that the requisite supports are in place in my Department to continue the work in turning around the jobs market and returning growth to the economy.</p></reply>

There are currently over 82,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.</p><p>  New revised rent limits came into force on Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits were determined following an extensive review of the private rental market which showed rising rents for urban centres, particularly Dublin and Galway and reduction in rents for the majority of counties.  The new limits continue to ensure that value for money is achieved while, at the same time, people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  The purpose of rent limits is to provide adequate access to accommodation for rent supplement tenants, while paying a minimum contribution.  Where rent limits have fallen, this is due to the local rental market's supply and demand conditions which set the local pricing levels of rental property in the respective area.</p><p>  Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement and ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Accordingly it is not proposed to conduct a poverty impact assessment.</p></reply>

The procedures governing the registration of deaths are provided for under Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004.  When a death occurs it is registered on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner.  Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner's certificate. These are the only circumstances under which a death can be registered.  While acknowledging that the loss of an unborn child is very sad for the family concerned it would not be practical or feasible to establish and maintain a register of deaths in such cases.</p></reply>

However, against this backdrop, my department will spend &euro;19 billion on social protection measures next year.</p><p>  People with disabilities are a priority for my department and in relation to the points made in the pre-Budget submission to which the Deputy refers, I would point out that core weekly social welfare payments for people with disabilities have been maintained for 2014 (except in the case of some 2,000 Invalidity Pension recipients aged 65 whose weekly rate is being adjusted to take account of the abolition of the State Pension Transition), the fuel allowance season remains unchanged for 2014, and the respite care grant remains unchanged for 2014.</p><p>  My Department also provides a wide range of income and work related supports (previously operated by F&Aacute;S) for people with disabilities.  These include the EmployAbility Service (formerly the Supported Employment Programme) which facilitates the integration of people with disabilities into paid employment in the open labour market and a number of employment supports aimed at employers for e.g., the Wage Subsidy Scheme &ndash; which pays an employer a subsidy for employing a person with a disability; the Work Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Employee Retention Grant and the Disability Awareness Support Scheme. Community Employment (CE) schemes are also available to people with disabilities.</p><p>  In relation to specific activation measures for people with disabilities, I would point out that I launched the Disability Activation Project at the end of 2012.  This is co-funded with the EU and is providing over &euro; 7 million to 14 projects (which will run until early 2015 across the BMW region to address 4 specific strands around the employment of people with disabilities: (i) Improving Access to Employment. (ii) Progression Programmes for Young People. (iii) Support for Progression and Retention of People with an Acquired Disability. (iv) Innovative Employer Initiatives.</p><p>  I am confident that these projects listed will provide significant guidance and learning on how best to ensure that people with disabilities are assisted to enabled and  participate fully in the labour market.  The outcomes of these projects will be crucial in determining the optimum approaches that should be taken in mainstreaming activation measures generally for people with disabilities. In the meantime, whilst priority is currently being given to unemployed people on the Live Register in terms of the INTREO service, it is open to any person with a disability to apply to avail of the service.</p></reply>

Since June 2012 employers can post jobs via the employer section of the Department of Social Protection's website (). This is also accessible using the  url.</p><p>  As part of its on-going assessment of customer service the Department conducts a twice yearly survey of employer satisfaction with the Jobs Ireland web service. The most recent survey for the six months to the end of June 2013 indicates a high level of satisfaction with an average score of 3.9 on a scale of 1 - 5 where 1 is poor satisfaction and 5 is very high satisfaction.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding this relatively positive feedback the Department is conscious that the website was developed some time ago and compares somewhat unfavourably with more modern websites including those used by peer organisations in other countries.  Accordingly the Department is currently engaged in a project to evaluate the current Jobs Ireland service and identify the changes need to be made in order to provide a more sophisticated online service for employers and jobseekers. </p><p>  I expect this process to lead to a redevelopment of the site in the coming year.</p></reply>

They also receive free travel.</p><p>  This year the Department will spend over &euro;182 million on the free electricity/gas allowance for over 410,000 customers.  In addition, some 410,000 customers will also receive the fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week for the winter months (26 weeks) from October to April, at a cost of &euro;223 million.  I was very happy to be in a position to preserve the value of the fuel allowance and the electricity/gas allowance in last week's Budget.  However, I am not in a position to extend the fuel allowance to carers at this time.</p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer's allowance as well.  The half-rate carer's allowance was protected in Budget 2014.  </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer's allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.</p></reply>

The terms of reference for this group are to review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee. </p><p>  The Department held a stakeholders' consultation forum in relation to the Guarantee on October 14, and has also invited further submissions from the bodies that attended.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has also requested the assistance of the OECD in developing the implantation plan.  In particular the OECD has been asked to identify best international practice and how it might best be applied to implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Ireland.  A delegation from the OECD has already met with stakeholders at the forum mentioned above as well as with a range of relevant public bodies. </p><p>  The development of the plan will also draw on expert work already carried out by the European Commission over the last few years, and in particular the Commission Staff Working Document (SWD) Accompanying the Proposal for a Council Recommendation on Establishing a Youth Guarantee, published in December 2012.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee for consideration by the Government in December before being transmitted to the European Commission by the end of 2013.</p></reply>

The Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure on the jobseeker's schemes of &euro;3.66 billion in 2013.</p><p>  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for 4 in any period of 7 consecutive days.  Where a person takes up employment the part-time job incentive scheme may, subject to scheme criteria, support them in making such a transition to employment.  The scheme allows persons who are long-term unemployed to take up part-time employment for less than 24 hours per week and receive a weekly income supplement.  Participants in this scheme are expected to continue to make efforts to find full-time work.</p><p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  This is an important policy issue for the Department but any changes to the current criteria could have significant cost implications. </p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has already reported to me on a number of important policy areas, is now looking at the whole area of atypical work and I look forward to their recommendations on this issue later this year.</p></reply>

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. </p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will then increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.</p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.  State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.</p><p>  Public sector workers who are obliged to retire at age 65 will be able to draw their occupational public sector pension at age 65.  The changes regarding State pension will have no impact on such public sector workers who are on modified social insurance.  However, for those public sector workers who are fully insured and in defined benefit pension schemes, their occupational public sector pensions (and contributions) are, like many occupational pension schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension.</p><p>  Where this does not happen, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public sector pension scheme to bridge the gap.  In such cases, a supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is therefore necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension.  This situation is not new and already applies to public sector workers who have a retirement age below 65.</p><p>  For other workers, the main social welfare payments available to those who leave employment before pension age are jobseekers benefit and job seekers allowance.  Persons who qualify for a job seekers payment who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age.</p></reply>

In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, 12.5 per cent came from work with over 50 per cent coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers, indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age. </p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65, all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  Each application for any social welfare scheme is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history.  Where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions including a means test.</p><p>  Further consideration is being given to the position of those exiting the workforce before pension age.</p></reply>

There are currently over 82,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.  The amendment to regulations in 2011 did not make any change to the entitlement conditions for rent supplement.  Statutory Instrument No. 462 of 2011 revoked provisions which are contained in section 198(3F) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended.</p><p>  In order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement.  A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</p><p>  In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by a housing authority.  Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.  However, where a claimant's safety and wellbeing are at risk due to domestic violence Department officials operating the rent supplement scheme have discretionary powers to expedite the award of a payment to the person in question.</p><p>  Policy in relation to eligibility for social housing and housing needs assessment is a matter for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the household benefits package, including the telephone allowance.  While we have cut the telephone allowance, there have been no cuts to the electricity/gas allowance, free travel, the free television licence, the fuel allowance or the living alone increase. </p><p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year and the number of eligible customers has increased very significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance, today there are almost 400,000, an increase of 24%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.</p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephone services were more expensive and fewer people had telephones.  In recent years the nature of the telephone market has been transformed with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.  There is a wide variety of deals and great competition now available. </p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has responsibility for the Seniors Alert Scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The grant assistance is made available through community and voluntary groups registered with the Department and the equipment supplied under the scheme remains the property of the community group.  The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.</p><p>  While the equipment currently provided requires the use of a landline, there are other companies in the market providing similar services based on mobile technology.  </p><p>  Finally, if any person is in particular difficulty an application may be made for an exceptional needs payments (ENP) under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by a Department based on the particular circumstances of the case.</p></reply>

Such rates in respect of younger jobseekers were first introduced in 2009.</p><p>  By extending the &euro;100 jobseeker's allowance rate to ages 22, 23 and 24 the changes provide that claimants in this age bracket will be &euro;60 better off if they engage in education or training such as the back to education programme as they will then receive &euro;160 per week.  Persons aged 25, had previously been subject to no financial incentive measure, will now receive &euro;144 per week.  These individuals will generally be &euro;16 better off if they engage in education or training as they will now receive &euro;160 per week. </p><p>  Similarly, interns participating on JobBridge receive an allowance of &euro;50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement for the period of their internship.  Arrangements provide that a claim for jobseeker's allowance is linked to any claim made within the previous 12 months, so persons returning to jobseeker's allowance following a 6 or 9 month internship will revert to the appropriate rate applying before their internship.</p><p>  It is anticipated that the changes will affect 13,767 persons in 2014, rising to 31,577 persons per annum over time.</p><p>  This decision was made on foot of on-going consideration of unemployment and incentives policy by Government. In making such decisions it is standard practice for all appropriate advice to be considered.  The changes are not discriminatory but rather are targeted measures aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.</p><p>  In preparation for the forthcoming implementation of the Youth Guarantee, Budget 2014 contained an additional &euro;46 million to support a number of initiatives aimed at young people. These include:- reducing the threshold (in terms of duration of unemployment) for JobsPlus eligibility from 12 months &ndash; to 6 months or less &ndash; in the case of persons aged less than 25 years;- an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme;- ensuring that 1,000 places on the T&uacute;s scheme are targeted at young people;- developing a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job; and ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the successful Momentum programme that operated in 2013, with income support for participants being provided by my Department; and furthermore the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will invest in the region of &euro;2.5m next year in making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.</p><p>  These measures are in addition to the significant existing spend of approximately &euro;170m per annum on employment, training and further education programmes for young people.</p><p>  I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age.</p></reply>

This means that unearned income such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings will be liable to PRSI at 4% provided the person is a chargeable person in accordance with the Revenue definition.</p><p>  A chargeable person does not include a PAYE taxpayer (i) who does not have other income or (ii) who has an element of other insignificant income that is fully taxed through the Office of the Revenue Commissioners PAYE system (Revenue regard amounts not exceeding &euro;3,174 as insignificant).  Individuals with income exceeding &euro;3,174 must pay and file under Revenue's self-assessing system.  This income will be chargeable to PRSI at 4% (Class K).  This new PRSI charge will not give rise to any social insurance benefits.</p><p>  The financial institutions will not be involved in the collection of any PRSI liability.

Officials in the Department of Social protection are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The intention is, following the commencement of the relevant legislation, that the HAP testing phase would be initiated in the selected local authorities during 2014.</p><p>  Overall, HAP will provide a more integrated and streamlined service for persons and households seeking support from the State to meet long term housing costs and will provide local authorities greater flexibility to provide assistance to those in need of social housing.  The measure will secure better value for money for the Exchequer in ensuring that rental payments are conditional on adherence to improved accommodation standards.  One of the key benefits that HAP will bring is the removal of barriers for people currently in receipt of rent supplement in returning to employment which is consistent with the Governments commitments under the Pathways to Work programme.  The engagement of people in employment will ultimately bring about wider social benefits, both to the individual and their families and also to the economy.  The transfer of the long term recipients to the housing authorities will assist in returning rent supplement to its original purpose of providing short term support to those unemployed.</p></reply>

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  There are currently approximately 11,000 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement with &euro;41.8 million provided in 2013.</p><p>  Under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, lenders are obliged to put in place Arrears Support Units to deal with borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing short term mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender under this process.  Lenders must explore all options for repayment arrangements in order to determine which options are viable for each particular case.  These options include interest only arrangements and deferring payment of all or part of the instalment repayment for a period. </p><p>  The continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem or to provide sustainable solutions.  The Department has examined a number of cases which clearly show that the significant investment by the State in providing support under the mortgage interest supplement is not reflected in the customers' outstanding mortgages or encouraged the implementation of sustainable solutions.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the range of supports implemented by this Government, including the range of information and guidance resources available, are appropriate in assisting those facing mortgage difficulties following the discontinuance of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.</p></reply>

The report found that the scheme operated with minimal deadweight and displacement, exceptionally high rates of satisfaction, both from interns and host organisations, and comparatively high rates of exit into employment.  61.4% of interns move into employment within 5 months of completion of a JobBridge internship.  </p><p>  The independent evaluation found that of the interns actually in employment at the time of the survey, 56% were in employment with their host organisation and 44% were in employment with another organisation.  </p><p>  In order to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge scheme a variety of control measures and criteria are in place.  These are designed to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides an appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the intern.  The Department also conducts random monitoring visits to check compliance with over 3,400 monitoring visits to-date; 98% of these visits have been of a satisfactory nature.

The aims of the Voluntary Work Option are twofold, namely: i) to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseekers to the greatest extent  possible in their activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work; and ii) to inform jobseekers of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so.</p><p>  Examples of voluntary work in which jobseekers may engage include helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disability or assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations and local resident associations.

This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum, while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs;</p><p> - The third is a relocation final legal agreement.  This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready, or can be made ready, for use for domestic turf cutting. </p><p>  Turf cutters who sign and return the applicable legal agreement to my Department will also receive a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500. </p><p>  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because, for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation, the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to those sites will take time to finalise.  Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed, they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time.  If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site - for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues in relation to the purchase or lease of a site - my Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at that time.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the legal agreements as set out above are appropriate to the circumstances in these cases.</p><p>  It is the aim of my Department to secure a relocation site for every person who has applied for one and progress is being made in that task.  However, relocation is a complex process that does take some time to deliver.  The agreements being issued reflect this reality.  The interim agreement is designed to give all stakeholders the time to deliver relocation options that work for turf cutters.  The clear directions that I have given my officials is to examine all relocation options with a view to securing alternative cutting locations for as many turf cutters as possible within the shortest timeframe.</p><p>  1,635 legal agreements have been issued and my Department is continuing to issue agreements to qualifying applicants.  Applicants have been requested to return the completed legal agreements within four months of the date of issue.  1,123 legal agreements have been returned to my Department thus far.  The numbers of legal agreements by type issued by and returned to my Department are not available at this time.</p></reply>

The NSMC comprises Ministers of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government, working together to take forward co-operation between both parts of the island to mutual benefit.  Six North South Implementation Bodies have been established.  They operate under the overall policy direction of the NSMC, with clear accountability lines back to the Council and to the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p><p>  My Department, along with the Department of Culture, Arts, and Leisure in Northern Ireland, is particularly engaged in support for the NSMC in its Language and Waterways sectors, given our role in co-funding and supporting two North/South Implementation Bodies under our remit, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga, which comprises two agencies - Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency/Tha Boord o Ulst&egrave;r-Scotch.  My Department is fully committed to supporting North/South co-operation, particularly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  I, along with the Minister of State at my Department, Mr. Dinny McGinley, T.D., participate regularly in meetings of the NSMC, in both the Waterways and Language sectoral formats.  There have been four such meetings already during 2013 - three in Language sectoral format viz. 6 March, 19 June and 10 July and one in Inland Waterways on 19 June 2013 - each held in Armagh.  A further two sectoral meetings are planned for November.  The Council issues a Joint Communiqu&eacute; following sectoral meetings.

The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative </i>- was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources.  The initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts.  The arts got a boost of over &euro;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse.  A full list of awards under this scheme can be viewed on my Department's website at .</p><p>  This year, &euro;210,000 is available to arts organisations under the Initiative.  The terms are as follows:</p><p> - Up to &euro;5,000 of funds can be accessed through the scheme if the organisation can match each &euro;1 from the taxpayer with &euro;2 from private sector sources;</p><p> - Up to &euro;10,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;3 from private sector funding;</p><p> - Up to &euro;15,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;4 from private sector funding.</p><p>  In 2013, priority was given to arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  This is to support the <i>Arts in Education Charter,</i> which I launched in conjunction with Mr Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills.  Accordingly, the Initiative, while continuing to provide an incentive to arts organisations to engage in fundraising, will also encourage arts and culture organisations to engage creatively with children and young people and add to their education.  In doing so, they will be helping to foster the artists and the audiences of the future.</p><p>  I should mention also that in October 2012 I hosted and chaired a forum on <i>Philanthropy and the Arts </i>in Smock Alley Theatre.  It featured speakers from key philanthropic organisations and the arts in Ireland.  The conference was very well attended and generated very positive feedback.  There is a full report of the conference on my Department's website.</p><p>  Parallel to these initiatives, the Arts Council is undertaking an initiative - <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity </i> - which dovetails with the work in my Department.  The initiative consists of a programme which is providing one-to-one professional support to selected arts organisations for two years to assist in planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme for each organisation.  Eight leading Irish arts organisations are aiming to raise &euro;10 million in private funding over the next five years as part of this Arts Council initiative.  </p><p>  My Department has also provided support to Business to Arts (a not-for-profit organisation working to support resilience and transformation in the cultural sector through research, innovation and partnership) for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland (The Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment in this project is &euro;400k over three years).</p></reply>

The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in one of the relocation sites from the 2014 turf cutting season.</p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 7 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of a small group of 3 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon to Togher, County Roscommon, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that this group of qualifying turf cutters will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites.  Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.</p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure/drainage works required, establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.  In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 70 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department.  Bord na M&oacute;na has also commenced negotiations with landowners in relation to the purchase or long-term lease of sites.</p><p>  There are 2 raised bog special areas of conservation in County Kildare affected by the cessation of turf cutting - Ballynafagh Bog and Mouds Bog.  58 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Ballynafagh Bog and 106 applications have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Mouds Bog.  28 and 40 of these groups of applicants, respectively, have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.  61 payments and 12 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Ballynafagh Bog and 105 payments and 65 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Mouds Bog.</p><p>  Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare has been identified as a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog.  Bord na M&oacute;na had produced a preliminary suitability assessment report and stratigraphy assessment report for the relocation site.  It has now undertaken a full suitability assessment for the site and my Department has provided a copy of the assessment report to the Secretary of the Committee of the Kildare Turf Cutters Association.</p><p>  There are also 2 natural heritage area raised bogs in County Kildare designated under national law in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Acts - Carbury Bog and Hodgestown Bog.  In May 2010, the previous Government decided that turf cutting should come to an end on all raised bog natural heritage areas at the end of 2013.  However, as set out in the Programme for Government, the current Government undertook to review the situation with regard to raised bog natural heritage areas.</p><p>  This review is currently underway and the future of turf cutting on such sites is being considered as part of that review.  It is my intention that the review will provide clarity for turf cutters and landowners in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season and my Department will be contacting individual landowners and turf cutters on these sites in due course.</p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. </p><p>  Following the D&aacute;il motion of 7 March 2012, which called on the Government to &#8220;engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency&#8221;, I secured the agreement of the European Commissioner for the Environment for the development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, in keeping with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke.  The approach of the national plan may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, in regard to the most difficult of sites, where relocation options are limited.</p><p>  To progress the preparation of the plan, my Department engaged a team of specialists (RPS) to provide the scientific basis for raised bog conservation in Ireland.  RPS has been working with my Department and the Peatlands Council to prepare a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, a draft of which I hope to make available for consultation before the end of the year.  Further information on the work of RPS can be found at .</p><p>  The clear majority of domestic turf-cutters on the raised bog special areas of conservation are now engaging with my Department in finding acceptable solutions within the law.  The door is still open for others to engage in this process with me, my Department and with other stakeholders to address the needs of turf cutters and other interested parties.  Such engagement would, I am sure, help to address the needs of turf cutters more speedily.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels, throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including funding decisions. In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of over &euro;60.6 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding.  Details of all funding provided by the Arts Council to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues, including arts centres, are available on the Council's website at .  In a wider context, the Arts Council support of a range of arts forms is set out in its strategic overview document entitled <i>Developing the Arts in Ireland: Arts Council Strategic Overview 2011-2013</i>.  In this strategy document, which is available on the Council's website, its work and key strategic principles that inform its funding decisions are laid out.</p><p>  I have outlined previously for the Deputy a range of ways in which my Department and relevant bodies within its remit are supporting cultural and heritage initiatives in conjunction with local groups and communities. These include the following cultural tourism initiatives that have been wholly or partly funded by my Department:</p><p> - St. Patrick's Day celebrations;</p><p> - Music Day;</p><p> - Culture Night;</p><p> - Arts Council support of the Arts Festivals and Events scheme, which supports some 150 small arts festivals in towns and villages throughout Ireland each year;</p><p> - Arts Council funding of arts centres and venues around the State, as well as the Council's funding of touring and dissemination of high-quality work in all disciplines through the national network of arts centres and venues;</p><p> - The Arts Council partnership with local authorities and Art Officers throughout the country;</p><p> - Funding of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann by my Department to support its work in the promotion of Irish traditional music;</p><p> - Cultural and heritage events being held under the auspices of The Gathering;</p><p> - Web-based projects being developed by my Department to promote greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland's heritage for residents and visitors alike;</p><p> - Collaborative work with bodies and groups such as the Arts Council, the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and Music Network.</p><p>My Department also operates a philanthropic initiative for arts and culture organisations. </p><p>  I would also refer the Deputy to my previous replies in relation to these matters. In January last, I provided details of the number of applications received for grant-aid and other forms of support from applicants from County Kildare and the extent to which these applications were approved. My Department's website will be updated with details of grant-aid to organisations after the year end.</p></reply>

My Department also works on a range of issues across the area of built heritage, arts and culture and the natural heritage with public agencies in Northern Ireland where opportunities for co-operation arise.</p><p>  My Department provides core funding for the Heritage Council, which supports a range of initiatives involving co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland, including National Heritage Week, the Irish Walled Towns Network and the Museum Standards Programme of Ireland.  I understand that this year Heritage Week included events from Counties Antrim and Down and that the Irish Walled Towns Network includes, as a founder member, Derry City, which this year celebrates the 400th anniversary of the laying out of the ground on which Derry&rsquo;s walls were built.  The Museum Standards Programme of Ireland, which sets out to raise standards of curatorship across Irish museums and galleries, includes, as one of its participants, the Museum of Free Derry.  Many of the museums in the programme also participate in cross border initiatives under their own auspices, such as Donegal County Museum, Cavan County Museum and Monaghan Museum.  In addition, I understand that Heritage Officers in border counties, who are part-funded by the Heritage Council, are involved in on-going co-operation and collaboration with their colleagues in Northern Ireland on heritage issues.</p><p>  In September of this year, I hosted a seminar which was designed to gauge the interest of local authorities and community groups in pursuing full nomination of World Heritage Status for the sites on Ireland&rsquo;s current Tentative List and to clarify all the elements involved in applying for and retaining such status. The seminar was attended by representatives of Armagh District Council in connection with the possibility of including Eamhain Mhacha/Navan Fort in the Royal Sites of Ireland nomination (currently comprised of Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, the Hill of Uisneach, and the Rathcroghan and Tara Complexes).  The promotion and marketing of the island of Ireland as a tourist designation is primarily a matter for Tourism Ireland, which, as all-island body, works in strategic partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and with other industry partners to expand Ireland&rsquo;s valuable tourism market and to highlight the unique qualities of Ireland&rsquo;s national heritage abroad.</p></reply>

Cost effective harnessing of the potential of this sector will be crucial to reducing our dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports, creating a low carbon energy system and delivering jobs in the green economy.  My Department is currently finalising an Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP). Informed by the findings of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), the OREDP will identify how best to coordinate action across the environmental, energy and economic development policy areas in order to realise Ireland's abundant offshore renewable energy potential, using both offshore wind, and emerging ocean, renewable technologies.</p><p>  In addition, my Department is working closely with the United Kingdom Government to pursue the opportunity of harnessing the renewable energy resources for export. Renewable energy export holds the prospect for significant job creation in the future, both in the building and maintenance of generation installations and the manufacture of components in Ireland. All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, will have to co-ordinate their activities early in the process to ensure we maximise the employment potential of export projects. This opportunity has already been identified by the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.</p></reply>

I am advised that TDI is a renowned and widely respected professional consultancy company with a global presence. TDI have been commissioned internationally by such clients as the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank, the World Tourism Organisation, the Irish American Cultural Institute and a range of multinational companies. Government Departments and Agencies from EU Member States and from countries worldwide have also engaged TDI for expert advice and analysis.  In Ireland, TDI has carried out work for the Marine Institute, Failte Ireland, Udaras na Gaeltacht as well as a host of Local Authorities and regional organisations. In the Northern Ireland and cross border context its clients include Waterways Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the Loughs Agency.</p><p>  The principal results of the professional and wide-ranging study of Ireland&rsquo;s recreational angling sector, which was published in July 2013, estimate that recreational angling in Ireland contributes &euro;755 million to the Irish economy and supports in excess of 10,000 jobs in peripheral and rural areas.  I am advised that the results in this report are based on sound economic principles and have been peer reviewed before publication.  IFI have confirmed that the Deputy is correct that 19,899 salmon licenses were sold in 2011. However, it is important to be cognisant of the specific question asked in the published survey, as well as the incidence of targeting multiple species.</p><p>  At no point does this study reference a specific monetary value for any individual species. I understand that there has been comment attributed to a UK based website on the published study.  IFI advise that having examined the figures put forward in that comment, it appears that the estimated maximum participation values for one species were erroneously mixed and inappropriately extrapolated with average spend figures for all species which unfortunately underpin a complete misunderstanding of the study&rsquo;s findings.  I have arranged for a copy of the study to be provided to the Deputy to afford him an opportunity to review it fully and would be happy to arrange a full briefing with IFI personnel.</p></reply>

Direct Exchequer funding for IFI was reduced by &euro;2.582 million in 2010 compared to 2009 which is mainly attributable to savings arising from the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector. It is not possible to fully disaggregate on an item by item basis the savings which have arisen from the merger of the former regional boards; however it is clear that significant administrative savings have been made.</p><p>The establishment of IFI has facilitated more efficient and effective management of the inland fisheries resource. In addition, it has brought to bear a national perspective to formulating policy which is more streamlined, coherent and integrated. There is also a single allocation of funding to the organisation on a national basis. IFI are also employing new technologies, such as covert CCTV cameras, use of kayaks to conduct silent patrols along rivers and access areas which previously would have been difficult to get into unnoticed, in order to significantly augment coverage and increase time spent by officers on surveillance techniques which are more resource efficient to assist in the detection of illegal activities.</p><p>The Exchequer funding drawn down by IFI from my Department for 2010 (the year of IFI's establishment), 2011 and 2012 is as follows: 2010 - &euro;26.479 million; 2011 &ndash; &euro;24.971 million; 2012 &ndash; &euro;25.448 million.  The funding allocated and available for draw down in 2013 is &euro;28.062 million (including once off capital allocation of &euro;3m).  Overall, as compared with the position prior to the establishment of IFI, Exchequer funding from 2009 to 2013 has reduced by &euro;1.012 million (&euro;4.012 million if the once capital allocation of &euro;3 million in 2013 is excluded). The 2013 once-off additional capital allocation of &euro;3 million was ring-fenced for the procurement of a new Headquarters for IFI as part of a planned property rationalisation as the organisation seeks, in line with Government Policy, to exit from expensive leases. This rationalisation strategy will generate efficiencies and also savings over time in relation to lease costs and in terms of significantly better energy efficiency of the new HQ.</p><p>The table below details money spent on research, pay, pension, current activities and capital expenditure. It should be noted that Exchequer allocations do not fully cover IFI's costs and the shortfall is made up from IFI&rsquo;s own resources which mainly comes from licence, permit and contract income.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Actual Expenditure Incurred</b></th><th><b>Jan - Dec 2011 &euro;000's</b></th><th><b>Jan - Dec 2012 &euro;000's</b></th><th><b>Jan - Sept 2013 &euro;000's</b></th></tr><tr><td>Pay net of social welfare receipts</td><td>16,923 </td><td>16,722 </td><td>12,164 </td></tr><tr><td>Pensions (including gratuities) net of Superannuation and Spouses &amp;amp; Children receipts from staff</td><td>2,055 </td><td>2,359 </td><td>1,327 </td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Subtotal of pay costs</i></b></td><td><b><i>18,978 </i></b></td><td><b><i>19,081 </i></b></td><td><b><i>13,491 </i></b></td></tr><tr><td>Current Activities net of pay and pensions excluding Research</td><td>8,865 </td><td>9,166 </td><td>6,003 </td></tr><tr><td>Research current activities net of pay and pensions</td><td>1,168 </td><td>1,183 </td><td>787 </td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditure</td><td>1,160 </td><td>770 </td><td>1,928 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Expenditure</b></td><td><b>30,172 </b></td><td><b>30,200 </b></td><td><b>22,210 </b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Expenditure cuts of &euro;1.6 billion were central to this adjustment and difficult decisions were required across all Departmental budgets. By its very nature, this process involved detailed and ongoing consideration at Departmental and Ministerial level of the range of potential expenditure reductions, some of which were only mooted shortly before settling of the Budget by Government.  As part of this process, a decision was taken by Government on the proposal of the Department of Social Protection to reduce by &euro;5m the amount required to be paid to my Department by the Department of Social Protection for free television licences. This measure will result in RT&Eacute;'s licence fee income being cut by over &euro;4.6m from the start of 2014, as well as a reduction of around &euro;350,000 in the amount available to the independent production sector through the BAI's Sound &amp;amp; Vision Fund.</p><p>  The BAI's Five Year Review of the Funding of the Public Service Broadcasters (PSBs) was published in July of this year and made a number of recommendations in relation to the future funding of the PSBs. It is my intention that the recommendations made in this Review will serve as the basis for future decisions on the funding of the PSBs.  RT&Eacute; continues to make considerable efforts to achieve its target of breaking even at the end of this year and I am informed that RT&Eacute; remains on course to achieve this outcome. While the prevailing challenging financial circumstances and this reduction in its licence fee revenue may have an impact on the provision of some RT&Eacute; services next year, I am hopeful that RT&Eacute; can continue to protect and promote its core public service output in 2014.</p><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 415 and 417 together.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no function in the matter.

I am pleased to confirm that my Department's 2014 homeless budget will be maintained at the same level as 2013 - &euro;45 million.  While this amount represents a decrease of 3.32% on the 2012 outturn, homelessness funding from my Department has been substantially protected over the past number of years despite the wide-scale pressure for reductions in Government spending across all Departments. </p><p>  Earlier in 2013, I published the Government's <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i> in which I outlined the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  When I published the statement, I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland, and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.  I also established a high-level three-person oversight group for the purpose of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions.  The group expects to provide me with its first report shortly.   </p><p>  Arrangements have been put in place to provide for the delegation of homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions.  The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.  These arrangements place an emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, to improve overall efficiency and value for money, and allow greater local decision making in homeless services.  They also seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach advocated in the policy statement, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016, and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators. </p><p>  My Department is currently engaging with a number of lead housing authorities and is considering the appropriate allocation of the 2014 homeless budget so as to ensure that Section 10 homeless funding contributes to meeting the needs in the various regions.</p></reply>

Works carried out under the water conservation programme can involve the replacement of lead water distribution mains.  In addition, in 2011, my Department clarified certain matters for local authorities in relation to the National Water Conservation Programme.  In particular, the category of works for which Departmental funding is available was extended to cover the removal of common backyard services, which can often involve lead piping.   </p><p>  The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the water metering programme.

As a first step in this process, the Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, conforming to the conditions set out in the Act and registered under the Companies Acts.</p><p>  The Act provides that Irish Water will be required to submit an annual report on the performance of its functions each year to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Irish Water will also be required to submit its annual accounts to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government each year.  The 2013 Act also provides that the annual report and accounts will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The extension of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act to include Irish Water is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   </p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is has put in place appropriate programme management arrangements to establish Irish Water, provide for customer service and billing and the domestic water metering programme in line the overall implementation strategy.  Expenditure on this programme is a matter for Bord G&aacute;is/Irish Water and these costs are not being funded from the Exchequer.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has provided a bridging loan facility to Irish Water to meet the costs arising to the end of 2013.  This includes the initial stages of the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. </p><p>  A key objective of the reform programme is to rationalise the cost of the current service delivery and ensure more efficient operation of water services by moving from 34 water services authorities to a single body; following enactment of comprehensive legislation later this year, these functions will transfer to Irish Water.  The comprehensive legislation will provide powers to the Commission for Energy Regulation to examine and approve the costs of the services provided by Irish Water.  The Commission is also to be provided with a statutory role to set standards of performance to be met by Irish Water and to, inter alia, promote the continuity, security, quality and sustainability of the services provided by Irish Water.  The Commission will be required to operate in an open and transparent manner and to carry out appropriate consultations with customers and stakeholders where appropriate as part of this process. </p><p>  Following transfer of the water services functions to Irish Water from 1 January 2014, a new funding model will be place to meet both capital and operational costs.  Irish Water's costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance (such as the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, EIB, bank lending and capital markets facilities) and State support which may be in the form of both equity and subvention.   </p><p>  As it has been decided, following the previous review of the Memorandum of Understanding by the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, that domestic water charges will commence with effect from Quarter 4 2014, it is expected that Irish Water will issue the first bills to customers in Quarter 1 2015.  The Commission will engage in the necessary public consultations commencing in early 2014 on the design and level of domestic tariffs, based on the expected costs of Irish Water from 2015 onwards. </p><p>  The Exchequer proposes a direct equity investment of &euro;240m towards the capital funding of Irish Water in 2014.  This will support projects to be included in Irish Water's Capital Investment Plan and will ensure that the entity is in a position to take on the water services investment programmes of the 34 water services authorities, including some 80 projects currently in progress.  Irish Water will also finance some of its costs and the liabilities transferred from local authorities through borrowings in 2014.   </p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing from 2014.  Work is also underway on the funding model for Irish Water's operational costs, to ensure that Irish Water can fund the Service Level Agreements being put in place with local authorities for the delivery of water services in 2014.</p></reply>

However, legal difficulties arose during the drafting process and it was not possible to proceed on the basis intended.  My Department and I have worked over the past few months to resolve these difficulties and put in place an alternative means of funding a pyrite remediation scheme.  In this context, I am very pleased, despite the necessary constraints on public expenditure at this time, to have secured Exchequer funding to support the implementation of a pyrite remediation scheme under the auspices of the Pyrite Resolution Board.  In addition, a revised general scheme of a Bill to establish the Pyrite Resolution Board on a statutory basis has also been approved by Government.  Drafting of this legislation is a priority I have to have it published and enacted in this D&aacute;il term. </p><p>  The revised funding arrangements which have now been approved by Government will mean that the necessity for the more complex structures for the delivery of the pyrite remediation scheme as envisaged in the previous funding arrangements, which involved the establishment of a not-for-profit company, are no longer required.  The Pyrite Resolution Board, with support from the Housing Agency, will now implement the programme in line with the scheme which has already been outlined on the Board's website <i>.  </i>The Board have already made significant progress on developing appropriate systems and procedures.  They will now quickly advance work on the proposed online application and processing system and also finalise work on developing other complementary systems, with appropriate checks and balances, to ensure that effective and efficient programmes of remediation are delivered to affected homeowners.   </p><p>  The initial phase of the remediation programme will deal with approximately 1,000 dwellings which, it is estimated, are in need of immediate repair. Initially, &euro;10 million is being made available to my Department and additional funding will be provided over the next two years, in the context of the capital stimulus programme to be announced in early 2014, to deal with all dwellings deemed by the Pyrite Resolution Board to be in need of remediation. </p><p>  I continue to attach a high priority to putting in place the necessary structures to deliver a resolution to the pyrite issue for affected homeowners who have been waiting a considerable period of time for solutions.  I would like to assure affected homeowners that there will be no undue delay on my part or on that of my Department and the Pyrite Resolution Board to ensure that the pyrite remediation scheme is delivered in the shortest possible timeframe.</p></reply>

Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in this regard.  My Department has issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank's Code of Conduct, which continue the tradition of handling arrears in a manner sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p><p>In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment options, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case.  These include, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent.  Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices.  The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.</p><p>The most up-to-date data held by my Department covers the second quarter of 2013, and indicates that there were 20,277 live housing loans on the books of the local authorities.  Of these, 6,275 were in arrears over 90 days or more, 1, 307 were over 90 days in arrears but not yet over 180 days in arrears, with the balance of 4,968 being over 180 days in arrears.

In 2010 and 2012 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, reflecting the Central Bank's Codes of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  These have facilitated local authorities in providing a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty, by means of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which includes a suite of short term and long terms options depending on the circumstances of the borrower.  It is anticipated that this initiative will allow a proportion of distressed mortgagees to restructure their repayment schedules and thereby alleviate the current pressures being felt.</p><p>Notwithstanding the flexibility shown by local authorities in dealing with borrowers in difficulty, it is inevitable that a proportion of individuals will find themselves with loans which are unsustainable in the long term, and, in these circumstances, a borrower may opt for a voluntary surrender of the property.  In other cases, and increasingly where occupiers have abandoned the property, it may be necessary to regain ownership by means of legal action. In all circumstances, local authorities explore every option to avoid repossessions, and it is very much the last resort.</p><p>Data on local authority mortgage repossessions broken down by local authority is provided in the following table for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake re mediation works where necessary.  Since 1998 , the Building Regulations require all new buildings to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction.  In October 2004 an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) was published incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005.

The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.</p><p>  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.  The financial parameters within which we will continue to operate rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.</p><p>  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.  In addition Budget 2014 provides for the allocation of a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will also continue to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing; other funding mechanisms to increase the supply of permanent new social housing will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  In spite of the current challenging circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2014.</p></reply>

This included a construction programme which is currently underway for 185 local authority houses and 111 houses for special needs accommodation for the voluntary sector.  The 3-year construction programme is on-going at present and is expected be completed by end 2014.  The funding also provided for the acquisition of built properties with some 246 units to be delivered through the local authorities and a further 266 units to be acquired by Approved Housing Bodies (AHB's) and funded under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS).</p><p>  Earlier in 2012 I announced separate capital allocations to city and county councils which included some &euro;59 million for the local authority housing construction and acquisitions programme and a further &euro; 4 6 million for the provision of accommodation by AHB's.  It is not possible to disaggregate the numbers of housing units delivered under each of the two allocations announced in 2012.  Data in relation to the overall numbers of local authority housing units delivered, including completion figures for local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing programmes funded by my Department, are available on my Department's website,   It is expected that the recently announced &euro;30 million additional investment in social housing will deliver 500 homes for families on the housing waiting list.</p></reply>

The term "trafficks" is broadly defined in the 2008 Act.  For example, the commission of a trafficking offence does not require cross-border - or even internal movement - or illegal entry into the State.  It includes recruitment; taking a person into one's custody, care or charge; and providing the person with accommodation or employment.  However, the term "forced labour" was not defined in the 2008 Act.</p><p>  In the context of a review of the potential of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2008 to combat forced labour conducted in my Department last year, the report published on the dedicated anti-human trafficking web site, blueblindfold.gov.ie in January 2013, recommended that, in the interest of clarity, the term "forced labour" should be defined in legislation in line with the definition in the ILO Convention No. 29 of 1930 concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour. Subject to certain specified exceptions, the ILO convention defines forced labour as "all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the person has not offered himself voluntarily".  </p><p>  As the deputy will be aware, I availed of the opportunity afforded by the  Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2013 to clarify the definition of forced labour in these terms.  The ILO definition is the international standard, and the new legislation now enacted ensures that there can be no doubt as to our fully complying with that standard and our having in place rigorous criminal law sanctions applicable to all of those who engage in human trafficking for forced labour.</p><p>  It is important to note that forced labour covers a diverse array of exploitative behaviours ranging from infringement of labour regulations, at one end of the spectrum, to human trafficking, etc., at the other.  Consequently, it is likely that activities constituting forced labour could also be prosecuted under a number of other offences, for example, false imprisonment, blackmail, assault, the coercion offence under the Non-fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, offences under employment law and health and safety legislation, immigration law, etc.</p></reply>

Section 36 of the Defamation Act 2009, makes a minimum provision in that regard.  It removes the possibility of prison sentences and private prosecutions for blasphemous libel.  It also provides for a defence to a defendant who proves that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value in the matter to which the offence relates.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to consider the question of a referendum on blasphemy and in that regard, I can confirm that one of the matters to be considered by the Constitutional Convention is a proposal to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.</p></reply>

The position in the State of the person concerned is unchanged since then.</p><p>  The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant.  Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 27th February, 2009, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making written representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p><p>  The person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case.  Her judicial review leave application was refused by the High Court   on 11th April, 2013 meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the then Minister stood.  The person concerned has submitted an application for subsidiary protection.  However, this application could not be determined while the judicial review proceedings were in place.  When consideration of the subsidiary protection application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p><p>  In the event that the application for subsidiary protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

Protocols are in place between the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI which provide for the implementation of a programme of Personnel Exchanges and Secondments between the two forces. To date eighty nine members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and seventy six members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland have taken part in exchange programmes between the forces and one Garda Superintendent has been on secondment with the PSNI.</p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (Police Service of Northern Ireland Appointments) Regulations 2012 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (Section 52) Regulations 2012, allow for appointment of members of the PSNI to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the ranks of Superintendent, Chief Superintendent and Assistant Commissioner. I understand from the Minister for Justice in Northern Ireland that suitably qualified members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply for similar positions within the PSNI.</p><p>  The regulations referred to above specifically provide that the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland be notified of the holding of promotion competitions for the relevant ranks in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Expressions of interest from members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland were received for a promotion competition in 2012 and subsequently two briefing sessions were held at the Garda College Templemore, in September 2012. The appointments from this competition have been made and on this occasion did not include any members of the PSNI. The same notifications will be put in place when future promotion competitions are being held in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These formal arrangements are but one element of the ongoing very close co-operation that exists between the forces on a day to day operational basis across all aspects of policing.</p></reply>

The Board, which was established in 2001, makes recommendations to the Minister in relation to the management of offenders serving long sentences.  While it is open to the Parole Board to make any recommendation, the experience with the Parole Board is that life sentenced prisoners are normally reviewed on a number of occasions over a number of years before any substantial concessions are recommended.</p><p>It is important to note that a life sentence is indeterminate and there is no guaranteed release date.  However, it does not always mean life in prison.  Persons released into the community continue to serve their sentences, subject to conditions, while on release.  While in the community, life sentence prisoners are required to be under the supervision of the Probation Service.  The Probation Service provide Progress Reports to the Irish Prison Service outlining resettlement and reintegration progress and will report on any risk management concerns a prisoner may present.  Where it is reported to the Irish Prison Service that a life sentenced prisoner in the community is failing to abide by the conditions of their release, that person may be refused a further period of temporary release and be taken back into custody.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may return a prisoner to prison where the prisoner is in breach of their temporary release conditions.  The Governor of the prison must conduct a hearing during which the prisoner is afforded due process before a decision is made as to whether the temporary release should be revoked.</p></reply>

This funding was originally drawn from the National Lottery surplus but, as with other National Lottery funded subheads, it is now drawn also from exchequer funds.  Because of the urgent need to make savings in Government expenditure, this Scheme cannot be sustained in the current circumstances.  Beneficiaries were advised in October 2012 that it would be phased out on a gradual basis over a 3 year period, with the first reduction taking effect in late 2013. This is in order to give affected organisations as much time as possible to adjust to the change and to consider how they may increase the funding they receive through other fundraising projects.  As the decision to phase out the Scheme is currently the subject of legal proceedings initiated by The Rehab Group and Rehab Lotteries, I am not in a position to comment further in relation to this issue, at this time.</p></reply>

Briefly, those provisions require persons seeking to make an application to be interviewed by an immigration officer and informed, where possible in a language that the person understands, that they may apply to the Minister for a declaration of refugee status.  An interview by an immigration officer must, where necessary and possible, be conducted with the assistance of an interpreter and the immigration officer is required to keep a record of the interview and to provide a copy to the person concerned and to the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</p><p>  A person who makes an application for asylum must be granted permission to enter the State and is entitled to remain in the State until their application for a declaration is transferred to another Member State under the Dublin Regulation, withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn, granted or refused by the Minister.  As the Deputy may be aware, applications for refugee status are investigated at first instance by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).  Both the ORAC and the RAT are statutorily independent in the performance of their functions under the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).  In addition, it is open to applicants to seek leave to take a judicial review in relation to decisions of the ORAC and RAT.

This was done as part of the regular, ongoing interaction between my Department officials and the associations; specifically, the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women (ONE), the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA) and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO).  I understand that they in turn informed their respective memberships.  The associations did raise some concerns with my officials, including the timeframe for implementation of the move and the impact on banking and bill-paying transaction dates.  Insofar as the Department could, those concerns were taken on board.  No hardship cases have been brought to my Department&rsquo;s attention in relation to the move and there are no plans to extend phasing of the move beyond the six months already notified to pensioners.</p></reply>

Following engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the ceilings for expenditure within the Defence Sector were set out for the 2012-2014 period. These ceilings were based on a rigorous assessment of pay, non-pay and pension elements of the Defence Sector Votes (Defence and Army Pensions).</p><p>  The Current expenditure provision for the Defence Sector in 2014 is &euro;890m. This represents a reduction of &euro;2m on the 2013 CRE provision, after adjustments, and follows on from significant reductions achieved over previous years. These reductions were achieved through a series of measures, which included a stabilisation of the strength of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) at 9,500, a re-organisation of the Defence Forces into a two Brigade structure and a rationalisation and consolidation of my Department&rsquo;s property portfolio.  I have been assured by the Chief of Staff that despite reductions in funding, the Defence Forces continue to have the capability to deliver on all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

However, under certain limited circumstances it does provide such items for the purposes of data collection, animal identification and surveys.  For example, in bovine identification, keepers receive prepaid envelopes and prepaid white calf birth registration cards with their tag orders.  Freepost envelopes are also supplied to keepers who use Animal Events sheets to register their births.  All keepers who order tags are issued with these cards and envelopes.  There is no variation in practices across the different regions.</p><p>  Any error letters issued by the calf birth registration and movement agencies have a freepost envelope enclosed.  This also applies to all correction letters.  Similarly my Department provides prepaid envelopes to sheep flock owners and goat herd keepers with their annual sheep/goat census forms in order to encourage them to return their sheep/goat census forms which under national legislation they are obliged to do.  The provision of the envelopes has helped my Department maintain a very high annual response rate and it reduces the number of times officials issue reminders to submit a census.</p><p>  Prepaid envelopes are also issued annually to approximately 4,000 pig herd owners to facilitate return of the pig census form.  Running an annual pig census fulfils EU obligations and is a valuable resource for the Department, underpinning both identification and disease control systems.</p></reply>

This application was the subject of a Remote Sensing (i.e. Satellite Inspection). The results of this inspection indicated that over-claims existed on land parcels declared in the application. With a view to verifying the results of the Remote Sensing inspection a ground inspection of these parcels was arranged. The findings of the inspection confirmed that the total over-claim in respect of both the Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas Schemes was greater than 50%. In such circumstances, the penalty provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 is that no payment can issue for either Scheme in the year in question. </p><p>  In addition, in accordance with the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, a Multi-Annual Sanction fine equalling to the monetary equivalent of the area over-claim by the applicant must be deducted from payments under EU funded schemes due to the applicant over the following three years.</p><p>  The person named was informed of the over-claim by letter dated 18 October 2013. That letter also informed the applicant that she had a right to appeal. On receipt of any appeal the matter will be re-examined by my Department.</p></reply>

The purpose of this model is to achieve a gradual phased redistribution of payments between those who currently hold high value entitlements and those who hold low value entitlements.  It will I believe introduce a fairer more equitable distribution of funds between farmers while avoiding the negative impact of a sudden move to a &lsquo;flat-rate&rsquo;.  </p><p>  Farmers who currently hold low value entitlements will benefit from this process of convergence over the five years of the new scheme.  By 2019 all farmers must have an entitlement value which is at least 60% of the national average entitlement value.  In addition the new Regulation provides other options which allow for further reductions of high value payments.  These are currently under consideration.</p><p>  The CAP agreement reached on 26 June provides a number of options for Member States in terms of how they can tailor the new measures to their specific needs.  In this context I initiated a process of consultation with all stakeholders in July the responses to which are currently being collated.  I will decide on the final shape of the new Direct Payments system in Ireland later this year.</p></reply>

In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar/bioethanol facility in the country.  I understand from figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, that the overall capital cost costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed. </p><p>  I informed both groups at the time and many times since, that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  I also informed both groups that it was my job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.</p><p>  In this connection, I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that at the last Council of Agriculture Ministers in June, which I chaired under Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry.  I am glad to note this agreement has been welcomed by those who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.   </p></reply>

The Scheme aims to support the diversification of the economies of traditional fishing communities to help maintain people and jobs in these areas.  The Scheme is co-funded by the Exchequer and the European Fisheries Fund.  </p><p>  Six Fisheries Local Action Groups covering the entirety of the Irish coastline have been established as part of the Scheme.  The South-West FLAG covers the coastal zone of counties Cork and Kerry, extending from Youghal to the coastal border of Kerry and Limerick, just west of Foynes and extending 10 km inland from the coastline. </p><p>  The South-West FLAG was established on 14 March 2013.  It is governed by a board comprised of seafood industry, community and relevant state actors.  Its Local Development Strategy was adopted on 31 July 2013 and a first call for projects published on 9 September 2013.  Applications were assessed by the board, which made grant offers of approximately &euro;17,500 to three projects, two of which are being implemented in County Kerry.  These two projects supported capital investment by a seaweed processing company and a tourism related rowing venture. </p><p>  Total Expenditure to date for the South-West FLAG is approximately &euro;40,000 which included one-off establishment costs such as the Local Development Strategy.  </p></reply>

My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of bill before Government at the earliest possible date.  The constitutional and legal context within which the development of these legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex. </p><p>  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the Bill is to provide that either the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records. </p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis.  The purpose of the Register is to allow a person affected by adoption to enter his or her name on the Register with a view to receiving information about another person from whom he or she has been separated as a result of adoption and also to indicate a preference as to whether or not contact is being sought with that person.  </p><p>  A National Tracing Service will be established under the provisions of the Bill, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines to be set out in regulations.  It is intended that the Tracing Service is to be made available to an adopted person, a birth parent and a relative of either an adopted person or a birth parent, and that the Adoption Authority is to have overall responsibility for providing the tracing service.</p><p>  However I wish to advise that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill  and that detailed on-going consideration of these issues is under way in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General.  At this stage is it not certain that the problems that have arisen can be overcome by the introduction of legislation and further legal advice has been sought in an effort to see if  legislation that meets my policy objectives can be drafted within constitutional parameters.</p><p>  With regard to individual cases, information and tracing inquiries are normally dealt with by the organisation that arranged the original adoption placement.  If the adoption agency has closed, the Health Service Executive Adoption Information and Tracing Service, or the agency that now holds the placement records, will deal with the inquiry.  Queries in relation to the handling of a request for information and tracing should be addressed to the agency dealing with the request or the Adoption Authority as the body with responsibility for regulating accredited bodies who provide adoption services. </p><p>  A representative of the Adoption Rights Alliance attended a recent meeting which I held with an individual in relation to adoption information and tracing.  At this meeting I agreed to meet representatives of the Adoption Rights Alliance specifically to discuss the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I invited them to make a submission in this regard in advance of the meeting. </p></reply>

These savings are being achieved, to the greatest extent possible, through increased operating efficiencies and value for money to protect front line services.  I consider that my Department`s Budget allocation for 2014 will enable the delivery of a significant level of public services, as well a number of new policy measures which include:</p><p>- Additional funding to support the programme of reform for child welfare and protection services that will be implemented by the new Child and Family Agency which is due to be established in January 2014;</p><p>- Delivery of a Pre-School Quality Agenda which seeks to support high standards through supporting the efforts of providers and their staff in delivering improved and more reliable quality; and to respond to concerns raised by parents;</p><p>- Additional investment to address child poverty through the Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme - a joint initiative between my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies to improve outcomes for children in disadvantaged communities; and</p><p>- Additional funding to support youth organisations and services.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-22a.1173.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013102200059#WRY01400"><p>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme. This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution. </p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.  It negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process. This method of negotiation is necessary in order to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.  </p><p>  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p><p>- costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p><p>- price(s) previously charged,</p><p>- local market price, and</p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>  If price negotiations break down, a three stage review process can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.</p><p>  The services which fall within the scope of long-term residential care services, and which are covered by the cost agreed with the NTPF, are:</p><p>- nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,</p><p>- basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living,</p><p>- bed and board, and</p><p>- laundry service. </p><p>  In determining the services covered by the NHSS, it was considered very important that nursing home residents and taxpayers would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, goods and services that are already available to individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the goods and services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same items or service.</p><p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by the NHSS. In other words, a person can continue to receive goods and services in accordance with the terms of these other schemes regardless of whether they are in a private nursing home or elsewhere. </p><p>  It should be noted that certain items of expenditure, termed allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment of an applicant for the NHSS.  These include certain medical expenses. </p><p>  There have been no changes to the goods and services covered by the NHSS since it commenced. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. This review will consider the sustainability of the Scheme as well as looking at community based services.  It will also include an examination of the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices. It is envisaged that the review will be completed in early 2014.</p><p>  Finally, under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, the registered provider must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.</p><p>  The Health Act 2007 gives statutory responsibility to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority, for the independent inspection and registration of public and private nursing homes.  The Chief Inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with the Regulations or the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland</i> .</p></reply>

However, the Radiographers Registration Board has been established and is expected to open its register on 31 October 2013.</p><p>  In the absence of statutory registration, persons are free to work in the private health sector in Ireland without having their qualifications recognised.  However, persons wishing to work in the publicly-funded health sector in Ireland who have obtained their qualifications outside the State must apply to have their professional qualifications recognised under Directive 2005/36/EC.  Such qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the public health sector.   </p><p>  In the case of the health and social care professions, including radiography, the Directive provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the formal qualifications and professional experience of an applicant against the qualifications required to practise in the host member state, i.e. Ireland, and to offer the applicant a compensation measure should deficits in qualifications be identified.</p><p>  Under Statutory Instruments Nos. 139 and 166 of 2008, which transpose the Directive into Irish law, the Minister for Health is the Competent Authority for the assessment of radiography qualifications and is advised by the Irish Institute of Radiography and Radiation Therapy (IIRRT).  The National Validation Office, Health Service Executive, Galway administers the process on behalf of my Department.</p><p>  In the case of the applicant to whom the Deputy refers, the IIRRT carried out an assessment of her qualifications and, based on the information provided, deficits were identified.  She was therefore invited to submit further documentation to support her application.  This documentation is currently being examined by the IIRRT and it is expected that a decision will issue to her shortly from my Office.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p><p>   Improving access to outpatient services is a key priority for the Government.  Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU, together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the HSE, has developed the outpatient waiting list minimum dataset.  This allows data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan.  The SDU and the NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p><p>  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.  In relation to the specific hospital appointment query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Ireland is now well advanced in this work. </p><p>  In January 2011, EUROPLAN, the European Project for Rare Disease National Plan's Development, organised a national conference bringing together patients, patient organisations and healthcare professionals to discuss what might feed into the development of a national strategy for rare diseases. </p><p>  A National Consultation Day for stakeholders was held in Farmleigh in June 2012.

Community pharmacists are authorised to dispense a maximum of seven days supply of medicines prescribed for persons who have been in-patients in a hospital or who have attended an Emergency Department and because of the circumstances of their discharge and/or the urgency of the prescribed medication it would not be possible to attend their GP to have the hospital prescription transcribed to a GMS prescription form.  This arrangement relieves any difficulties that patients might encounter due to being discharged from hospital late in the evening or at weekends.</p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that it is best clinical practice that a person in need of treatment should regularly attend their GP and that the GP is fully aware of the medications that any patient may be being prescribed.  This is entirely consistent with the gatekeeper role played by the GP in the delivery of primary care.  As GPs receive an annual capitation fee per GMS patient there are no extra costs incurred by such patients.</p></reply>

In August I announced appointments to this Board to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January 2013.  These appointments bring architectural, planning, procurement, engineering and construction expertise and experience to the project.  Also in August, I announced the appointment of members to the Children's Hospital Group Board.  This Board will oversee the operational integration of the three existing paediatric hospitals in advance of the move to the new hospital and is also the client for the new hospital, and hence is critically important for the project as a whole.  Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman was selected as CEO of the Children's Hospital Group in September following an open recruitment process through the Public Appointments Service and is expected to take up post in November. </p><p>  Prior to the commencement of construction, key elements of the project include design development, decant works for the site and planning permission.  The procurement process for the new design team was initiated in July.  Following its appointment, the new Board reviewed that procurement process and have decided on a change of approach based on its collective expertise and experience and taking into account changing market conditions.  While this change means that the design team will be selected in Spring 2014, rather than by the end of this year as originally planned, the new Board is confident that there will be no delay to the project overall, as time can now be recovered at contractor tender stage.  In tandem, a review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is almost complete; the number and location of these satellite centres in the Dublin area is a key decision, as the size, activity and infrastructure of these satellite centre(s) has implications for the main hospital brief. Pre-application planning discussions have commenced while St. James's Hospital is working closely with HSE Estates and the National Paediatric Development Board in regard to the decant phase of the project. </p><p>  Work by the new Board on developing a detailed project timeline is continuing, which will reflect the urgency and priority of the project and also its scale and complexity.

The VFM Review found that HSE funding is based on an incremental determination process with relevant adjustments made to the previous year's baseline allocation.  In recent years, the funding of new places has been made at local level on the basis of providing services to named individuals, but, once allocated, the funding does not remain associated with or follow that individual but is absorbed into the agency's base.  </p><p>  The move towards a model of funding which is linked to individual need, and which by definition will follow that individual, is encompassed by the recommendations in the VFM Review.  It is intended that the actions recommended in the VFM Review will lay the groundwork for individualised budgeting once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure its long-term viability.  The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from a person-centred supports model and developing the administrative and governance infrastructure necessary for a more accountable and individualised service. </p><p>  With regard to the individual query raised by the Deputy, as it relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. </p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act, inter alia, provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants occasioned by their disability to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  </p><p>  There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years in respect of the children now encompassed by the process.  The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources. </p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.  </p><p>  In addition, targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally. </p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.  Officials from my Department are currently engaging with the HSE and the NDA to further consider the findings contained in this Report.  </p></reply>

The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding has been set out in the HSE National Service Plan, which I approved in January.  </p><p>  The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  This policy requires the health service to reduce its workforce to 98,938 wholetime equivalent employees by the end of 2013.  However, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.</p><p>  With regard to the HSE's Speech and Language Therapy Service, I understand that each individual that presents to the Service has an initial assessment to determine their individual need for therapy.  The therapist, in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer, will determine the severity of the individual's difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinic policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment. </p><p>  The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  Along with the significant investment in area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches have been developed and used in many Speech and Language Therapy services across the country.  These include providing structures, training and support to parents /carers so that they can work to help improve the individual's speech and language.  In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings where appropriate.  The HSE has stated that it is committed to working in partnership with other service providers to achieve maximum benefits for children and adults with speech and language therapy requirements, and aims to ensure that, the speech and language therapy resources available are used in the most effective manner possible. </p></reply>

Since the programme commenced in 1995, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants. Beaumont Hospital carried out ninety cochlear implants in 2012 (42 children and 48 adults). The routine practice in Ireland, so far, has been to implant one side only. </p><p>  It is now considered best practice worldwide that children should have the option of bilateral implants, and this is reflected in the recommendation of the report of the National Review of Audiology Services which was carried out by the HSE in 2009. The aim of that Review was to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. Its report was published by the HSE in 2011 and provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services. The Report recommended continued ring-fenced support for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. </p><p>  The HSE has developed a proposal, in liaison with Beaumont Hospital, to introduce a bilateral cochlear implant programme in Ireland. In doing so, the HSE has engaged with many stakeholders. Introduction of bilateral cochlear implantation is expected to involve additional staff, equipment and capital works. The resources required will be considered in the context of the Health Estimate for 2014, announced on 15 October last, and the development of the HSE's National Service Plan 2014. </p></reply>

The standard approach to the treatment of Lyme Disease is to follow the guidance laid out in the <i>Infectious Diseases Society of America</i> guidelines on the clinical assessment, treatment and prevention of Lyme Disease.  This is accepted as being the most up to date synthesis of best available evidence on the clinical management of Lyme Disease and treatment of Lyme Disease is based upon this guidance.</p><p>  The acute tertiary hospitals in Ireland have the diagnostic and treatment facilities and personnel for the management of Lyme Disease.  In addition, a network of infectious disease specialists is available in all the major centres to provide consultative, expert advice in the management of Lyme borreliosis.  I have been advised by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre that there were eight cases of Lyme Neuroborreliosis notified in 2012.  Lyme Neuroborreliosis is at the more severe end of the spectrum of Lyme borreliosis and as such it is possible that there may be more people with the milder form of the disease.  Given the numbers of cases of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, I am confident that the facilities available for the diagnosis and treatment of the condition are commensurate with the burden which the disease imposes.</p><p>  The diagnosis of a case of Lyme Disease can be difficult.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial screening step.  However, screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific and can give other false-positive reactions in the presence of various other infections from syphilis to glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second stage immunoblot test.  The use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach gives a greater degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease.</p></reply>

The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and assisting in the performance management of hospitals to reduce waiting times. The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account. Any funding to support the SDU performance improvement programmes is now part of the HSE Vote, and this is reflected in the level of NTPF funding.</p><p>  The NTPF allocation for 2013 was &euro;13.987 million, of which just under &euro;10million was allocated to meet liabilities arising from treatments carried out during 2012. The provision in the Estimates for Public Services 2014 reflects the fact that it is not envisaged that there will be any significant level of such liabilities in 2014.</p></reply>

As of end September, the recruitment process is complete for 378 or 91% of the 414 posts approved in 2012 and 255 or 54% of the posts approved in 2013 were in the final stages of the recruitment process and a further 149 were at earlier stages, indicating that 85% of posts are in the recruitment process.  The HSE's National Recruitment Service is currently working to ensure that the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, from existing panels or through competition in the absence of panels, at the earliest opportunity. Options to enable more local recruitment are also being considered where this will assist in filling specific posts.  I have received assurances from the HSE that the recruitment process for these new posts is being given priority within the HSE.</p><p>  In Budget 2014, the Government has again re-committed to the continuation of the development of this critical service in these extremely challenging times, where the options for additional expenditure generally are very constrained.  &euro;20 million is being ringfenced for the further development of our mental health services in 2014 which will enable the HSE to continue to develop and modernise our mental health services in line with the recommendations of<i> A Vision for Change </i>  and will allow for the recruitment of additional staff to further enhance our-</p><p>-  Adult Community Mental Health Teams</p><p>-  Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams</p><p>-  Specialist Mental Health Teams</p><p>  In addition, this funding will facilitate the recruitment of additional Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention and the implementation of national suicide prevention initiatives.</p><p>  This &euro;20m means that, despite serious resource pressures overall, funding of &euro;90m has been made available since 2012 up to end of 2014, which has been specifically ear-marked for mental health and suicide prevention.</p><p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure.</p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014 when the specifics of the legislation are known.</p><p>  It became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition, as outlined initially in the Programme for Government, was likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation and detailed regulations would be required in order to provide a GP service to persons on the basis of their having a particular illness. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. Funding allocated for the extension of a GP service without fees to people with particular medical conditions has been used to mitigate the supplementary budget requirement of the HSE and support existing levels of service.</p><p>  Following the recent announcement to commence the roll out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees, I will engage with all relevant stake-holders, as appropriate, in relation to implementation and administrative arrangements.</p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to healthcare for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.</p></reply>

However, as was announced in Budget 2014, it has become necessary to increase the prescription charge due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment which requires the Government to achieve additional savings in health expenditure with &euro;666 million of savings targeted in 2014. The increase in prescription charges will account for &euro;43 million of this target. The Government is committed to achieving these savings while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>  Medical card holders will be required to pay a &euro;2.50 charge per item for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists, subject to a cap of  &euro;25 per month for each person or family. Prescription charges do not apply to children in the care of the HSE or to methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme. These new rates will be effective from 1 December 2013.</p><p>  Compliance with medication is a matter for the patient in conjunction with their medical practitioner.

This will be fully extended to HSE West by the end of the year. The objectives of this programme are:</p><p>  - To offer a hearing screen to newborn babies using an agreed national protocol;</p><p>  - To screen babies using the agreed national protocol for screening within 4 weeks of birth, and by 44 weeks gestational age for babies who have been in a Special Care Baby Unit or Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for more than 48 hours;</p><p>  - To ensure timely referral and assessment to integrated audiology services of babies identified as requiring assessment;</p><p>  - To ensure that all babies with permanent childhood hearing impairment receive effective and acceptable intervention, care and support that meets their individual needs, including appropriate referral to other services such as ENT and allied health professionals and other statutory bodies/agencies such as Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  Additionally, if a baby passes the screening but if the parents have concerns at a later stage, they can highlight these concerns to their Public Health Nurse or Area Medical Officer and be referred into Audiology Services for re-assessment.</p><p>  The HSE chairs a Collaborative Working Group which has representation from DeafHear, HSE Audiology Services, HSE Speech and Language Therapy Services, Visiting Teachers for the Deaf and the Beaumont Cochlear Implant Programme. This group works closely to ensure that services provided to children diagnosed with a hearing impairment are offered in a seamless fashion. Once an audiologist diagnoses a child with a hearing impairment, they refer on to the appropriate professionals.</p><p>  UNHS has proven high sensitivity and specificity. With this sensitive procedure for hearing screening, a child with a permanent hearing impairment (PCHI) can now be identified much earlier, within 4 to 5 weeks of birth, and the hearing status of each ear determined accurately. This means a child can start receiving appropriate support within the first six months of life. The core objectives of UNHS are described as &quot;1-3-6&quot; goals which are based on international programmes:</p><p>  - Babies to be screened by 1 month of age;</p><p>  - Audiology assessment completed by 3 months of age;</p><p>  - Initiation of appropriate medical and audiological services, and early intervention services, by 6 months of age.</p></reply>

The Audiology Clinical Care Programme has recently developed a waiting list and validation procedure to be implemented regionally. The first data set is due in by the end of this month. Ten recently graduated HSE funded MSc Audiologists are also due to join the workforce this month. This increase in staffing, along with the new National/Assistant National Lead posts, will increase audiology staff by over 30% in community services and substantially increase activity, thereby reducing waiting times.</p><p>  Additionally, each HSE region is engaging in waiting list initiatives. A programme of streamlining current working practices, care pathways and introducing new technologies will further lead to reduced waiting times for patients. A programme is being piloted whereby Area Medical Officers and Public Health Nurses, who would have carried out the Infant Distraction Hearing Test prior to the introduction of universal newborn hearing screening, will carry out screening on children who have a fluctuating hearing loss due to ear infections. With careful monitoring, these children will now not need to be placed on audiology waiting lists.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded from this additional funding is also a matter for the local authority.    </p><p>  The Local Improvements Scheme provided funding for the maintenance and improvement of private roadways which are, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner. </p><p>  As I'm sure the Deputy is aware, State grants available to supplement expenditure by local authorities on the maintenance of regional and local roads have been reduced significantly and further cuts are scheduled for 2014. The scale of the cuts have necessitated that some grant programmes be curtailed or ended.</p><p>  In making adjustments to the regional and local roads allocations the primary aim has been, as far as is possible, to protect previous investment in the road network and use the  available funding to maintain and restore public roads, including those in rural areas.  Notwithstanding that, I have given local authorities the option in 2013 to use up to 7% of their Discretionary Grant on private roads if they so wish and I anticipate that this will continue into 2014. Indeed, I am open to increasing that level increased in 2014 if there is such a desire from the local authorities themselves. However I do not believe that it would be appropriate to have a separate allocation for the Local Improvement Scheme as there are divergent views amongst local authorities and local authority members as to the merits of the scheme and whether it is more appropriate that those funds be spent on public roads. Therefore, I favour giving that discretion to local authority members.</p><p>  Kerry County Council were allocated &euro;2.6 million under this grant category in 2013. Obviously, these works are entirely at the discretion of the Council. It should be remembered that individual local authorities are the responsible road authority and must prioritise works in their own area.</p></reply>

The cut in the budget for the Irish Sports Council for 2014 currently stands at around &euro;3.1m but I hope to be able to alleviate that somewhat through adjustments in the Vote of my own Department. However I will have to see the details of the Council's proposals before doing so. Given the very limited resources available to me, I need to be satisfied that any funding I can reallocate from other uses will deliver a very substantial additional benefit for sport.    </p><p>  I would point out to the Deputy that the total Sports budget will go up from &euro;74.6m to &euro;93.5m, which is a substantial increase of over 25%. This increase will enable us to launch another round of the Sports Capital Programme and commence work on the long outstanding Indoor Arena at the National Sports Campus. This is welcome news for community sports clubs across the country and will increase participation in sports. Clubs will be able to apply for essential works like new changing rooms, pitches, lighting and other projects for the second time since this Government took office. It will also mean that we will be able to fund regional projects as happened with the last programme. </p><p>  This increased funding for sports comes at a time when there are many calls on limited Government resources and demonstrates the Government's commitment to sport and its understanding of its value both to the economy and the health of the nation.</p></reply>

The 2013 RTP allocation is &euro;9.633 million which includes a one-off &euro;500k to support the restructuring of the Programme announced by me on 9 July 2013. Therefore, the underlying decrease in RTP funding in 2014 over 2013 is in line with the Comprehensive Expenditure Review reductions for Exchequer funded public transport services.</p><p>  The figure of 0.9m in the Expenditure Report 2014 under the heading &lsquo;Others&rsquo;, is used to capture all the proposed savings under &euro;1m &ndash; and the amount is a balancing figure &ndash; with the RTP given as an example rather than representing the full amount.</p><p>  The purpose of the restructuring of the RTP is to protect the provision of rural transport services into the future. The new model for the delivery of rural transport services involving the establishment of 18 Transport Co-ordination Units in place of the existing 35 RTP Groups, will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs, thereby ensuring that the resources available are dedicated to the greatest extent possible to the provision of transport services to those in rural communities who need them.

This represents a 5% reduction on the 2013 allocation.     </p><p>  The &euro;75m reduction set out in the 2014 Expenditure Report is the full year impact of cuts on the current expenditure side of my Department's Vote. This is in line with commitments made under the Comprehensive Expenditure Review. As set out in the Expenditure Report, the cuts are spread across a number of my Department&rsquo;s programmes, including the subventions to Regional Airports, public transport PSO contracts, regional and local roads maintenance programmes among others. The cuts will naturally impact on the prioritisation of funding under the relevant spending programmes. The precise distribution and implications of these cuts will be confirmed in Revised Estimates later in the year.</p></reply>
