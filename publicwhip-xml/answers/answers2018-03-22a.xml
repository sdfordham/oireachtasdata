    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-22a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032200036#WRA00500"><p>Ireland has been allocated &euro;1.2 billion (in current prices) in Structural Funds for the period 2014 - 2020,  which involves the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). This is comprised of: </p>  <p>  - &euro;411 million for the two ERDF co-funded Regional Programmes, under the aegis of my Department, and delivered through the Southern Regional Assembly and the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.</p>  <p>  - &euro;169 million for European Territorial Co-operation programmes; the PEACE Programme, the Ireland/Northern-Ireland/Scotland Programme, the Ireland/Wales Programme; and the Northern Periphery and Arctic, North West Europe and Atlantic Area trans-national programmes. </p>  <p>  - &euro;545 million for ESF co-funded programmes, and an additional &euro;68 million provided for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) which is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills.  </p>  <p>  It is an EU regulatory requirement of the 2014 - 2020 round of Structural Fund that each Member State implements an ICT system, "e Cohesion", to control and monitor expenditure.  The original procurement exercise in 2016 for such a system was unsuccessful, due to insufficient effective and genuine competition and due to the fact that the only valid bid was significantly in excess of the Budget set for the solution. </p>  <p>  It was agreed with the EU Commission - specifically in order to safeguard Ireland's structural fund allocation - that the ICT system in use for the 2007 - 2013 round of funding, with minimal modifications, could be used for initial claims.  This was on the understanding that the more comprehensive e Cohesion system was being developed. </p>  <p>  The agreed "Contingency ICT System" went live in May 2017. It has been successfully used for claims by ERDF and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). </p>  <p>  Following a second, successful procurement a contract for e Cohesion was signed in April 2017.  Phase One went live on 25 August 2017, Phase Two on 1 December 2017  and the final Phase is expected to be live before the end of March.  The new e Cohesion system has already been successfully used by the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD) for a claim in December 2017. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question on drawdown I would like to reassure him that we have not lost any EU funding.  He will be aware that most programmes are funded up front by the Exchequer and EU funding is claimed in arrears, as set out in the respective regulations. </p>  <p>  In relation to ERDF receipts, my Department have claimed &euro;32.2m to date, in addition to &euro;23.5m we have been paid in advances.  Furthermore, it expects to claim in the region of &euro;75m by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  In respect of the ESF and YEI, the EU Regulations allow for the  2014/2015 allocations to be claimed by the end of 2018.  Preparations are underway by the Department of Education and Skills for the submission of a first payment application to the Commission in Q3 of 2018.  The ESF authorities will ensure that sufficient payment applications are submitted to fully drawdown  &euro;127.7m by the end 2018 deadline. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the European Territorial Co-operation Programmes, including the north/south programmes, are subject to separate administrative arrangements on a cross border basis and are not covered by e Cohesion. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-22a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032200036#WRA00800"><p>The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the Office of Public Works (OPW) Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  The CFRAM Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, designated in 2012 as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  The flood risk for each of these areas has been assessed, through detailed engineering techniques to assess their risk and impact from flooding.  This risk and the proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified to manage that risk are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  Inchigeelagh and Ballingeary are AFA&rsquo;s and are being assessed by the South Western CFRAM Study. </p>  <p>  Proposed measures has been identified for the areas in question, namely to progress the project level development and assessment of a Flood Relief Scheme, consisting of flood walls and embankments, including environmental assessment as necessary and further public consultation, for refinement and preparation for planning / exhibition and, if and as appropriate, implementation.</p>  <p>  In summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an independent review of the environmental assessments.  Having now received the outcomes of the independent review of the environmental assessments for the Flood Risk Management Plans, the Commissioners of Public Works are submitting the Flood Risk Management Plans to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for approval. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan 2018-2027 commits to almost &euro;1 billion in funding for flood relief schemes, with annual Capital funding for the OPW doubling to &euro;100m by 2021.  This funding will support continued investment in schemes at construction and design.  Once the Plans are approved, I intend to announce a prioritised initial tranche of schemes proposed by the Plans to progress to detailed project level assessment and that provide greatest return for Government investment. </p></reply>

I do not have a role in respect of applications or proposals for individual projects at county level.</p>  <p>  The ten-year National Development Plan (NDP) has been put in place to underpin the implementation of the National Planning Framework (NPF) to support the development of all counties and regions, both urban and rural areas.</p>  <p>  The NDP sets out an investment programme of &euro;116 billion, aligned to the ten National Strategic Outcomes (NSOs) detailed in the NPF which are critical to long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability in the period to 2040.  Investment in urban and rural regeneration and development, drawing on two new Funds with total resources of &euro;3 billion established for this purpose have the potential to have a transformative impact on both urban and rural areas and communities countrywide.</p>  <p>  Total funding of &euro;8.8 billion is allocated to the NSO of strengthened rural economies and communities which is a cornerstone of NDP, including in relation to the delivery of the National Broadband Plan and significant investment in regional and local roads.  The NDP also contains, as a priority, increased investment in public transport including train fleets. </p>  <p>  Chapter 5 of the NDP details as a fundamental objective of the Plan the investment planned in enhancing regional growth potential through an integrated programme of measures including, for example, regional sectoral clustering and the promotion of entrepreneurship on a regional basis.  The Plan also highlights the importance of strengthening Ireland's international connectivity through continued investment in ports and airports, including under the Regional Airports Programme.  It sets out the major programme of investment planned in the heritage area including in national parks and nature reserves.  Continued investment over the ten years of the Plan to ensure the sustainable management of water resources is a further investment priority which is clearly relevant to all regions and counties.  Finally the Plan sets out the investments planned in the areas of quality childcare, education and health services which are a defining characteristic of attractive, successful and competitive places.</p>  <p>  Under the NPF, and as set out in section 6.3 of the NDP, the three Regional Assemblies are now responsible for co-ordinating, promoting and supporting the strategic planning and sustainable development of their regions, consistent with the objectives of the NPF, through the preparation of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES).  The RSES for the Eastern and Midland Region provides the opportunity for the priorities for County Kildare, for example, that are included in the existing Kildare County Development Plan, to focus on sustainable growth, quality of life and on achievable employment and population growth within Kildare and the Eastern and Midland Region to be integrated into a regional investment plan which is expected to be a major driver of the implementation of the NPF.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-22a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032200036#WRA01600"><p>As I indicated in response to Priority PQ No 13699/18 from Deputy Calleary earlier, the Government agreed in December, that the compulsory retirement age of public servants recruited before 1 April 2004 would be increased to age 70.  This is the only group of public servants who currently have a compulsory retirement age of less than 70.  The decision arose on foot of a review of the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce carried out by my Department with public service employers, last year.</p>  <p>  Primary legislation will be required for the changes approved by Government to be implemented.  The Government has approved the General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to its decision and I have asked the Attorney General to prioritise the drafting of this legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible. The drafting process is currently underway and an initial draft of the Bill is being prepared.  The Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer Session 2018.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to determine the length of time it will take for a Bill to be drafted and pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas, given the need for meticulous drafting, ongoing detailed policy considerations, and the scheduling requirements of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill is, however, being treated as a priority and my intention is to bring forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  In order to make some accommodation for public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government Decision on 5 December and the commencement of the necessary legislation, the Government approved some limited interim arrangements which became effective from the date of the Government Decision.  The interim arrangements allow affected public servants who reach the age of 65 in that period, to remain in employment until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory), which is currently 66.  Details of these interim implementation arrangements have been put in place by the relevant sectors.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-22a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032200036#WRA01900"><p>Public Procurement is governed by EU legislation and National rules and guidelines.  The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for developing and setting out the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland.  In this regard, the OGP has developed the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which consists of 5 strands:</p>  <p>  - Legislation (Directives, Regulations)</p>  <p>  - Government Policy (Circulars, etc.)</p>  <p>  - Capital Works Management Framework for Public Works</p>  <p>  - General Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services</p>  <p>  - More detailed technical  guidelines, template documentation and information notes as issued periodically by the OGP</p>  <p>  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procurement procedures to be followed by public bodies.  The framework supports contracting authorities, including the OGP, the four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, when awarding contracts for works, goods and services.  It enables public bodies to adopt procedures to meet their Public Procurement requirements and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules.</p>  <p>  I should point out that Local Authorities like all Contracting Authorities are responsible for adhering to the procurement policy framework and for the individual procurement decisions they make.  In terms of adopting a consistent approach to public procurement,  I understand that the Local Government Management Agency provides advice and assistance to Local Authorities regarding national and EU procurement regulations and contract management issues affecting their activities and monitors legislative and case law developments to ensure its processes remain current in light of these developments and other best practice initiatives. </p>  <p>  I would add that, last July, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules. </p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting that while the OGP guidelines facilitate and enable compliance with public procurement rules, it is the responsibility of each Contracting Authority, including the Local Authority Sector, to ensure they adhere to these rules.</p>  <p>  The OGP supports compliance by putting in place compliant procurement solutions, publishing guidelines and template documentation and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive.  The solutions provided by the OGP include a broad range of Framework Agreements from which public bodies can draw down goods or service, and include areas as diverse as uniforms, food, legal services, IT, and electricity.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the OGP's Key Account Managers are in regular contact with Procurement Officers in Government Departments and State Bodies to assist, support and remind them of their obligations in relation to public procurement.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, and the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and Accountable Officers/Accountable Persons are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred. Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement. </p></reply>

In accordance with international best practice, PPP contracts already typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to protect the public interest and ensure that the project proceeds to completion.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of such PPP contracts, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium&rsquo;s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State.  Liquidation of a company involved in delivering a public infrastructure project is an unfortunate and unforeseen development but would impact on any project where a supplier became insolvent during the delivery process, regardless of whether the project was being procured by PPP or by traditional means.  The issue, therefore, is not PPP-specific, but where it arises in a PPP project, the provisions of the PPP contract ensure that the public interest is protected. </p>  <p>  It is worth bearing in mind that this is not the first time a PPP in Ireland has experienced issues with its construction contractor, which is not uncommon given the risks inherent in the construction market.  In all previous similar cases, the projects were completed successfully and are now fully operational.  These examples demonstrate the resilience of the PPP contractual structure and underline the importance of adhering to the contractual documentation in resolving issues - which has previously been raised as a negative feature associated with PPPs.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the NDFA, who are procuring this PPP project on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, that in accordance with international best practice, this PPP contract includes detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member to ensure that the project proceeds on a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; basis with minimal disruption. </p>  <p>  Given the advanced state of these schools (approximately 90% completed) the NDFA does not envisage material disruption or delay to the works.  However the NDFA is actively monitoring the position in the context of the robust contractual protections provided for under the PPP contract. The NDFA are making every effort to ensure delivery of the schools in as timely a manner as possible. </p>  <p>  PPPs continue to provide benefits to the State as a procurement method which enables the public sector to harness the innovation, commercial and management expertise and efficiencies of the private sector to design, build, finance, operate and maintain State facilities with a specified residual life on handback.  PPPs will also continue to be a procurement method available to the State for appropriately structured projects where they demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option.</p>  <p>  While the liquidation referred to in the Deputy's question will give rise to a delay in completing the remaining construction works on Schools Bundle 5, payments under the PPP contract will not be made until the full works and services as set out under the project agreement are satisfactorily delivered for each school.</p></reply>

There are measures in place to ensure that budgetary targets are being met.  Monthly expenditure profiles are published and the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored and reported on against these profiles on a monthly basis in the Exchequer Statement. </p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Exchequer Statement, total gross Voted Expenditure at end-February 2018 was &euro;9,062 million. This is &euro;167 million, or 1.8%, below profile and an increase of &euro;396 million, or 4.6%, on the same period in 2017.  Of this, gross voted current expenditure accounts for &euro;8,626 million, which is &euro;83 million, or 1%, below profile and an increase of &euro;406 million, or 4.9% on the same period in 2017.  The full year increase in current spending for 2018 is estimated at 3.6%.  Gross voted capital expenditure accounts for &euro;435 million, which is &euro;83 million, or 16.1%, below profile and a decrease of &euro;10 million, or 2.2% on February 2017.  The full year REV allocation for capital spending provides for an increase of c. 26% compared to the estimated outturn for 2017.  </p>  <p>  2018 is the fourth consecutive year in which the Government have been able to provide for an increase in spending on public services.  Given this context, it is crucial that this growth is managed in a sustainable manner within agreed allocations.  However, given the scale of overall voted expenditure, almost &euro;61 billion in aggregate for 2018, and the impact that unforeseen events, such as for example, Storm Emma, can have on expenditure requirements in certain areas, my Department is in regular contact with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.</p></reply>

The evidence-base and approach taken to the public capital investment plans in the NDP were strongly informed and guided by the assessment of key issues contained in:-</p>  <p>  - The Review of the 2015 Capital Plan published last September which confirmed the compelling case for increased public capital investment and identified priority sectors for increased investment.</p>  <p>  - The Infrastructure Demand and Capacity Analysis prepared by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service in my Department published alongside the Review of the Capital Plan which assessed on the basis of available evidence the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s public capital stock and key drivers of future infrastructure demand.</p>  <p>  - The IMF Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) for Ireland which highlighted that while, by international standards, infrastructure management practices in Ireland are generally well developed there are a number of areas where significant improvements can be made to ensure that public investment is efficient and value-for-money.</p>  <p>  The NDP sets out &euro;116 billion in total public capital investment over the ten years of 2018-2027.  This includes &euro;91 billion Exchequer investment and &euro;25 billion commercial State Owned Enterprise investment.  Approximately &euro;60 billion of this Exchequer investment is new additional funding for the period 2022-2027.  I have also provided additional funding over 2019-2021 in order to permit the four new Funds announced in the NDP to be established with effect from 2019.  The aggregate amount involved is &euro;765m over the three year period.</p>  <p>  The OECD and IMF find that the productive capacity of the economy and its growth potential can be raised by changing the composition of expenditure in favour of capital spending.  Against the backdrop of the current cyclical position of the economy, with the labour market approaching estimates of full employment, stronger than projected growth could potentially lead to overheating pressures.  However, the scale and pace of increased capital expenditure envisaged under the NDP is intended to minimise the contribution of public capital investment to overheating risks in the coming years.  In addition, it is important to recognise the impact of the very substantial public capital programme contained in the NDP on the supply side of the economy and productivity &ndash; the key driver of long-term economic growth.</p></reply>

This was particularly the case when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in terms of its ability to fund infrastructure directly, given their use of private finance, on an off-balance sheet basis.  This enabled projects to proceed which would not otherwise have been deliverable on the basis of Exchequer funding alone.</p>  <p>  In ensuring Departments obtain the best value-for-money from public capital investment, PPPs, just as traditionally procured projects, are subject to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as traditionally procured projects.  All projects over &euro;20m are required under the Public Spending Cote to be subject to a Cost Benefit Analysis or Cost Effectiveness Analysis.  In addition, all public investment projects of this value must also be referred to the National Development Finance Agency for advice in terms of the options for financing and procuring the projects.   </p>  <p>  As outlined in the NDP, PPPs will continue to feature as a procurement option available to Government for appropriately structured projects which demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option and which meet the robust and rigorous tests for project appraisal that apply to all public investment projects under the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  While there are a number of previously announced PPP projects in the pipeline for delivery over the coming years, no further specific additional projects have been identified in the NDP for procurement by PPP at this stage.  Rather, it is essential that projects are judged on their merits and if procurement by PPP is found to offer better value-for-money than traditional procurement in the case of individual projects identified for delivery in the NDP, then they should be selected and progressed by the relevant sponsoring Department or agency on that basis. </p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  The Local Authorities have responsibility for the maintenance of a number of rivers in the Erne catchment.  In addition, the Erne Catchment is being assessed under the Office of Public Work&rsquo;s in close co-operation with the Rivers section in the Department for Infrastructure, Northern Ireland.  This co-operation is part of our respective implementation of the EU Floods Directive and therefore the Erne Catchment in both Ireland and Northern Ireland has been fully assessed as part of the CFRAM Study.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Erne Catchment system, CFRAM&rsquo;s Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) study, carried out in 2011, identified Cavan Town and Ballyconnell in Co. Cavan and Ballybay in Co. Monaghan as Areas of Further Assessment (AFA) and are being assessed as part of the North Western-Neagh Bann CFRAM Study.  This included public consultation events held in Spring 2015 on the draft flood maps, Spring 2016 on the preliminary options and Autumn 2016 on the draft plans.</p>  <p>  In Cavan Town and Ballybay structural options are proposed in the draft Flood Risk Management Plan; and Ballyconnell has been assessed to have a very low level of flood risk.  The Plans also set out other flood risk measures to address the flood risk along the River Erne catchment.</p>  <p>  In summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) for an independent review of the environmental assessments. Having now received the outcomes of the independent review of the environmental assessments for the Flood Risk Management Plans, the Commissioners of Public Works are submitting the Flood Risk Management Plans to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for approval. </p></reply>

This new phase of public service reform focuses on supporting sustainable, continuous progress across the public service. It aims to build a stronger public service and to deliver better quality services to the Irish public. </p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 contains an added focus on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture.  The newly established Reform Evaluation Unit will work closely with units within my Department focused on performance budgeting and spending reviews to strengthen the links between expenditure and reform.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the framework has begun.  There are 18 actions which include new initiatives and actions focused on building on reforms already in place.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is prudent and sustainable.  There are a number of budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews.  The actions in Our Public Service 2020 will ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services, while operating within these prudent limits.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) which was set up in 2012, leads a programme of evaluation of public service delivery across the public service which allows decision-makers to look at trends, outputs, impact and sustainability of public spending.</p>  <p>  Public service reform is continuing to deliver savings and value for money across a range of specific areas such as shared services, procurement reform and property management.  While these savings free up expenditure, we need to learn the lessons of the past and spend in a smart and efficient manner.  A review of day-to-day Government spending took place before Budget 2018.  The 2017 Spending Review was the first in a series of rolling, selective reviews, which will cover the totality of Government spending over a three-year period to 2019.  The results of the first year of this new approach are published with the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2017.  Moderate, sustainable, expenditure growth is now planned over the medium-term.  However, increasing and competing public service demands will mean managing expenditure, and this is likely to prove challenging. The 2018 Spending Reviews are now underway.</p></reply>

Of these 96 properties, 48 (50%) are Garda stations that were closed under the 2012/2013 policing plans of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An interim report from the Policing Authority subsequently identified six of the closed stations for re-opening.  A further review is being conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to the remaining stations.  The future use of these other, former Garda stations can only be determined once this further review is concluded.</p><p>Of the remaining 48 properties that are vacant at present:</p><p>-  22 are in the process of being transferred to local authorities or are under consideration for transfer</p><p>- 10 are being considered/prepared for disposal</p><p>- 1 is under consideration for community use</p><p>- 15 are being retained for alternative State use or for strategic purposes</p><p><b>Sites (Land)</b>OPW own 32, currently vacant, sites that range in size from a plot of ground measuring 300 square metres to one site of 31 acres.  These sites were acquired over the years for a variety of uses including: customs posts, met stations; sites for the Courts Service or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They also include sites acquired for the purposes of the legacy, decentralisation programme for Government Departments/Offices. </p><p>A total of 12 of these sites have been identified as being suitable for transfer to relevant State bodies or are being retained for future State development.  The future use, or disposal of the remaining 20 is under consideration.  As a matter of policy, no property is disposed of on the open market until other State bodies, including the Local Authority sector, are advised of their availability for use.  All property use is contingent on the necessary planning permissions being in place. In terms of zoning or re-zoning these sites/land, it is a matter for the relevant local authorities to determine in line with their own Local Area Plans.</p><p><b>Dwellings and Lodges</b>In addition to these properties, there are sundry dwellings or lodges that are intrinsic to the estates of National Parks and Gardens throughout the country and are managed by the Office of Public Works.  In general, these dwellings or lodges are allocated to staff where there is a requirement for officials to be present on the ground, for example, Park Rangers, Deer Keepers, security personnel etc.In other cases, they have been licensed for use as Tea Rooms, as part of Visitor Services on Heritage Sites or for use by the Irish Landmark Trust.  </p><p>At present, there are approx. 20 of these properties currently vacant around the country that are in poor condition and not habitable from a health and safety or security viewpoint. Additional information on the status of these properties was provided in a written Parliamentary Question answered by my colleague, Minister of State Kevin &lsquo;Boxer&rsquo; Moran on Tuesday, 14 November, 2017.</p><p><b>Properties available for social housing</b>The provision of social/affordable and emergency residential accommodation is a function that rests with the local authorities and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Properties owned or managed by the OPW are primarily commercial offices, Garda stations, warehouses or others that are not suited to residential use. The OPW however has actively engaged with that Department in providing information on any non-operational, vacant properties or sites in its ownership.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government then assesses those properties or sites in terms of what might be suitable for residential use.  </p><p>The OPW periodically reviews its own portfolio to ensure that any void or vacant properties are correctly categorised.  As a matter of course, the OPW provides information on its non-operational properties and sites to the relevant authorities/housing agencies, for assessment.  In the past 2 years this process has identified a number of properties as being feasible for adaption for residential use.  These include:</p><p>- 8 residential units in Dublin City Centre that were transferred to Dublin City Council for use by the Peter McVerry Trust</p><p>- A property in Crumlin, Dublin that is now licensed to Dublin City Council for use as a Family Hub</p><p>- A property in the North inner city, Dublin that is in the process of being transferred to Dublin City Council for use by the Peter McVerry Trust</p><p>A further 15 properties are currently being considered in terms of their potential for investment and adaptation for social housing.  These include:</p><p>- 7 properties and 1 site that are under consideration by Cork County Council</p><p>- 5 properties that are under consideration by Tipperary County Council</p><p>- 3 properties that are under consideration by Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council.</p><p>Aside from the above, the OPW has regular engagement with local authorities and other State bodies to identify other State uses for any surplus properties or sites, in advance of any decision to sell on the open market.

National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations.  Under EU law, public contracts above a certain value must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process. The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. </p><p>Directive 2014/24/EU dealing with the public procurement of goods, services and works was transposed into Irish law by way of S.I. No. 284/2016.  This requires tenderers to comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law that apply at the place where the works are carried out or the services provided that have been established by European Union law, national law, collective agreements or by international labour law. The requirement features in key aspects of the new rules at relevant stages in the procurement process, i.e. when applying the discretionary exclusion grounds, when deciding whether to award a contract to the most economically advantageous tenderer, when assessing abnormally low tenders and, where appropriate, in relation to subcontracting. Contracting authorities must also take appropriate measures to ensure contract performance is in accordance with these obligations. </p><p>These requirements are reflected in the current Office of Government Procurement template documents for goods and services which have been developed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.  These can be viewed on the OGP website at <i><i></i></i>.  They are also reflected in public works contracts which require a contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site. Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.  </p><p>It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the public procurement process.  I would also point out that under Section 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993 an Accounting Officer is required to give evidence to the Public Accounts Committee regarding: the regularity and propriety of the transactions recorded or required to be recorded in any account subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General which he/she or the Department concerned is required by or under statute to prepare; the economy and efficiency of the Department in the use of its resources; and the systems, procedures and practices employed by the Department for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of its operations. </p><p>Finally, employment law and its enforcement, in both public and private contracts, is a matter for the relevant State authorities, including the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

These organisations deliver a wide array of much needed support services at community level to a very varied range of users on a day to day basis throughout the year. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware however that such organisations are private sector concerns in respect of which my Department has not actual corporate responsibility or direct involvement. The staff of such organisations, which may exceed 100,000 in number, are not public servants and as such did not, for example, fall within the application of the FEMPI legislation involving as it did the reduction in pay and increase in pension contribution for public servants. It is correspondingly the case that current public service pay policy does not extend to such organisations. </p>  <p>  It will be appreciated that such entities are accordingly self governing and accountable for the management of their own internal financial resources. While it is the case that  certain or indeed, in some cases, all of these financial resources may come from government funding it remains the position that decisions on pay expenditure issues arising in such entities are matters that are determined at the discretion of the management authorities of each of the organisations concerned. The issue of pay is just one important challenge within a complex mix of other challenges and demands that the individual organisations concerned are required to decide upon and manage.  </p>  <p>  Having regard therefore to these circumstances it is a matter for each of these private sector organisations to resolve the financial challenges that they may face in accordance with the financial resources available to them, whatever the source may be of such funding arrangements. If organisations have made changes in payment to their staff during the period of FEMPI cuts taking place for public servants then it is a matter on which those organisations should engage with their staff. The individuals who work in these organisations are not employees of the State and these are therefore not matters for outside parties including my Department to become involved in.</p></reply>

The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. </p>  <p>  In this regard, public procurement rules include provisions that allow Member States to require a contractor to comply with EU and National legislation on the protection of labour rights. As a consequence public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts and applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social contributions.  They must also be compliant with relevant labour law. These requirements are set out in the template documents used in tendering for goods and services which have been developed by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.   In relation to public works, contract conditions require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site. Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.</p>  <p>  Overall, the management of a tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the public procurement process.     Accounting Officers of Government Departments and Offices are responsible under Public Financial Procedures for the safeguarding of public funds and property under their control; for the regularity and propriety of all the transactions in each Appropriation Account bearing their signatures; and for the efficiency and economy of administration of their Department/Office.</p>  <p>  Finally, employment law and its enforcement, in both public and private contracts, is a matter for the relevant State authorities, including the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

This is also a commitment within the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.</p>  <p>  In line with the international best practice in this area, the intention is to ensure that an equality perspective is integrated within the budgetary process rather than being a separate process. </p>  <p>  There is currently a pilot cycle of equality budgeting which focuses on a number of diverse expenditure programmes already in existence across a range of Departments.  The Departments participating in the pilot conducted an assessment of the chosen policy areas with a view to defining high level equality objectives and performance indicators for the policies in question.  These objectives and performance indicators were outlined in the 2018 Revised Estimates Volume (REV), which was published in December last year. The 2017 Public Service Performance Report, which is currently in preparation, will contain an update on the progress and steps that are being taken by these Departments to work towards realising their objectives. </p>  <p>  An expert advisory group is also currently being established which will provide advice on the most effective way to advance the initiative. Alongside this we will also continue to work supporting Departments to develop the skills necessary to successfully equality proof policies.</p>  <p>  Equality budgeting forms part of the broader expenditure management framework that is focussed on efficient, effective, sustainable and impactful public spending.  This has guided our approach to the Spending Review process, that over a three year period is looking to examine the totality of day to day Government spending.  The approach being adopted with the equality budgeting initiative flows from this approach, where we look at existing spending programmes from the equality perspective, rather than just having a focus on the incremental budgetary changes.  Building the equality budgeting metrics into the REV, with subsequent reporting on delivery in the Public Service Performance Report will support both ex ante and ex post assessment from an equality perspective.   </p></reply>

As set out in the NDP, a potential growth rate of 2% in volume terms is assumed over the period 2022 to 2027.  This potential growth rate aligns with the most recent long-term growth projection from the European Commission for Ireland for the 2020s while being lower than the OECD long-term projection of almost 3% for that period.  </p>  <p>  The prudent approach taken to the macro-economic and public capital investment framework in the plan is confirmed in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s historic growth performance averaging about 4&frac12;% over the whole of the period from 1966 &ndash; 2017.  The 2% real growth assumption for 2022 to 2027 is supplemented with the conventional assumption that inflation will average 2% in line with the upper limit of the ECB&rsquo;s inflation target yielding a 4% nominal growth projection over the period.  </p>  <p>  The projections used for the National Development Plan are appropriately prudent and conservative in light of the research carried out by the ESRI and Copenhagen Economics on Brexit. According to the Copenhagen Economics study, the more recent of these reports, in a scenario of a European Economic Area (EEA) agreement with the U.K. potential growth in the period 2030 is projected to be reduced to an annual average of 2%.  Similarly, a hard Brexit is projected to reduce potential growth in the period to 2030 to an annual average of 1.7%.  The baseline in that report is 2.2% growth in GDP per annum.</p>  <p>  This is compared to the 2% projection underlying the NDP.  Furthermore, the Copenhagen Economics study does not take account of the impact of the very substantial public capital programme contained in the NDP on the supply side of the economy and productivity &ndash; the key driver of long-term economic growth.</p>  <p>  In comparison to 2018, capital expenditure will increase by 25% in 2019, 35% in 2020 and 38% in 2021.  Updated calculations of fiscal space will be published in the Summer Economic Statement 2018 following the publication by the European Commission of the required inputs to the calculation in conjunction with its Spring Economic Forecast.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Economic and Fiscal Outlook published by the Department of Finance at Budget-time last year projected that Ireland will move from a small General Government Deficit as a share of GDP to a General Government Surplus approaching 1 per cent of GDP by 2021, inclusive of the projected infrastructure spending in the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  It is also important to state that this approach is fully in line with the fiscal rules. While my Department did not consult with the IFAC in relation to the National Development Plan, my Department did note IFAC's broad support for the Government's proposed approach to increased public capital investment, in its November 2017 Fiscal Assessment Report.</p></reply>

This will set out the limits for the budget of the European Union post 2020 and proposals in relation to the different areas of EU activity, including Cohesion funding. </p>  <p>  Without prejudice to the Commission proposals, or the negotiations that will follow, it is likely that there will be considerable budgetary pressures, not least because of the financial implications arising from Brexit, coupled with competition for funding to meet new EU objectives in areas such as migration, security and defence, climate change and digital transformation.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Government agreed a position paper on the MFF on 18 February.  This paper notes that &ldquo;in the next MFF, it will be important to ensure appropriate levels of spending on the traditional priorities such as agriculture and cohesion programmes.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department also published a position paper on Cohesion Policy post 2020 in November 2017.  While this paper highlights the value placed by Ireland on Cohesion policy as an investment tool, it also raises issues which need to be addressed in the next round: the urgent need to simplify the unnecessary regulatory complexity surrounding the management of the EU Funded Programmes; the need for a common set of regulations across funds in order to leverage synergies; the need for increased flexibility to allow Member States target investment at areas of most relevance to them and the need for &ldquo;proportionality&rdquo; i.e. that Member States with a strong track-record of successfully implementing previous rounds of funding and who also provide co-financing, will only have to report on outcomes or results to the Commission.</p>  <p>  My Department provided a comprehensive brief on the above matters to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach earlier this month.

The average capital investment in the EU over the last twenty years was in the region of 3% of national income.  Under the National Development Plan it is projected that public capital investment will reach 3.8% of national income (GNI*) in 2021 and 4% by 2024. </p>  <p>  As noted in the report, work is underway by my Department to enhance the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of current expenditure through the ongoing Spending Review process.  The 2017 Spending Review was the first in a series of rolling, selective reviews, which will cover the totality of Government spending over a three year period to 2019.  This process allows for the systematic examination of existing spending programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives and to identify the scope for re-prioritising expenditure to meet Government expenditure priorities. </p>  <p>  I note the concerns expressed in the report with regards to some in-year overruns in certain Government departments. Managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister and it is very important that public services are delivered within the agreed allocations.  While some additional voted funding was allocated to certain Departments last year, the report notes that overall spending remained within the 2017 target.</p></reply>

Individual Accounting Officers are responsible for ensuring that their public procurement function are discharged in line with the standard accounting and procurement rules and procedures and that contract prices are fair and reasonable and represent best value for money. </p>  <p>  In relation to the suggestion that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should consider publication of the 40/02 submissions on a yearly basis, I would point out that details of non-competitive tenders are already available and on the public record in the Appropriation Accounts published annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Therefore, I do not consider it appropriate for my Department or the Office of Government Procurement to cut across this function.   Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement. </p>  <p>  Finally, the OGP supports compliance by putting in place compliant procurement solutions, publishing guidelines and template documentation and proactive engagement with Government Departments and Offices including our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive.</p></reply>

Under those Schemes, maximum retirement benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension, the rate of which varies according to retiring rank and other factors, is payable for the person&rsquo;s lifetime. </p>  <p>  Where qualifying service is more than 21 years, an &lsquo;additional increment&rsquo; is payable at a flat rate (generally &euro;8.94 a week currently) for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years.  However, under the pension scheme rules, this additional increment ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age for the social welfare State Pension Contributory, that is, at age 66 to 68 depending on when the insured person was born.  The foregoing pension scheme rules were applied to the person in question when he qualified for the State Pension at age 66 in 2013. </p>  <p>  I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension. </p>  <p>  Integration means that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to social insurance benefits is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries.  </p>  <p>  I am also advised that the method of integration for these &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; military pensioners is more favourable than in other areas of the public service where standard integration applies. In the public service generally, integration begins from the time the retirement pension starts payment, for example from age 60 where &lsquo;standard pension accrual&rsquo; applies.  However, these NCOs or Privates who serve 31 years having joined the Defence Forces at age 18/20, can qualify for maximum retirement benefits payable immediately from age 49/51.  In their case, the integration process only begins when the State Pension becomes payable to them, for example, at age 66.  Furthermore, the maximum personal rate of the State Pension (&euro;238.30 currently) is considerably greater than any reduction that could arise under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pension arrangements by virtue of the loss of the additional increment on qualification for the State Pension. </p>  <p>  The general issue of integration of retirement pensions in the public service was examined by the Commission on Public Service Pensions.  Its Final Report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued.  It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pensions schemes.</p></reply>

Concerns around these issues have led to significant tensions and even violence in recent years, which we have discussed in the Oireachtas. </p><p>The issues involved can be very complex and multifaceted.  There are many Christian denominations present, and their churches and traditional status and rights predate not only the foundation of Israel but even the former British Mandate, and go back to the Ottoman period or even earlier.  Some European partners have historical and treaty links to various Christian denominations, and the Jordanian Government retains a role as guardians of the Muslim holy places.  Jerusalem is uniquely sensitive, and Israel&rsquo;s discriminatory treatment of Palestinians and their land rights under the occupation has meant that any proposed changes to the regime pertaining to religious properties are viewed with deep suspicion.</p><p>I do not wish to comment on the specific issues which led to the brief closure as a protest of some of the Christian churches in Jerusalem last month. While the immediate threat was lifted, and the churches reopened, these matters are not resolved and could recur. </p><p>However, both Ireland and the European Union have consistently and on a number of occasions in recent years stressed the important principle that there should be no change in the <i>status quo</i>with regard to religious affairs, properties and rights in Jerusalem and the Occupied Territory, pending the final resolution of the position of the city and the holy places in a peace agreement.  I have made this point myself directly to the Israeli authorities, and I repeat that principle again now.  My Department has also met with religious representatives from the city and the region. We will continue to do so, and to address the Israeli authorities on these issues.</p></reply>

This support includes political efforts to encourage a resumption of direct negotiations, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace.  It also includes action on the ground on human rights and justice issues affecting Palestinians under occupation, including settlement activity, which are progressively endangering the prospects of such a peace agreement.</p>  <p>  During my working visit to Israel and Palestine in January, on which I have reported to the House, I met with both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as other representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and discussed with them reinvigorating the effort towards peace in the Middle East.</p>  <p>  In recent months the new United States administration has been exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement. This engagement is very welcome, and I have met myself with the US team to encourage their work, and to underline to them the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused. </p>  <p>  In recent discussions with my EU colleagues, I have stated that the EU must continue to encourage an appropriate US initiative, but that the EU must also continue our own work, including work on the ground, to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved, and help to combat negative trends, including the deteriorating situation in Gaza.  I am actively exploring with EU colleagues how this can best be done. </p>  <p>  Immediately after my visit to the region in January, I spoke directly to the US authorities, and pressed strongly for the continuation of US support to UNRWA.  Ireland has provided funding of &euro;8 million to UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeals since 2006, of which &euro;500,000 was provided in 2017.  In light of the exceptional circumstances UNRWA is facing, Ireland brought forward our 2018 core contribution to the Organisation&rsquo;s Programme Budget. Earlier this month, Ireland pledged an additional &euro;250,000 to the Agency.</p>  <p>  I have given these issues a high priority in my work since assuming office, both at EU level and elsewhere, as I have reported to the House. </p></reply>

I have stressed the issue of settlements in EU discussions on the issue, in my direct meetings with the parties themselves, and in my engagement with the US administration on the peace proposals which they are formulating.</p><p>The essential principle followed by the EU for some years has been to clearly distinguish between its relations with Israel and Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory.  This principle was subsequently enunciated in Security Council Resolution 2334 in December 2016.Actions taken relating to settlements have included:</p><p>- The exclusion of settlement goods from the lower tariffs applied to goods from Israel (and other trading partners)</p><p>- The rule that EU research grants may not be spent in institutions located in Israeli settlements</p><p>- EU guidelines on accurate labelling of goods from settlements</p><p>- Advice to citizens on the risks of doing business or investing in settlements</p><p>- EU refusal to accept Israeli veterinary certification for meat products from settlements</p><p>- The decision of the Foreign Affairs Council that all future agreements with Israel must clearly state that they apply only to Israel itself</p><p>Ireland continues to advocate for strong measures against settlements, although there are differing views on this at EU level.  Measures that have been suggested include the exclusion of settlement goods altogether from the EU market, but it is clear that there would be no agreement on this for the moment.  This is not the same as a trade ban on Israel itself, which the Government does not support.</p></reply>

This is to ignore the fact that such permission is almost never granted to Palestinians, and that the relief in question was provided because of the failure of Israeli authorities to provide for adequate schools or other facilities for the Palestinian population under occupation, or to shelter families whose own property had been demolished.  The purpose of the demarche was to highlight the unacceptability of these practices, and to seek restitution for the loss to European taxpayers.  The principle rather than the money was the main focus of the action. </p>  <p>  Earlier today the Irish Ambassador participated in a further similar demarche to the Israeli authorities, seeking compensation or restitution for a school building demolished in February in the threatened Palestinian community of Abu Nawar, a case we have discussed here in the D&aacute;il.</p></reply>

While there are elements of the report with which I do not agree, it nonetheless raises a number of important points.  The report highlights the challenges posed for the border if the UK leaves the Single Market and Customs Union.  It also calls on the UK Government to bring forward proposals on how to maintain an invisible border, and seeks clarity on a number of other important areas.</p>  <p>  The Government has always been clear that technology is not the solution to the border issues.  The report from the NIAC recognises that this is the case.  The border poses complexes challenges, including for the standards and regulations that currently make it possible for it to be invisible.  Technology can only go so far and does not address all of the complexities.  The border issues need to be considered holistically, which is why the Government has taken the position that it has.</p>  <p>  There has been progress made this week between the two negotiating teams on parts of the Withdrawal Agreement, including on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The UK has agreed that a legally operative version of the &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; for the border will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Report published last December.  There is also agreement that this is to apply unless and until another solution is found.  </p>  <p>  The UK has also agreed that all the issues identified in the EU draft of the Protocol will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution to the border.  In this regard, the EU and the UK have agreed on an intensive schedule of meetings starting next week.  Ireland will continue to work closely with Michel Barnier and his team and EU partners in line with our objective of achieving an orderly withdrawal by the UK, which protects fully Ireland&rsquo;s essential interests.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-22a.136.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032200039#WRD02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.</p>  <p>  The threat that fuel fraud and the illicit tobacco trade pose to legitimate business, to consumers and the Exchequer is recognised and I am advised by Revenue that tackling such criminal activity has been one of their priorities over recent years.</p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s strategy for combatting the illegal fuel trade has included the introduction of stringent supply chain controls and reporting requirements for fuel transactions to minimise the scope for fraud.  It also included a programme of enforcement action, underpinned by legislative changes including a &ldquo;reckless trading&rdquo; provision under excise law for oil traders, that have been introduced over a number of Finance Acts, to strengthen Revenue&rsquo;s powers for dealing with this kind of fraud.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to introduce from the beginning of April 2015, in Ireland and the United Kingdom, a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels.</p>  <p>  I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in significantly curtailing fuel fraud in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel in recent years.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted National Random Sampling Programmes in 2016, 2017 and 2018 with a view to obtaining an updated picture of the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programmes involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence).  Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the marker introduced in 2015.  In all three years, no evidence of this marker was found in any of the samples tested.  This constitutes persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has resulted in the near elimination of selling of laundered product at retail level.  The available evidence to date indicates that Accutrace cannot be laundered by conventional methods.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that while the effectiveness of the measures introduced over the last few years is very welcome as is the very positive outcome of the collaboration with HMRC, Revenue is not complacent and is mindful of the resourcefulness of those involved in criminality in the fuel trade.  Revenue remains vigilant and ready to respond to any new developments in this area. </p>  <p>  Action is taken against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade and includes a range of measures to identify and target persons engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those involved. Revenue&rsquo;s multifaceted strategy encompasses ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, the use of analytics and detection technologies, optimising the deployment of resources and extensive cooperation (including the development and sharing of intelligence) on a national, EU and international basis.</p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the risk based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages contribute to the effectiveness of Revenue&rsquo;s goal of intercepting the supply of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue also targets the illicit trade in tobacco at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Action has also been taken through Finance Acts over recent years to ensure that Revenue has the statutory powers necessary for undertaking its important work against the illegal tobacco trade.</p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Revenue, who in a joint operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as part of the Joint Agency Task Force, last week closed down an illicit commercial cigarette factory in Jenkinstown, Co. Louth.  I understand from Revenue that this was the first time a commercial illicit cigarette production plant was discovered in the State and the factory was in full operation when Revenue officers and the Armed Support Unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na entered the premises.  Revenue officers found more than 60 tonnes of tobacco, all the pre-cursor components for the manufacture of cigarettes, and approximately 25 million cigarettes ready for distribution.  This was a sophisticated self-contained operation with machinery capable of producing 250,000 illicit cigarettes per hour and pre-processing, processing and packaging facilities, along with living quarters.</p>  <p>  In assessing the overall effectiveness in tackling the illegal tobacco trade, a reliable measure is provided by the annual surveys of illegal tobacco products carried out by IPSOS/MRBI for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive.  The survey in 2017 found that 13% of cigarette packs encountered in the course of the project were illicit.  This figure is slightly up from the levels of 12% and 10% reported in 2015 and 2016 respectively but is nevertheless lower than in earlier years.</p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel and tobacco fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up in 2016, in the framework of &ldquo;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&rdquo;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat both the illicit fuel and tobacco trades.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action in these areas will continue to be a high priority.  In addition, I can say to the Deputy that I will give careful consideration to any further proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue to enhance their capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in these areas. </p></reply>

As set out in the NDP, a potential growth rate of 2% in volume terms is assumed over the period 2022 to 2027.  This potential growth rate aligns with the most recent long-term growth projection from the European Commission for Ireland for the 2020s while being lower than the OECD long-term projection of almost 3% for that period.  </p><p>The prudent approach taken to the macro-economic and public capital investment framework in the plan is confirmed in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s historic growth performance averaging about 4&frac12;% over the whole of the period from 1966 &ndash; 2017.  The 2% real growth assumption for 2022 to 2027 is supplemented with the conventional assumption that inflation will average 2% in line with the upper limit of the ECB&rsquo;s inflation target yielding a 4% nominal growth projection over the period.  </p><p>The projections used for the National Development Plan are appropriately prudent and conservative in light of the research carried out by the ESRI and Copenhagen Economics on Brexit. According to the Copenhagen Economics study, the more recent of these reports, in a scenario of a European Economic Area (EEA) agreement with the U.K. potential growth in the period 2030 is projected to be reduced to an annual average of 2%.  Similarly, a hard Brexit is projected to reduce potential growth in the period to 2030 to an annual average of 1.7%.  The baseline in that report is 2.2% growth in GDP per annum.</p><p>This is compared to the 2% projection underlying the NDP.  Furthermore, the Copenhagen Economics study does not take account of the impact of the very substantial public capital programme contained in the NDP on the supply side of the economy and productivity &ndash; the key driver of long-term economic growth.</p><p>In terms of fiscal space, the NDP announced four new funds which will begin operating from 2019.  The funds will be partly covered by an unallocated capital reserve in the first instance, leaving an additional cost, which will both pre-commit unallocated fiscal space and impact on the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement (EBR).  The EBR and general government debt developments table will be updated in the draft Stability Programme Update for 2018 to be published in mid-April.</p><p>The estimated cost, in fiscal space terms, of the four funds is &euro;144 million over the period 2019-2021 as follows:<table><tr><th>&euro; - millions </th><th>2019 </th><th>2020 </th><th>2021 </th></tr><tr><td>Fiscal Space Used </td><td>54 </td><td>36 </td><td>54 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the Economic and Fiscal Outlook published by the Department of Finance at Budget-time last year projected that Ireland will move from a small General Government Deficit as a share of GDP to a General Government Surplus approaching 1 per cent of GDP by 2021, inclusive of the projected infrastructure spending in the National Development Plan. </p><p>It is also important to state that this approach is fully in line with the fiscal rules.  While my Department did not consult with the IFAC in relation to the National Development Plan, my Department did note IFAC's broad support for the Government's proposed approach to increased public capital investment, in its November 2017 Fiscal Assessment Report.</p></reply>

In accordance with international best practice, PPP contracts typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to ensure that the project proceeds to completion.  The case the Deputy refers to highlights the prudential need for and value of such arrangements.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of such PPP contracts, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium&rsquo;s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State.</p>  <p>  This process is underway in the case of the Schools Bundle 5 PPP (as a consequence of the Carillion plc liquidation).  Liquidation of a company such as Carillion plc is an unfortunate development but would impact all projects regardless of whether procured traditionally or by means of a PPP.  The issue, therefore, is not PPP-specific. </p>  <p>  The contractual mechanisms within a PPP project agreement are designed to limit the State&rsquo;s financial exposure in such a scenario.  An important feature of PPPs (which does not arise in traditional procurement) is that no payments are made until the facilities are handed over to the State and are operational.  Once facilities are operational, payments to the PPP company are linked to service performance and availability of the facilities over the lifetime of the contract, and deductions apply when the facilities are not performing or are unavailable.  The latter payment mechanism is not a feature of a traditional model which has regular milestone payments during construction.</p>  <p>  PPPs continue to provide benefits to the State as a procurement method which enables the public sector to harness the innovation, commercial and management expertise and efficiencies of the private sector to design, build, finance, operate and maintain State facilities with a specified residual life on handback.  PPPs will continue to be a procurement method available to the State for appropriately structured projects where they demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware I established an Inter-Departmental/Inter-Agency Group last year to review Ireland's experience of using PPP and to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs, in the context of the new 10 year capital plan.  I would expect the Group's deliberations to take account of any implications for future national PPP policy of the development referred to in the Deputy's question.  It is currently intended that the outcome of the review will be published alongside the new capital plan.</p></reply>

The flood risk for each of these areas has been assessed, through detailed engineering techniques to assess their risk and impact from flooding.  This risk and the proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified to manage that risk are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  In the upper Lee catchment, the following areas Inchigeelagh, Ballingeary, Macroom and Ballymakeera/Ballyvourney were designated as AFA&rsquo;s and were assessed under the South Western CFRAM Study. </p>  <p>  In relation to Macroom, a pre feasibility study of the flooding problem in the area has recently been completed by the OPW Design Section, which has recommended that a more detailed feasibility study would commence by the Summer of 2018.</p>  <p>  A flood relief scheme for Ballymakeera/Ballyvourney is currently at outline design stage where the preferred options for the scheme are being finalised.  The second Public Information Day will be held on 22 March, 2018 and this will be followed by a Public Exhibition of the preferred scheme in the latter half of 2018.</p>  <p>  Proposed measures has been identified in the Flood Risk Management Plans for Inchigeelagh and Ballingeary. </p>  <p>  In summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an independent review of the environmental assessments.  Having now received the outcomes of the independent review of the environmental assessments for the Flood Risk Management Plans, the Commissioners of Public Works are now submitting the Flood Risk Management Plans to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for approval. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan 2018-2027 commits to almost &euro;1 billion in funding for flood relief schemes, with annual Capital funding for the OPW doubling to &euro;100m by 2021.  This funding will support continued investment in schemes at construction and design.  Once the Plans are approved, I intend to announce a prioritised initial tranche of schemes proposed by the Plans to progress to detailed project level assessment and that provide greatest return for Government investment. </p></reply>

I, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, negotiated a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.</p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers.  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently laid before the Oireachtas a report on the matter of the pay of new entrants to the public service.  The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011.  The total cost of such adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.  The report also acknowledges that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).  Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.</p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussion on remaining salary scale issues with the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of newly qualified pay.  That process commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.</p></reply>

My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special school placements can access such placements.  This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department and the NCSE has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE advises Parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p>  <p>  Where Parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a special school placement for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of this Department.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is aware that many parents seek to enrol their child in a number of special schools and as such, an accurate figure on the number of additional placements required for next September will not emerge until Special Schools have completed their 2018/19 enrolment process.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that they continue to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in the Cork area for children with special educational needs, to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year.</p></reply>

On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service, so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it.  While certain aspects of the new approach have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue later this year.  I firmly believe that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.  </p>  <p>  To ensure State-wide coverage of GYDP services for young people, (which does not exist at present), the intention is that, in general, service provision will be aligned with Garda Divisions or other appropriate local areas with a distinct community identity as may be agreed during the consultation process.  Issues of community identify and numbers of potential participants on GYDPs in the area will be key considerations here.</p>  <p>  The provision of GYDP services in all parts of the State has obvious advantages, particularly in terms of providing services for significant numbers of young people who cannot currently access them.  I might add that an independent evaluation report of the operation of an integrated approach to delivery of GYDP services within County Kerry, commissioned by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) is expected shortly.  This report will help with the further development of the Call for Proposals documentation. </p>  <p>  GYDPs provide an effective and essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The principal focus of GYDPs is on young people who receive a Garda caution under the Diversion Programme for involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour and are referred to a local GYDP (primary referrals). GYDPs also accommodate a certain proportion of young people who are considered to be at risk of involvement in offending or anti-social behaviour (secondary referrals).</p>  <p>  In relation to secondary referrals, it has to be considered if, in principle, it is appropriate to refer a child to a Garda project where no criminal act has been identified.  For some, a better option might be referral to available mainstream youth services that could appropriately support them.  That being said, it is accepted that referrals to GYDPs must take account of local needs and issues in relation to access and availability of mainstream youth services.  Following the Call for Proposals process, GYDP services will still accommodate a certain proportion of secondary referrals and the proportion of these may vary from area to area depending on identified local needs. </p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of concerns expressed by youth justice workers and their representatives.  I can assure Deputies that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs as part of a wide-ranging consultation process, which is currently ongoing.  This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.  The consultation process will help to inform further development of the approach in advance of the Call for Proposals being issued, including in relation to the matters referred to by the Deputies.</p>  <p>  In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.</p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver valuable services for young people who have committed a crime or may be at risk of offending as well as providing important support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level.  I can assure Deputies that in the context of the Call for Proposals my Department is committed to ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and maintain a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers.  In this regard, I am advised that the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums, which could apply to provide services under the new GYDP model.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also a further 600 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the remainder of the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the format requested, as resources are assigned on a Divisional basis which does not necessarily accord to county boundaries.  For the Deputy's information, I have set out in the following table and link the number of Garda&iacute;, as advised by the Commissioner, assigned by Division, District and Rank as of 31 January 2018, and the strength of the Garda Fleet by Division as of 16 March 2018, the latest dates for which figures are currently available.</p><p><b>Strength of Garda Fleet, broken down by Division as at 16/03/2018</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Cars</th><th>Vans</th><th>Motorcycles</th><th>4x4</th><th>Others</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Fleet Total</td><td>1,947</td><td>456</td><td>117</td><td>104</td><td>118</td><td>2,742</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN‑MONAGHAN</td><td>44</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>39</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY</td><td>98</td><td>20</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>CORK NORTH</td><td>38</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>CORK WEST</td><td>40</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>DMR EAST</td><td>43</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>DMR HARCOURT SQUARE</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH</td><td>80</td><td>27</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH CENTRAL</td><td>52</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>DMR SOUTH</td><td>63</td><td>17</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>DMR SOUTH CENTRAL</td><td>45</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>DMR TRAFFIC</td><td>17</td><td>1</td><td>31</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>DMR WEST</td><td>71</td><td>17</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>50</td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>62</td><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>GARDA CENTRAL VETTING UNIT</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>H.R.M.

The Sub-Group prepared an approach for resettling people arriving under the IRPP according to a series of objective criteria including the population size of the county into which they were to be resettled.  The local authorities with responsibility for major urban areas, including the Dublin local authorities, are excluded from this approach due to pressure on local authority housing supply in those areas.  </p></reply>

However, the latter mechanism did not deliver the numbers envisaged and the Government has chosen to fill the gap by making additional pledges for programme refugees and through a new  Family Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP) scheme.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the IRPP for resettling Syrian refugees requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE and Tusla are represented on the national Taskforce which oversees delivery of the programme.  In general, coordination is ensured via the IRPP secretariat which is part of the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) within my Department.  OPMI are the primary entity responsible for delivering resettlement via a range of statutory and non-statutory agencies.  They have overseen the humanitarian resettlement programmes run by Ireland since they were established in 2000.  The Reception and Integration Agency, working closely with OPMI, is also responsible for contracting accommodation in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres.</p>  <p>  The International Protection Office based within the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) also play a prominent role  in this area as they independently determine applications for international protection that are made by asylum seekers arriving in Ireland through the EU relocation mechanism.  Staff of that office also serve as liaison officers in Greece and Italy, as required, working closely with national authorities and international organisations based in those states and providing orientation services on resettlement missions in Greece.  Staff of the OPMI also work on temporary assignments overseas in Greece and Lebanon to interview applicants for resettlement together with members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other state agencies as required.</p>  <p>  In general, I have responsibility for agencies falling within my own Department but as the resettlement process is mainstreamed other Ministers and other actors also have specific responsibilities, both statutory and non-statutory.</p>  <p>  My Department is mobilising European Union Funding under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) in support of Ireland's resettlement efforts.  Local Authorities play a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through the implementation of a process carried out by an "implementing partner" with expertise in community integration and relevant supports, supported by funding provided through OPMI and AMIF.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Irish Red Cross, who alongside UNHCR, are represented on the national IRPP Taskforce and who are one of our key partners.  The Government assigned the Irish Red Cross responsibility for administering public pledges of support, especially in the area of accommodation, and their case workers and support team work closely with IRPP and refugees to find suitable accommodation options.  IRPP has a memorandum of understanding with the Red Cross in relation to their role.</p>  <p>  In terms of practices and procedures, I set out below in general terms some of the key practices and procedures that are relevant to persons arriving under the Programme that are delivered by a range of bodies working to deliver the programme:</p>  <p>  - Programme refugees and asylum seekers eligible under the IRPP are interviewed abroad by Department officials to assess their needs and vulnerabilities and to initially orient them to Irish life and society.  Members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also accompany those mission and interview applicants from a security perspective.</p>  <p>  - IRPP staff and interpreters meet families and individuals upon arrival and accompany them to their initial accommodation in an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC).  As the name suggests, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently settled around the country.  In the EROCs both cohorts receive broadly the same integration services with due account being taken of the fact that certain things may not be able to happen until individuals receive a decision on their application for a grant of international protection.  IRPP staff hold regular clinics in the EROCs, often at weekly intervals, at which individuals and families may discuss their needs and requirements.  The client group also receive an orientation and language training programme while in the EROC.</p>  <p>  - During the days following arrival in Ireland, and after initial assessment and registration with the IPO, the asylum seekers arriving under relocation are registered with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for a public services card and receive an exceptional needs payment (ENP).  They are also assisted with registration with INIS.</p>  <p>  - IRPP officials provide assistance to ensure that families and individuals receive a medical card.</p>  <p>  - IRPP liaise with the Department of Education and Skills and the local Education and Training Board in each catchment area to ensure that groups receive a Language Training and Cultural Orientation programme and to facilitate access to education. Education provision is ensured for school age children by the Department of Education and Skills and Tusla where appropriate.</p>  <p>  - Local Service Providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the EROCs to provide services and information and to support and befriend the asylum seekers or refugees.</p>  <p>  - A GP is assigned to the individuals and families to ensure that their immediate medical needs are met including referral to dental and optical services.</p>  <p>  - Free Childcare is provided wherever possible to allow the adults to attend the Language and Orientation programme in their EROC.</p>  <p>  - Emergency medical matters are followed up while resident in the EROCs.</p>  <p>  - When housing is made available with the support of the Local Authority, the refugees will be resettled in the community with the support of the IRPP and volunteers in the local community.  Each family has the support of an assigned IRPP resettlement worker to assist with the transition along with the support of a full-time Resettlement Support Worker and an Intercultural Support Worker employed by the implementing partner under the auspices of the local authority.  Local authorities also receive some funding to provide for certain exceptional needs such counselling, transport and other supports.</p>  <p>  - When housing or accommodation is made available in an area through the Red Cross they provide an appropriate level of support to the refugees or, if possible, the refugees may be transitioned into the support programme run by the "implementing partner" under the auspices of the local authority if this opportunity exists in the relevant area.</p>  <p>  The IRPP integration model uses the existing best practice model in this area as pioneered by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) for refugee resettlement but it is also sufficiently flexible to work organically with community bodies, NGOs and civil society to see what else can be added to the integration model in order to assist and facilitate refugees.</p>  <p>  It is my firm intention that the model of integration and support is one which will evolve and develop over the coming months and years with a view to offering refugees increasing opportunities to enhance their own lives and it is for this reason I am examining initiatives such as community sponsorship to support the long-term integration process.</p></reply>

The Courts Service has confirmed that collectively these cities and towns will be the next priority for investment in courthouse facilities outside of the capital under the Courts Service provincial capital building programme.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-22a.266.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032200043#WRH01600"><p>As the Deputy will be aware my Department is obliged to carry out a Call for Proposals process during 2018 in relation to the provision of Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP) services, to fully comply with requirements related to the co-funding of projects by the European Social Fund Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the new approach to GYDP provision which is being developed in preparation for the Call for Proposals will not reduce the level of service that already exists, or the importance of community involvement in its delivery.  On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it. This improvement to the service will have benefits for significant numbers of young people in the State who cannot currently access GYDP services.  While certain aspects of the new service model have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue later this year.  I am convinced that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and to maintaining a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers.  In this regard, I am advised that the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums which could apply to provide services under the new GYDP model. In addition, and in line with the overall objective of providing GYDP services to all children and young persons who require them, I am advised that the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services. </p>  <p>  Careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs as part of a wide-ranging consultation process, which is currently ongoing.  This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.  The consultation process will help to inform further development of the Call for Proposals in advance of it being issued.</p>  <p>  As indicated above, the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services to current participants. It is of course a matter for organisations which apply to provide future GYDP services under the Call for Proposals to ensure that they comply with relevant legal responsibilities, including in relation to the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 131/2003).</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I might add that while my Department does provide funding, through the Irish Youth Justice Service, for the operation of over 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects, it is not the employer of the youth justice workers on these projects and has no human resources or industrial relations function in this regard.</p></reply>

I will shortly launch a &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme.  This scheme is designed to assist eligible businesses exposed to negative impacts resulting from Brexit in adjusting, changing, or adapting to mitigate these effects.  The finance offered under the scheme will be easier to access, more competitively priced, and at more favourable terms than current offerings. </p>  <p>  A Technical Working Group on State Aid comprising representatives from DG Competition, DBEI, EI and DAFM was established in November 2018.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with current applicable State Aid rules.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions.</p>  <p>  A notified Rescue and Restructuring (R&amp;R) scheme was approved by the Commission in late November 2017.  This scheme has been put in place as it is considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances as necessary.  Under the scheme, which will run until 2020, Enterprise Ireland can provide restructuring support to SMEs in severe financial difficulties.  </p>  <p>  As part of the deliberations of the Working Group on State Aid, it was agreed that my officials should extend the R&amp;R scheme to include temporary restructuring support for those SMEs who experience acute liquidity needs.  This extension, which has been pre-notified to the Commission, will be a welcome addition to our suite of supports for businesses impacted by Brexit.</p></reply>

The scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through finance providers to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million fund for the scheme is underpinned by a counter-guarantee from the European Commission and EIB Group through its InnovFin Loan Guarantee Scheme.  Under the terms of the InnovFin scheme, the Brexit Loan Scheme provides support for businesses to innovate or adapt their businesses to weather the period of uncertainty around Brexit. </p>  <p>  The scheme will be open to eligible businesses of up to 499 employees that can demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit.  They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, have a business development strategy and meet the scheme criteria.  The scheme will be open both to State Agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies.</p>  <p>  Further, my department is exploring the development of a new Business Finance Advisory Hub. This hub will assist SMEs in making informed funding and investment decisions.  The advisory hub will serve to ensure that SMEs are well informed of their funding and financing options, and will strengthen their financial planning skills.</p>  <p>  My officials are also working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Finance, the SBCI and EI in examining policy proposals for a new longer-term Business Investment Loan Scheme to support businesses to invest strategically for a post-Brexit environment.</p></reply>

The guidance aims to assist service providers to meet regulations and implement national standards.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of medicines management is to reduce medicine-related incidents, adverse events and inappropriate prescribing among vulnerable people who may be at risk.  These people may be considered at risk due to the nature of their illness, the characteristics of the medicines they are taking and the complexity of their medicines regime. </p>  <p>  I understand that the HIQA Guidance indicates that residents may choose to self-administer medicines with or without help and support from staff, where the risks of doing so have been comprehensively assessed, and that the assessment should consider the resident&rsquo;s wishes, the amount of support needed to independently use medicines, the resident&rsquo;s cognitive and physical abilities, and other factors.  I also understand that any changes to this risk assessment must be recorded and arrangements for self-administration of medicines kept under review.</p>  <p>  The Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003, as amended (S.I. 540 of 2003) set out the controls applicable to the prescription and supply of medicines to the public.</p>  <p>  In relation to service users of care services that are unable to administer medicines due to a physical disability, Regulation 4A(1)(a) provides that one person may administer to another a non-prescription medicine.  Furthermore, Regulation 4A(1)(c) provides that a person may administer to another person a prescription-only medicine, in accordance with the directions of a registered medical practitioner or dentist.</p>  <p>  These Regulations do not affect the autonomy or capacity of individual users of care services to self-manage their medicines.  Consequently there are no plans at present to amend the Regulations.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme.</p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;134 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate setting, giving consideration to their care needs and personal preferences.</p>  <p>  Under the NHSS legislation provision is made for long-term residential care, subject to the assessment of income and both cash and non-cash assets. In relation to the 22.5% cap on principal residence value, this applies only in the case of a principal residence held for the duration of long-term residential care.  Where an asset is realised or transferred within the five years immediately preceding entry or in the period following entry into the Scheme, this cap will not apply.   </p>  <p>  The NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation; consideration must be given to operational consequences and any unintended consequences that might result from any proposed changes. I am committed to ensuring older people are protected, particularly at what can be a vulnerable time in their lives and I am cognisant that changes to the Scheme could result in older people feeling obligated or under pressure to make their homes available for sale.   </p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, &amp;amp; Local Government (DHPLG) are working together on the issue of vacant homes as it relates to older who are in nursing home care. Officials from both Departments  have met and are exploring this issue. However, it is a matter of personal choice for an individual as to whether or not they wish to sell their home upon taking up residence in a nursing home.</p></reply>

It was asked to produce a series of action-focused recommendations.  The Taskforce report was published in December.  The report made a number of recommendations in different themed areas.  It also identified lead agencies associated with each recommendation that would be tasked with developing and/or implementing these as appropriate. </p>  <p>  A number of recommendations have been incorporated into the service plans of lead agencies for 2018.  These are:</p>  <p>  1. To establish a National Lead for Youth Mental Health and a Youth Mental Health lead in each Community Health Organisation areas; </p>  <p>  2. To examine various evidence based training options for improving mental health nationally;</p>  <p>  3. To develop perinatal information and support tools;</p>  <p>  4. To develop online digital support tools and signposting tools; and</p>  <p>  5. To support the establishment of a new interdepartmental team called Pathfinder to oversee youth mental health policy and prioritise youth mental health initiatives nationally</p>  <p>  I have set as a priority the development of a mental health telephone line, signposting tool and digital on-line supports for those accessing information about mental health.  Currently, Mental Health Services, within the HSE, have established a working group to progress this service, with the focus being on preventing mental health problems from developing and escalating.  The online supports produced will promote good mental health through empowering people to self-manage their mental wellbeing.  A significant challenge in respect of helpline services will be to integrate the existing specialist helplines into a single helpline number.  The Project Lead for the telephony strand of the project is also responsible for the HSE Live service and a consultation process is in place to seek the views of existing providers on how they could be integrated into a single helpline number.  A final date for roll-out of this service is yet to be determined, but significant work is ongoing.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed. It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population.</p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use. In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication.</p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017.  This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.</p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system.  All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes.</p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.</p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.  If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient.  The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.</p><p>As of 16 March 2018, there have been 5,504 online applications from GPs requesting the reimbursement of Versatis.  Of these applications, 1,059 patients (over 19%) have been approved.</p><p>Some 526 online appeals have been made, and over 69% of these patients have been approved.  The MMP has sought further information on 38 appeals before a recommendation on reimbursement can be made.</p><p>Since 1 September 2017, some 1,421 patients have been approved for the reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by the GP.</p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.</p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies.  This advice has been re-issued recently, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website. </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>This reimbursement decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

In these circumstances they are unlikely to be under the care of their keepers. Accordingly, any identification document issued in respect of the animals will not be available immediately.</p>  <p>  Where, at the point of seizure, a microchip cannot be detected in an equine, it is not possible to determine the identification status or food chain eligibility of that animal.  The absence of a microchip does not necessarily render an equine unidentified as microchips are required only for equines identified with a passport from 1 July 2009 onwards. </p>  <p>  EU legislation governing the identification of equines is Commission Implementing Regulation 262/2015 (CR 262/2015), as transposed into national law via S.I. 62 of 2016. </p>  <p>  S.I. 62 of 2016 requires that an application for an equine passport must be made within 6 months of the recorded date of birth of the equine.  CR 262/2015 provides that all equines must be issued with an identification document (passport) recording the number of the approved microchip implanted into the equine by a private veterinary practitioner, no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the animal.  Identification documents issued after that time must be in the format of replacement/duplicate documents which must be stamped to irrevocably exclude the related equines from the food chain. </p>  <p>  CR 262/2015 endeavours to protect the food chain and public health in ensuring that only those equines eligible for the food chain are slaughtered for human consumption.

Evidence from the local authorities indicates that the majority of horses seized under the Act are not microchipped and while owners of seized horses are given five days to reclaim their horses, very few are in fact reclaimed.  The legislation governing equine identification  provides that all equines must be identified with a passport no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the animal; there is no requirement for equines identified prior to 1 July 2009 to have a transponder implanted. </p><p>The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 places an obligation on all those in charge of an animal to meet the animal&rsquo;s needs.  Horses impounded under the Control of Horses Act are often in a very poor state and invariably have not been identified by their owners.  Taking DNA samples from these animals for testing would be a prohibitive cost to the taxpayer and has limited value in the absence of an existing library of DNA samples against which to compare.  </p><p>The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) advises all horse owners to adhere to the legal requirement for all horses to be identified and in possession of a valid passport and reiterate that it is the responsibility of horse owners throughout the country to ensure the welfare of horses in their care.

The PMG has met each month since September 2017 and has considered six months of pricing data trends.  The PMG has indicated that, in the vast majority of cases to date, prices have remained stable.  Detailed data on the price offerings for the three months December, January and February is available on www.dccae.gov.ie </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is also currently conducting a separate study on the operation of the household waste collection market which it will complete in 2018. </p>  <p>  The results from the PMG are being monitored, and in conjunction with the study being undertaken by the CCPC, will provide an evidence base for future decisions in relation to the need for further regulation of the waste market.​</p>  <p>  In terms of environmental requirements, the charges applied should encourage householders to divert waste from the residual or general waste bin.  For example, it would be expected that charges for the general waste bin would be higher than charges, if any, applied to the recycle bin.</p>  <p>  The Government has funded a range of measures to support better recycling and reduce contamination of waste in an effort to improve quality - which will in turn facilitate the development of indigenous recycling - including:</p>  <p>  - a national, standardised list of items that can go into the recycle bin has been established, which is available at http://recyclinglistireland.ie/; </p>  <p>  - this standardised list has been supported by a public education campaign run by the regional waste management authorities, comprising radio advertisements, social media, billboards/posters, etc., to promote the new list; and, </p>  <p>-   a &lsquo;master recycling&rsquo; programme, also run by the regional waste management authorities, in partnership with environmental NGOs, to roll out 650 workshops across the country training recycling ambassadors to bring the recycling message and understanding to a wide variety of communities; </p>  <p>  Almost all paper and plastic packaging is governed by EU internal market and packaging legislation.  In that context, as Minister, I have called on the European Union to urgently consider collectively banning single-use plastic items on foot of the EU Plastic Strategy to further protect the environment and to help alleviate the impact of the decision by China to restrict its intake of recyclable waste.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have also provided Government funding to support and encourage better separation of waste through a number of initiatives such as: </p>  <p>  - the Stop Food Waste programme www.stopfoodwaste.ie, which is implemented under the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s National Waste Prevention Programme and is aimed at both householders and businesses, providing comprehensive information about the food that is wasted and how to prevent this, and, </p>  <p>  - the development of a website www.brownbin.ie to provide the public with the information required to use the organic bin appropriately, including advice on the optimal methods for effective collection and storage of food waste.</p></reply>

Under the EU Packaging Directive, Member States cannot impede the placing on the market of packaging which is fit for purpose. </p>  <p>  Repak is the approved producer responsibility compliance scheme for packaging in Ireland and is tasked with meeting recovery and recycling targets established under the EU Packaging Directive.  Repak charges fees to its members in accordance with the amount and type of packaging they place on the Irish market.  These fees are used to subsidise the collection and recovery of waste packaging through registered recovery operators across Ireland.</p>  <p>  Repak members pay fees based on the amount of packaging they place on the market; this incentivises them to reduce packaging where possible and in so doing to reduce their fees.  To assist members to optimise their packaging, Repak employ packaging technologists who work with their member companies. </p>  <p>  A lot of work is being done by Repak members to prevent and minimise the amount of packaging they require.  However it should also be noted that packaging is there for a reason and sometimes even a small decrease in packaging leads to a large amount of product waste and as a result there is no net reduction in resources used.  This is a particular concern for retailers as they try to minimise food and other product waste at their stores.</p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.  Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.  This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.    </p>  <p>  The premises referred to by the Deputy is in an AMBER area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  It is therefore included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP.</p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now in its final stages. </p>  <p>  In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

In preparing the study, Dublin City Council and the NTA reviewed the current and future transportation needs of the City Centre, and the report noted that as the economy continues its recovery and employment rises, without positive intervention, increased congestion and longer journey times on the key routes to Dublin City, and within the City Centre itself, will become an increasing feature of the City.  The report also acknowledged that with the introduction of the Luas Cross City Project, Luas trams would be caught up in traffic congestion, and that the service reliability would be prone to disruption due to general traffic.  Similarly the report also acknowledged the impact to the reliability of the bus network given the interaction with other road traffic.  The report recognised that a rebalancing of the available road space will be required on various streets to facilitate the introduction of additional capacity for public transport, cycling and walking.  Significant changes to the traffic network in the City Centre will be necessary, with the objective of guaranteeing that the overall transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times.  </p>  <p>  NTA and DCC, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city with the objective of guaranteeing that the overall transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times.  As the Deputy is aware, the City Council's College Green Plaza proposal is currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for determination, and if approved, would remove a lot of the conflicting traffic movements that currently exist in College Green.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, as Minister for Transport I have ensured that Budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for a multi-modal public transport investment programme between 2018 and 2021.  The 4 year envelope will allocate investment fund projects such as BusConnects, MetroLink, DART expansion, will continue investment in Dublin's light rail network, cycling and walking and traffic management measures in our capital and beyond.  These programmes will be implemented by the NTA which has statutory responsibility for development of Public Transport in the GDA. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Government&rsquo;s Public Transport investment priorities are also set out in the recently published National Development Plan (NDP).  The NDP seeks to protect the quality and value of the existing assets and  deliver a multi-modal public transport network that will provide high-quality passenger interchange points, which facilitate convenient transfer between efficient and integrated public transport services.  All the planned investment in public transport combined will add greatly to the choice and experience of the travelling public, connecting more people with more places and ease congestion in Ireland&rsquo;s cities.  </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  I announced the 2018 regional and local road allocations on 29th January and all grant funding available to my Department has now been allocated.  Donegal County Council has been allocated &euro;33 million approx.  The base grant allocation has increased by close to &euro;3 million from the 2017 initial allocation and in addition &euro;10 million is being allocated this year to assist Donegal with works related to the severe flooding event last summer.  It is for the Council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme, taking available grant funding and its own resources into account.  </p>  <p>  In December 2017 Donegal County Council contacted my Department seeking a contribution to the estimated &euro;3 million road infrastructure costs related to facilitating the Irish Open Golf Tournament.  In response my Department notified Donegal County Council that unfortunately, given the competing demands for funding and the continued need to try to restore funding for maintenance/rehabilitation programmes along with funding a limited number of improvement projects under the Capital Plan, the Department would not be in a position to provide funding over and above Donegal's annual road grant allocation to assist with the works proposed on the access roads to the Irish Open Golf Championship in 2018. </p>  <p>  In this context my Department's approach in such circumstances is to allow the relevant local authority to make whatever adjustments are needed to its restoration programmes arising from works associated with Irish Open Golf Championship.  However, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Sport Ireland are providing &euro;500,000 each to support the Irish Open in Donegal this year as part of a three year government-sanctioned deal.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Educational Welfare Service of Tusla (EWS) that the current funding criteria and parameters are outlined in the Retention Plan Guidance Notes and accompanying planning templates.  I attach at Appendices 1-4 these documents for the information of the Deputy.  Each of the 124 SCP projects submit a Retention Plan annually to secure their project allocation for the next funding period.  Tusla requires financial returns twice in the funding period and an annual return at the end of the funding period to ensure that allocations are appropriately expended and outcomes achieved.  In this instance the Retention Plan for the South Clondalkin School Completion Programme was developed by the Local Management Committee.</p><p>The EWS has advised that the current funding criteria outlined in the attached Retention Plan Guidance Notes and accompanying planning templates apply equally to projects with DEIS and non-DEIS schools included in their clusters.</p></reply>

Application forms are also made available on request in alternative formats, including audio and braille.  The design and layout of each application form must also have regard to the particular requirements of the individual scheme or payment and ensure that the form captures all of the information required to assess and process the application.  The content and layout of application forms is reviewed regularly to ensure they are kept up-to-date and that they comply with our plain English principles.</p><p>The Carer&rsquo;s form has recently been redesigned.  This new form will allow carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide, with an aim to providing Deciding Officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement.  The Changes to the form have been finalised following consultation with Family Carers Ireland and carers representatives.</p><p>Whilst no specific training is proposed for carers to assist them in completing application forms, my Department provides a range of supports to assist carers, and other customers who may require further information or experience difficulties in filling out a form.</p><p>First, the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.welfare.ie</i>, is the central repository of information on all of the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services.  It is clearly laid out and complies with accessibility guidelines to ensure that all users, including those using assistive technologies, can easily access information and services.</p><p>In addition, the Department's Carer&rsquo;s Section and the Department's general enquiry facilities can assist a person who wishes to enquire about their potential entitlement, or clarify certain elements of an application form.  In order to further improve accessibility of information and services for all customers, my Department will continue to explore additional channels of communication, including the use of video content, where appropriate.</p><p>The Department also operates a nationwide network of Intreo centres and branch offices.  In larger offices there is staff dedicated to providing information and explaining the Department's schemes and services available, and to provide assistance to customers to enable them to access their full entitlements or indeed help those who need assistance in filling in a form.</p><p>Furthermore, the national network of Citizen Information Services also provides key advice, information and assistance to customers seeking such on my Department&rsquo;s schemes or indeed who need assistance in filling in a form.</p><p>In addition, regular formal information sessions for customer representative groups, are used as a means of communicating new information on schemes, as well as providing an opportunity to consult and receive feedback on proposed announcements, changes and communication strategies.  This is an important source of customer feedback and an opportunity for a variety of customer groups and representatives to engage with us.</p><p>In line with my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that members of the general public are fully aware of the welfare supports and services available to them, the Department run various external information campaigns to increase general public awareness of the schemes and services available.  Advertising is targeted appropriately through the best mix of media to ensure that the Department&rsquo;s messages reach the target customers.  Such campaigns are complimented by the Department&rsquo;s social media presence and attendance at various national events and information talks to provide alternative mechanisms for customers to contact the Department in a face-to-face setting.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include activation supports such as Community Employment (CE), T&uacute;s and Local Employment Services (LES).</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  There has been a 48% fall in the numbers on the Live Register who are more than 1 year unemployed in the five years since the end December 2012.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment. </p><p>Schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, they are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.</p><p>Following the publication of my Department&rsquo;s Report, <i>An Analysis of the Community Employment Programme</i>, in April 2017 the Government approved a number of changes to the terms and conditions around participation on CE.  These changes were implemented from 3 July 2017.  The main purpose of these changes was to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people who can take part - including reducing the entry age to 21 - giving a second opportunity to people who have already taken part, and securing the number of places at existing levels.  Overall, these changes improve the way that CE operates and should allow access to more people who are long-term unemployed.  If any scheme is experiencing particular recruitment difficulties, they should contact their local Intreo Centre for assistance.</p><p>T&uacute;s, the community work placement initiative introduced during 2011, was set up to provide short-term, work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  This initiative is being delivered through the network of 47 local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Recent changes have also been implemented to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the numbers available for this scheme.  This includes an increase in the percentage of assisted referrals from 20% to 30%, as well as permitting someone who has had a break of up to 30 days on the Live Register in the past 12 months to be considered eligible for T&uacute;s selection. </p><p>In 2018, the Department has contracted for the provision of LES in 26 locations with 22 contractors through a network of offices and outreach clinics.  The funding and total value of these contracts for the provision of the services has been continually maintained over the years, both through periods of economic downturn and in more recent years where again we have seen a welcome reduction in the unemployment rate.  The increased capacity provided through Intreo and JobPath and the reduction of the live register means the LES can now focus on offering an enhanced service to jobseekers.  The number of new registrations with the LES rose from 16,704 in 2016 to 20,545 in 2017.  </p><p>I will continue to keep this whole area under review so that these schemes provide real and valuable support to both individuals and communities. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In recognition of the crucial work undertaken in rural communities under the scheme, and as part of the social welfare budget package for 2018, I announced an additional 250 places to be rolled out this year together with an increase in the weekly rate of payment for participants from week beginning 26 March 2018.  Taking into account the 500 additional places already allocated as part of the social welfare budget 2017, this brings the total number of RSS places to 3,350, nearly 30% of an increase in the last two years.</p><p>In the context of administrative costs for 2018, it should be noted that all 35 Implementing Bodies (IBs) will receive increased funding in 2018, compared to 2017, due to the provision of increased RSS places.  My Department endeavours to monitor its budgets and relative spending closely and effectively to ensure that funding provided is realistic and fair for all concerned.  This also applies to administrative costs borne by the Department.  A budget of &euro;51.04m is provided for RSS in 2018.  The provisional outturn in 2017 on RSS was &euro;44.4m.</p><p>I would like to reiterate that the Government strongly supports the work being done through the RSS and the vital role such schemes are playing in local communities, including supporting social services, across the entire country. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through the Pathways to Work Strategy 2016-2020, to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people. </p><p>To date, these policies have been effective in increasing youth employment and reducing youth unemployment.  </p><p>The number of young people in jobs rose from 197,000 on average in 2012 to 235,000 in 2017. </p><p>Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 12.6% in February 2018 and now lies significantly below the EU average (16.1%).

Under the Youth Guarantee process case officers engage with unemployed young people, on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes, which are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market.<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.

The work of the URSG concentrated on whether the optimal model would be one which would be mandatory for all workers currently without supplementary retirement savings or one which would automatically enrol those without supplementary retirement savings, whilst allowing individuals to opt out should they so choose.  </p><p>The URSG comprised of Assistant Secretary level representatives from a range of Departments/Agencies and included experts from the UK Department for Work and Pensions and the OECD.  The URSG met as a full group on 6 occasions during 2015.  The Group did not publish a report but rather presented conclusions to an Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Pensions in January 2016.</p><p>In undertaking its work, to facilitate input from and engagement with sectoral interests, the URSG consulted with consumers and advocate groups, the pensions industry and with employers and employee representatives.  This included an &lsquo;Invitation for Submissions&rsquo; which was issued to approximately 35 industry/employer/trade union/consumer and advocate groups.  Representatives of the URSG subsequently met with many of the sectoral interests to discuss the submissions received and allow further articulation of views.  Officials also engaged with a range of overseas experts and officials with an experience in delivery of similar pension reforms internationally.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government recently launched its <i>&lsquo;Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023&rsquo;.  </i>Strand 2 of the Roadmap relates to<i>'Building Retirement Readiness&rsquo;  </i>and confirms the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop, and begin the implementation of, a State sponsored supplementary retirement savings system.  This system will see workers automatically enrolled into a quality assured savings vehicle.  They will make personal contributions from earnings and also receive financial support from employers and the State, whilst they will retain the right to opt-out should they so choose.  Plans for &lsquo;automatic enrolment&rsquo; have been informed by the work undertaken by the URSG and the Roadmap details the steps that will now be taken to provide that workers can be enrolled into this new system by 2022.  Government decisions relating to the organisational structure and detailed design of the system will be made after a national consultation process on automatic enrolment which will begin in quarter 2 of this year.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This sub-group is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>Persons granted international protection status (refugee status or subsidiary protection status) can access State provided supports and services on the same basis as Irish nationals.</p><p>Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for housing support through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.  Once a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.  This includes determining whether it is appropriate to refer a household for Homeless HAP Place Finder services. </p><p>The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service operating in the Dublin local authorities, and in Cork City Council, is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies.  The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 2,000 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme.  A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017. </p><p>In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation, since January 2018, the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service has been made available in each of the 31 local authority areas.  All local authorities are now being provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP scheme. </p><p>To qualify for these specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988.  The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder Service, is a matter for each local authority.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query, the Irish Red Cross (IRC) has been mandated by the Department of Justice and Equality to assist with the delivery and provision of accommodation and integration supports under the IRPP.  In Autumn 2015, the Irish Red Cross was tasked by Government with managing voluntary pledges of accommodation, goods and services from the Irish public.  This includes the IRC deploying migration volunteer coordinators across the country in county hubs including through IRC branches and volunteer members.  The IRC is working together with each of the local authorities to coordinate the local responses. </p><p>There are a number of ways in which a programme refugee might have their housing need met under HAP: in private rental accommodation with HAP support from Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres, with assistance of IRC or other non-governmental agencies; in private rental accommodation with HAP support from Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres, by sourcing their own accommodation; or in a pledged property using HAP support, under the normal conditions of the HAP scheme. </p><p>In summary, arrangements are in place at local authority level across the country to support the identification of units and housing for programme refugees, including through HAP.  In addition to the availability of Homeless HAP in situations where the local authority determines the household as homeless, the additional co-ordination measures outlined above are intended to support and assist families into suitable accommodation for their needs. </p><p>Such housing solutions are being funded from the &euro;6 billion approved by Government under Rebuilding Ireland over the period 2016-2021.  It should be noted that a range of other supports are also being made available at local level to support the integration of the families concerned into their new communities. </p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an<i></i>independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.</p><p>The Act provides that landlords must apply to register the tenancy of a dwelling with the RTB within one month of the commencement of the tenancy.  The RTB actively pursues landlords for non-registration.  Failure to register tenancies can result in prosecution with fines of up to &euro;4,000 and/or six months imprisonment.</p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Shared Service Centre (SSC) provides a highly effective transactional service on behalf of Local Authorities, including data-sharing with the RTB in relation to active HAP tenancies.  This enables the RTB to ensure compliance with the national tenancy registration system.</p><p>The 2004 Act applies to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions.  The dwellings to which the Act does not apply are set out in section 3(2) of the Act.

This legislation requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.  Under the 2009 Act, a household is defined as a person living alone, or two or more persons, who in the opinion of the local authority concerned, have a reasonable requirement to live together.</p><p>As such, it is a matter for each local authority to decide on the type of support to be allocated to individual households.  As Minister, I am precluded by the 2009 Act from intervening in relation to the procedures followed, or decisions made, by local authorities in the allocation of particular dwellings.</p><p>In addition to traditional local authority housing, social housing support is also provided through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme. Under HAP, local authorities will make a monthly payment to a landlord, subject to terms and conditions including rent limits, on a HAP tenant&rsquo;s behalf.  In return, the HAP tenant pays a weekly contribution towards the rent to the local authority.  This &lsquo;rent contribution&rsquo; is based on the household income.  It is calculated in the same way as the rent paid by a tenant of a local authority owned property.</p><p>HAP provides fast, flexible housing support to households in an area of their choice. Individuals with a housing need who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP, avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent.  There are currently more than 34,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP.</p><p>Under Rebuilding Ireland, I have made it clear to local authorities that the delivery of social housing supports must be focussed on and consistent with housing need as measured by the now annual Summary of Social Housing Assessment (SSHA) process.  Given that the largest percentage of households in need of support are now single person households, this clearly means that the provision of one and two-bedroom dwellings has to be increased in many locations in the coming periods.  My Department is working actively with local authorities to increase these types of dwellings and the recently published guidelines for apartments will also help in this regard.</p><p>The implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is well underway and significant progress is being made.  This was evident in the Social Housing Output indicative figures published in January 2018, showing that nearly 26,000 households had their social housing need met in 2017.</p><p>It should be noted that the targets set under Rebuilding Ireland were carefully set against the reality of deliverables.  Of the overall target of meeting the needs of 137,000 households by 2021, just under 45,000 households have had their social housing need met by the end of year 2 of the Plan, some 33% of those targeted.  More details can be accessed through the <i>Social Housing Delivery 2017 Report</i>(January 2018), which is available on my Department's website at link: </p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

The response to the brief period of flooding was led by Donegal County Council and supported by a range of agencies.  Although the flooding event ended quickly, considerable efforts were undertaken, again led by Donegal County Council with the support of relevant agencies and Government Departments, to clean up and restore infrastructure and to assist those affected by the floods.</p>  <p>  Funding for repair of public infrastructure is undertaken by the relevant Department(s) in line with sectoral responsibilities.  Each Government Department liaises directly with local authorities in relation to funding of repairs and restoration being carried out through the local government system.</p>  <p>  Since 2009, my Department has made financial support available to assist local authorities in meeting the costs of clean-up and necessary immediate works associated with significant severe weather emergency events.

It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.
