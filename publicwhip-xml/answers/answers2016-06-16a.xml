The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county, including County Tipperary.</p><p>The county breakdown for the National Broadband Plan Intervention in Tipperary is set out in the following table, with the percentage of premises to be covered by the Intervention and through commercial investment also listed. <table><tr><th>County Name </th><th>Total Number of County Townlands</th><th>Number of Premises Covered by National Broadband Plan Intervention </th><th>% Premises within the NBP Intervention Area </th><th>% Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area </th></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>3,167 </td><td>41,207 </td><td>49% </td><td>51% </td></tr></table></p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for  the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum. Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to qualifying bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

However, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change, with migration towards electronic communications resulting in significant core mail volume decline year-on-year.  However, post offices, having being fully computerised some years ago, also stand well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector for both electronic transactions as well as the more traditional over the counter transactions.</p><p>In recognition of the changing commercial environment my predecessor established the Post Office Network Business Development Group last year, the remit of which was to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the Post Office network.  Mr Bobby Kerr was appointed as the independent Chair of the Group and he brought a depth of knowledge and experience in identifying and developing business opportunities for the post office network. </p><p>The Final Report of the Group, which was published in January of this year, represents an important step towards greater financial sustainability for the Post Office and the wider network and specifies 23 recommendations with Network Renewal, Basic Payment Account and Motor Tax being the three key actions arising from the Final Report.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to acting on all of the recommendations of the Final Report including supporting the implementation of a Basic Payment Account and enabling the payment of motor tax through the post office network.  My officials have been actively engaging with other Departments and agencies on these issues over the past six months.</p><p>Responsibility for implementation of the recommendations in the Final Report will shortly transfer to the Minister for <font color="#222222">Regional  Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.</font></p></reply>

The Government has adopted a range of support measures designed to meet our binding target, and although good progress towards our target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. Provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates we had reached 9.2% of the overall 16% target at the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  In the electricity sector the primary support mechanisms introduced for renewable electricity are the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) schemes and the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  These schemes have proved successful at incentivising the development of the renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to meet our 40% renewable electricity target, and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) estimate for 2015 is that 25.3% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources.</p>  <p>  In the heating sector, my Department is working on the introduction of a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) to support the deployment of renewable energy in the sector.  The primary aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in heating and to help reach our 12% target by 2020. In 2015 it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  In the transport sector Ireland aims to meet our renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  In 2015, 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper, Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future, published in December last, sets out a vision for transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050.  The clear focus of my Department is on implementing the range of actions set out in the White Paper that are aimed at meeting our energy and climate change targets.</p></reply>

The EU Commission reports that 91% of households in rural areas can access broadband in this manner, and on that basis Ireland is ranked 19th of the EU member states compared.</p>  <p>  When measured in a technologically neutral manner, including both wired and wireless broadband subscriptions purchased by households, Ireland is however ranked 9th  highest for households which subscribe to a broadband service at 83%, of which 65% use a fixed line access path.  The overall penetration of 83% in Ireland compares to an EU average of 80%. </p>  <p>  The focus is now on fast tracking the roll out of high speed services through the National Broadband Plan (NBP).  The Government&rsquo;s NBP intervention will ensure the availability of quality future proofed broadband services to all other parts of the country. </p>  <p>  This Plan aims to ensure that high speed broadband will be available to all citizens and businesses.  The Plan will deliver on targeted areas by leveraging investment from both private and public sectors. </p>  <p>  Over 750,000 premises are the focus of the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ('PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016. </p>  <p>  The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders, following the assessment of responses to the PQQ stage.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract(s) which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht. Once contract(s) are in place, I expect to publish a detailed rollout plan for the network.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once contract(s) have been awarded.</p>  <p>  In addition to the NBP, improvement in access to digital services in Ireland is also being achieved through digital literacy training, which is provided nationwide under the BenefIT Programme funded by my Department.</p></reply>

ComReg is accountable directly to Committees of the Oireachtas for its exercise of the function.</p>  <p>  In the case of EU roaming charges, the European Parliament and the Council have most recently adopted EU Regulation 2015/2120.  The Regulation follows on previous EU Roaming Regulations to impose further reductions in the maximum permitted retail roaming charges within the EU, with the objective of abolishing such charges from June 2017.  </p>  <p>  In the period of EU regulation, the maximum permitted wholesale roaming charges, exclusive of VAT, have fallen significantly.  The per minute charge for an incoming call has reduced from 24 cent to 0.0114 cent and for data downloads from &euro;1 to 5 cent per megabyte downloaded.  The EU Commission is currently examining proposals to further reduce wholesale roaming charges to ensure the planned abolition of retail roaming charges within the EU from 2017 is sustainable over time.  This is good news for European consumers and I look forward to the eventual abolition of all roaming charges across Europe. </p>  <p>  I have no statutory authority to intervene in the EU Commission&rsquo;s role in proposing EU wide regulated wholesale roaming charges nor the exercise by ComReg of its statutory authority to set regulated mobile termination rates in the domestic market.</p></reply>

The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg and accordingly I have no statutory function in this matter. </p>  <p>  I am aware however that licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.  The design of the network is a matter entirely for the operator concerned although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons.

I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

It is a problem solving court and makes an important contribution, not least as an alternative to prison.  The Drug Treatment Court operates on the basis that a criminal matter has not proceeded to formal conviction and the presiding Judge reviews matters at each adjournment, frequently over an extended period of time, to assess progress, before the matter before the Court is eventually finalised.  Once on the programme, participants receive a lot of help and support from the team that supports the Drug Treatment Court including an education coordinator, a liaison nurse among others in dealing with the challenge of tackling their addiction.</p><p>The review of the Drug Treatment Court was completed in January 2013 by the Support and Advisory Committee for the Drug Treatment Court<b>, </b>whichcomprised representatives of each of the agencies involved with the Court, and the Report on the Review of the Operation of the Drug Treatment Court was submitted to the then Minister.  The desire of all agencies was to increase the number of participants in the programme and so the catchment area served by the Drug Treatment Court was significantly expanded in July 2013 to encompass the whole of County Dublin and the programme has also found a way to facilitate participants from outside of Dublin, with participants from Portlaoise and Cork being admitted in 2015.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group included a recommendation in relation to a Community Court and the implementation of the Group's recommendations, including a community justice intervention which developed from the community court recommendation, is being progressed in the Department and is being closely monitored by an oversight group led from outside the Department.  There will also be a focus on the Drug Treatment Court as part of the Programme for Government's commitment to commencing implementation of a new National Drugs Strategy within the next 12 months.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 30 April 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 314 members and 18 Garda Reserves assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  A detailed breakdown of these members is in the table.  All Divisional resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU), the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and 11 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division to date.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years<font color="#000080">.</font></p><p><b>CAVAN/MONAGHAN Garda Division 30 April 2016</b><table><tr><th>District</th><th>Station</th><th>GD</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>SU</th><th>CS</th><th>AC</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>BAILIEBORO</td><td>29</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYJAMESDUFF</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COOTEHILL</td><td>6</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINGSCOURT</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MULLAGH</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHERCOCK</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>VIRGINIA</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>BAILIEBORO</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>50</td><td>11</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYBAY</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRICKMACROSS</td><td>30</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEBLANEY</td><td>23</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROCKCORRY</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>CARRICKMACROSS</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>57</td><td>16</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ARVA</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINAGH</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYCONNELL</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BELTURBET</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLACKLION</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAVAN</td><td>52</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DOWRA</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLESHANDRA</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILNALECK</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SWANLINBAR</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>81</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONES</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EMYVALE</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>56</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SCOTSTOWN</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>62</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DIVISIONAL TOTAL</td><td>250</td><td>55</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td>314</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These include the provision of accommodation, access to health and education services and the provision of social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  A dedicated resettlement support worker is employed in each individual county where programme refugees are being resettled at present.  The worker's role is to support programme refugees in terms of accessing services and settling into their new communities.</p>  <p>  A language training and orientation programme provided by the local Education and Training Board continues to be available to programme refugees for a year after they are housed in a particular community.</p>  <p>  Refugees arriving in Ireland under the Refugee Resettlement programme are afforded programme refugee status upon their arrival in Ireland.  These refugees are eligible for social welfare payments on the same basis as Irish citizens and are entitled to apply for relevant social welfare weekly payments such as basic supplementary welfare allowance, jobseeker's allowance, one parent family payment, state pension and child benefit appropriate to the circumstances of the individual or family.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme can make exceptional needs payments to help meet essential costs.  This scheme is available to persons with refugee status.</p>  <p>  Exceptional needs payments made to refugees while in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres are largely granted towards clothing costs, transport costs and the purchase of child related items such as prams/buggies.  Exceptional needs payments are also paid to support their move from the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres into the community, including assistance towards rent deposits.  Applications are determined on a case by case basis having regard to the individual circumstances presented.</p>  <p>  In addition to the payments referred to above, the Department of Social Protection also provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when children start school each autumn.  This scheme is available to families with refugee status.</p>  <p>  I will ensure that all the cases raised will be investigated further, I have an official in Cork today, and an update will be provided.</p></reply>

A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the review of this case issued to the person to whom the Deputy refers in November last year.  The recommendation made by counsel was that I should take no further action in this case and the person was informed of the reasons for that outcome.  While I appreciate that it may be difficult for the person in question to accept that, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality I do not have the authority to review Garda investigations or decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions nor do I have the authority to initiate criminal investigations or prosecutions.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated entity. The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, if the firm who bought the loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm then the firm must either become regulated themselves or the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is now the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of credit servicing firms. Credit servicing firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including the various codes mentioned above and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).</p>  <p>  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have:</p>  <p>  -  Robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance;</p>  <p>  -  Agreements with loan owners that enable the credit servicing firm to fully comply with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation; and</p>  <p>  -  Adequate and effective control of loan servicing in the State to enable Central Bank oversight. </p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 also includes a statutory obligation on an authorised credit servicing firm not to perform any action that a regulated lender would not be allowed to do. This additional protection seeks to ensure that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale.</p>  <p>  The Government's commitment on this issue is underlined by the Programme for a Partnership Government which provides that "To reflect the growing public concern regarding credit servicing firms and other property firms we will ask the Central Bank and the Oireachtas Committee on Housing to examine the legislation introduced last year that ensured that borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale. We will provide greater protection for mortgage holders and tenants and SMEs whose loans have been transferred to non-regulated entities ('vulture funds')." This is a Year 1 Action in the programme.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, it was forecast in Budget 2016 that overall tax revenues for this year would grow by 5.8 per cent to approximately &euro;47.2 billion and were profiled on that basis.  As part of its earlier preparations for the Stability Programme Update, the 2016 tax revenue forecasts were reviewed by my Department in the context of their performance against profile year-to-date.</p>  <p>  On the basis of developments to the end of March 2016, it was decided not to revise the tax revenue forecast, as overall receipts were only 1.1 per cent (&euro;119 million) above profile at-end Quarter 1.  Income tax and VAT, which are expected to account for just over two thirds of the total take yield in 2016, were marginally below profile. Income tax finished the quarter down &euro;153 million (3.4 per cent) and VAT was down &euro;193 million (4.7 per cent) respectively against target.</p>  <p>  Excise duties and corporation tax performed strongly during the first quarter of 2016, up &euro;114 million (8.1 per cent) and &euro;305 million (87.3 per cent) respectively against profile.  However, it should be noted that the Revenue Commissioners had informed my Department that the over-performances were been driven by specific issues, some of which are expected to "unwind" as the year progresses.  For example, in relation to excise duties there has been a significant front-loading of tobacco stocking in advance of the commencement of the plain packaging initiative. Meanwhile, the over-performance in corporation tax to the end of March was wholly attributable to a number of large unexpected payments from a small number of companies, which could be repaid over the course of the year.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that since the Stability Programme Update 2016, tax revenue performance has been strong and at end-May 2016, receipts were up &euro;774 million (4.3 per cent) above profile, which represents a 9.0 per cent (&euro;1,549 million) increase when compared to same period in 2015.  This solid performance is being reviewed as part of the upcoming Summer Economic Statement 2016.</p></reply>

In line with these provisions, we have established a credible medium term budgetary framework that ensures our fiscal planning follows a multiannual perspective. Furthermore, as required under the 'Two Pack' reforms, our macroeconomic forecasts, which underpin both the annual budget and Stability Programme Update (SPU), are assessed and endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p>  <p>  The Government will be publishing the Summer Economic Statement shortly.  This will represent the first opportunity to publish our medium-term fiscal plans since the Government was formed.  The forecasts in the Statement will reflect the tax and spending priorities set out in the Programme for Partnership Government.</p>  <p>  The SPU submitted to the European Commission in April was completed before the formation of the current Government. For this reason, it was prepared on a purely technical no-policy change basis. This is the accepted practice in circumstances where elections are underway or governments remain to be formed in post election circumstances. Accordingly, prior to the formation of the current Government, there were no policy decisions in place on the use of the fiscal space for the coming years. As the use of the fiscal space, for example on expenditure, tax reductions or improving the general government balance, has major impacts on multiannual forecasts, it could not be reflected in the SPU projections.</p></reply>

This analysis confirmed that since 2008 corporation tax payments have been heavily concentrated among large companies, particularly multi-nationals, and that this concentration has increased over time, demonstrating that the exporting multinational sector performed better during the recession than the domestic sector and SMEs generally.  The overall policy conclusions reflected on the concentrated level of Corporation Tax receipts in general and how this creates a policy challenge in Ireland.</p><p>Another more recent example of is in Budget 2016, where my Department highlighted the risks that underpin the concentration of Corporation Tax receipts.  This time, the risks specifically related to the forecasting of Corporation Tax receipts, and noted that company specific factors could have large implications for the overall Corporation Tax yield.</p><p>On the most recent increase in Corporation Tax receipts, the Revenue Commissioners recently undertook and published their analysis, which can be viewed at the following link: <i>.</i></p></reply>

These ensure we are at, or are on the adjustment path towards our medium term objective of a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP.  </p>  <p>  Under the expenditure benchmark one-off developments such as the Allied Irish Banks related transaction are not taken into account when calculating this measure.  In relation to the structural balance, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's recently published Fiscal Assessment Report states that an over-performance in tax revenue in 2016 could secure compliance with this rule given current expenditure plans.</p>  <p>  Separately, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Pascal Donoghue T.D. recently announced a proposal to increase the 2016 voted expenditure by &euro;540 million to allow targeted increases to support the delivery of key services in the Health Sector and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As outlined in the April Stability Programme Update, increases of this order can be provided while continuing to deliver against the key fiscal targets.</p>  <p>  These extra spending plans will be incorporated into the forthcoming Summer Economic Statement which will be published by my Department later this month.

The EU fiscal rules essentially seek to ensure sensible and sustainable budgetary policies, taking into account the impact of the economic cycle.  For the purpose of assessing compliance with the fiscal rules, a Commonly Agreed Methodology (CAM) has been developed, which in essence seeks to assess the cyclical position of the economy, and on that basis, the appropriate fiscal policy stance for Member States, including Ireland.  My Department's forecasts are prepared in a way which is consistent with the CAM, as required in the context of the European Semester.</p>  <p>  As noted in the 2016 SPU, the CAM is subject to limitations particularly when applied to Ireland.  Efforts continue at European level to improve the applicability of the CAM.  As I have outlined in a recent parliamentary question reply (Ref 15737/16), my Department is in the process of developing alternative models for estimating potential output.  Considerable work has been done on this front and is now nearing completion.  An outline of this work is set out in Box 1, page 24, of the 2016 SPU, published in April.  The intention is to publish the technical work in the short-term.  However, I would stress that for the purposes of assessing the cyclical position of the economy in the context of the fiscal rules, the CAM is still the relevant metric. </p>  <p>  I would also emphasise that both myself and my Department remain vigilant to signs of overheating.  Consideration is given to a wide range of indicators, which include, but are not limited to, estimates of the cyclical position of the economy.  My Department has not currently detected signs of overheating over the forecast horizon.  Moreover, there are indications of spare capacity in the economy, particularly in the context of the labour market.  Having said that, it is clear that with continued strong growth in the economy, the amount of spare capacity is declining and we must be conscious of this.</p>  <p>  The Government, for its part, will not pursue budgetary policies to overheat the economy.  Our emphasis is on continuing to implement sensible policies, including budgetary policies, aimed at ensuring sustainable growth and public finances.</p></reply>

However, the CBI also stated that it would dispose of the government bonds as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit.  This position remains unchanged.  Due to improved financial stability conditions, the disposals of fixed and floating rate government bonds from the Special Portfolio have been faster than the minimum.  However, any decision to accelerate sales cannot be permanent or predetermined by the CBI as the sales programme must be able to adjust to market conditions taking into account the views of the NTMA regarding the management of the State's interest rate risk, the market absorption capacity, the State's general issuance programme and target maturity profile as well as the financial impact.</p></reply>

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products.  The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.</p>  <p>  The question of the cost of insurance is a complex one involving a number of Government Departments, State Bodies and private sector organisations and while the provision and the pricing of insurance policies is a commercial matter for insurance companies, this does not preclude the Government from introducing measures that may, in the longer term, lead to a better claims environment that could facilitate a reduction in claims costs.</p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on a review of policy in the insurance sector which is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments and Agencies.  The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.</p>  <p>  The first phase of the Review is focussed on the motor insurance compensation framework and this work is nearing completion.  The next phase of the Review involves examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  Work on the Review of Policy in the Insurance sector will continue over the coming months.</p>  <p>  I would also add that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  In the event that a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland, 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1, Telephone +353 1 6761820 quoting the Declined Cases Agreement. </p></reply>

The National Debt is the net debt incurred by the Exchequer after taking account of cash balances and other financial assets.  Gross National Debt is the principal component of GGD.  GGD also includes the debt of central and local government bodies.  GGD is reported on a gross basis and does not net off outstanding cash balances and other related assets.</p><p>Much of the information on GGD that the Deputy is seeking is available in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) published in April of this year.  The published GGD figure for 2015 is  &euro;201.3bn, 93.8% of GDP, at an average interest rate of 3.3%.  Further, Figure 4 on page 22 of the 2016 SPU, illustrates the maturity profile of long-term marketable and official debt as at end-March 2016 by facility type.</p><p>Details of the composition of General Government debt, its residual maturity and average interest rates as at end-2015 are set out in the table.<table><tr><th>General Government Debt as at end December 2015</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Instrument</td><td>Outstanding</td><td>Weighted Average residual maturity</td><td>Weighted Average Interest rate</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;bn</td><td>Years</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Government Bonds</td><td>125.1</td><td>11.6</td><td>3.9%*</td></tr><tr><td>EU-IMF Programme**</td><td>49.7</td><td>12.1</td><td>2.2%</td></tr><tr><td>State Savings ***</td><td>16.7</td><td>***</td><td>0.83% - 2.26%</td></tr><tr><td>Other Medium and Long-Term Debt</td><td>1.2</td><td>11.5</td><td>4.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Short term debt</td><td>3.9</td><td>0.19 (71 days)****</td><td>-0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Other general government debt</td><td>4.6</td><td>*****</td><td>*****</td></tr><tr><td>Total general government debt</td><td>201.3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sources: NTMA, CSO</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>Rounding may affect totals. National Debt figures for end-December 2015 take account of the effect of currency hedging transactions. </p><p><i>Notes:</i></p><p>* This is the nominal interest rate which differs from the yield at issue.</p><p>** A prepaid margin of &euro;0.53 billion was deducted from the EFSF loan of &euro;4.19 billion drawn down on 1 February 2011 giving a net liability of &euro;3.66 billion.  The total net liability of &euro;49.75 billion at end-December 2015 takes account of this reduction.  EFSM loans are subject to maturity extensions designed to bring the original weighted average maturity to 19.5 years.  It is not expected that Ireland will have to refinance any of its EFSM loans before 2027.  However as the revised maturity dates of individual EFSM loans will only be determined as they approach their original maturity dates, the weighted average maturity figure above does not reflect the maturity extensions.  Including certain assumptions for EFSM maturity extensions, the residual weighted average maturity of EU-IMF Programme loans was close to 14 years at end-2015.  The EU-IMF Programme interest rate is an estimated weighted average, euro equivalent interest rate.</p><p>*** State Savings Schemes also include moneys invested by depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) which does not form part of the National Debt but is part of other General Government Debt in the table above.  These funds are mainly lent to the Exchequer as short-term advances and through the purchase of Irish Government Bonds.  Taking into account POSB Deposits, total State Savings outstanding were &euro;19.5 billion at end-December 2015.  State Savings include products with original maturities ranging from 3-10 years.  These products generally have a very high re-investment rate.  Irrespective of the original term, NTMA State Savings products can be encashed on demand at any time repayment takes 7 days.  Prize bonds can be encashed when 90 days have elapsed after the purchase date.  The interest rates are the maximum interest rates (AER) payable on the fixed term fixed rate products available for purchase at end 2015.  These rates were changed in June 2016.</p><p>**** The table shows the weighted average maturity and interest rate on short term paper which includes Euro Commercial Paper, Exchequer Notes and Central Treasury Notes. </p><p>*****The balance of GGD includes debt of Local Authorities, the Housing Finance Agency, non-commercial semi-state bodies, voluntary hospitals, and the HSE.  This category also includes consolidation adjustments in respect of debt, including bonds, held by General Government entities.</p></reply>

It sets out a process called the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).</p><p>The MARP is a four-step process which lenders must follow: Step 1: Communicate with the borrower; Step 2:  Gather financial information; Step 3: Assess the borrower's circumstances; and Step 4: Propose a resolution.</p><p>As part of step 2 of MARP, a lender must use the prescribed standard financial statement (the SFS) to obtain financial information from a borrower in arrears or pre-arrears.  The lender must provide the borrower with the SFS at the earliest possible opportunity and offer to assist the borrower with completing the SFS.  </p><p>The completion of affordability assessments is a key step in the MARP - (Step 3).  In this regard a lender must examine each case on its individual merits and it must base its assessment on the full circumstances of the borrower, including, inter alia, the information provided in the SFS.</p><p>In June 2015, the Central Bank published the outcome of a themed inspection of lenders' compliance with the CCMA.  This is available at:</p><p>As part of this theme seven lenders were inspected under 4 keys area.  The Themed review found that while all of the lenders had implemented frameworks as required by the CCMA, weaknesses of varying degrees were identified across a number of lenders as well as a number of good practices.  One of the areas examined was in relation to the resolution of arrears in a timely manner and delays were identified in passing a copy of the completed SFS to the lenders arrears support unit (ASU) for assessment and the ASU assessing the SFS once received.  All lenders that were subject to the CCMA themed inspection have provided responses to the issues raised with them.  The Central Bank of Ireland continues to engage with these lenders as part of their on-going supervisory engagement to ensure compliance with the CCMA. </p><p>Lenders generally use the Insolvency Service of Ireland's reasonable living expenses as a basis for their own policy for living expenses.</p></reply>

Following this investigation the Central Bank determined that it had reasonable grounds to suspect that Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS) had committed certain prescribed contraventions and that certain persons who were concerned in the management of INBS at the relevant time participated in the commission of those suspected prescribed contraventions.  As regards the corporate entity INBS, that process concluded when a settlement was agreed in 2015 in which all of the prescribed contraventions were admitted by INBS and the maximum applicable fine of &euro;5m was imposed on INBS but this was waived by the CBI on public interest grounds. </p>  <p>  Civil proceedings against Michael Fingleton are underway in the Courts and are at discovery stage, I am advised by the Special Liquidators that no further comment can be provided on this matter at this juncture.</p></reply>

However, Section 7 (3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000 provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.  Schools that comply with the requirements of the equality legislation do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.</p>  <p>  It is my view that the desire of parents for diversity in education choice can be provided effectively by focussing on the delivery of the ambition to treble the number of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools as set out in the Programme for Government.  This commitment is to deliver a total of 400 non-denominational and multi-denominational schools by 2030.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to publish new School Admissions legislation taking account of current draft proposals and addressing issues including publication of school enrolment policies, an end to waiting lists, introduction of annual enrolment structures, and transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents.</p>  <p>  In terms of any advices sought on repealing the provision of the Equal Status Act referred to by the Deputy, the Deputy will be aware that the previously published draft legislative framework for school admissions did not propose any such change to the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which was published in April 2015 did not progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas and was not reinstated for the current D&aacute;il session.  However, I have commenced a process of consultation with opposition parties to discuss my proposals to introduce a new Admissions Bill to make the process of enrolling children in school easier for parents.</p>  <p>  Following these consultations, it is my intention to publish a new Admissions Bill during the current D&aacute;il session.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that 80% of schools are not oversubscribed.  The new Bill will oblige all schools to admit pupils where there are available places.</p></reply>

However, in an open market , it is a matter for the collector to set charges, including service charges, at the level they consider to be competitive, in compliance with the requirements of environmental and other applicable legislation.  Excessive pricing by individual companies will offer the opportunity for rival operators to provide their services at a cheaper price.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I intend to meet with waste industry representatives this week to discuss the transition to pay by weight charging.</p>  <p>  Given that the charging systems are moving to a more standardised format across the country, householders should be able to more easily compare the charges of different providers under the new system and choose the option that suits them best or is most cost effective.

At this stage, only a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households, and with the qualification criteria and level of support varying from area to area.</p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country. </p>  <p>  There is no indication from areas where pay-by-weight charging has already been implemented that there has been increased evidence of dumping.  Notwithstanding the above, and while enforcement action against illegal waste activity, including dumping, is a matter for the local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as appropriate, my Department has introduced a number of measures to strengthen our efforts to combat illegal waste activity generally. </p>  <p>  Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) have been established in each of the three existing waste regions with responsibility for coordinating waste enforcement actions and ensuring consistent enforcement of waste legislation while still leaving local authority personnel as first responders on the ground to specific breaches of waste legislation. This will facilitate a transformation from process driven enforcement, structured around separate implementation of individual regulations, to one that focuses greatest effort on the waste problems and issues that matter most and to take swift, proportionate and effective action.</p>  <p>  The work of the WERLAs is being supported by continued funding provided by my Department for the local authority waste enforcement network. Some &euro;8.2 million is being provided in 2016 for the retention by local authorities of 155 specialised waste enforcement officers, critical to tackling issues such as illegal dumping in local communities and in providing an enhanced response on the ground to infractions of the waste code.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, under the new pay-by-weight regulatory regime, local authorities will be establishing a register which records the details of households which are using the services of an authorised waste operator (whether a kerbside collector, pay to use compactor or civic amenity facility).  In gathering these details from service providers, local authorities may use this information to target households which appear not to be managing their waste correctly or using the services of an authorised operator and these data will support a number of awareness, education and enforcement programmes already initiated by individual local authorities.</p></reply>

This substantial funding over 2014/15 supported local authorities to deal with a backlog of vacant social housing units and that support is continuing into 2016.</p>  <p>  Funding support of up to &euro;30,000 per social housing unit is available under the programme.  The average cost of the works carried out in 2015 was just over &euro;12,000, which reflects the fact that vacated social housing can be in need of varying levels of refurbishment. In addition to the 5,000 housing units referred to, many other vacated social houses are repaired and re-let by local authorities without drawing on Departmental funding.  Such houses are repaired as part of the normal maintenance work that local authorities carry out continuously on their social housing stock.  There is no requirement for local authorities to hold a social house in a vacant state for a specific period before drawing down funding support from my Department and, in fact, local authorities should carry out works on all such housing units as soon as possible and re-let them without delay.</p>  <p>  There will always be a low level of vacant social housing stock, with the number of such units nationally changing daily, as would be expected in the management of thousands of homes by local authorities where tenants move in and out all the time.  The feedback from local authorities is that rates of vacant units are now as low as 1-2% in many cases and the build-up of vacant units prior to 2014 has been substantially addressed via the investment in 2014/15.</p></reply>

These are 5-year rolling programmes prepared and published by each local authority for the provision of Traveller accommodation in their areas.  These programmes are subject to comprehensive local stakeholder and public consultation, including members and representatives of the Traveller community.  In parallel, the composition and terms of reference of the working group to be established under the Programme for Government commitment will be scoped by the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC), which comprises key stakeholders including representatives of the Traveller community, and submitted to me for consideration.  This is in accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 which provides, inter alia, that the NTACC may advise the Minister on general matters concerning the preparation, adequacy, implementation and co-ordination of traveller accommodation programmes.  The independent review commissioned by the Housing Agency will provide factual information and a key platform for the working group to progress its work effectively.</p><p>While the timing of the finalisation of the work of the working group will be dependent upon its terms of reference and work programme, I will be mandating the group to complete their report in the earliest time possible.</p></reply>

PPPs are tailored to a person&rsquo;s individual requirement so the customer will be referred to appropriate supports such as EmployAbility.</p>  <p>  A caseworker working with a person with a disability can arrange access for that client to most of the range of services and programmes that are available to people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments.  This includes access to programmes such as JobBridge, First Steps, Back to Education Allowance, and SOLAS training for unemployed people.  Exceptions include the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy, the Momentum training intervention and T&uacute;s, all of which were specifically designed for long-term recipients of jobseeker payments.</p>  <p>  In addition a person on Disability Allowance has the option of participation in Community Employment(CE).  Eligibility requirements for people with disabilities are not as demanding as for other job seeker groups so as to encourage participation.  Those on job-seekers&rsquo; payments generally must be aged over 25 and on a payment for a year or more.  Effectively a person in receipt of DA who is aged 18 or over can be in receipt of their payment for 1 week and be eligible for CE.</p>  <p>  EmployAbility, provides a supported employment service to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the open labour market.  This service provides a range of supports, through 23 EmployAbility companies, on behalf of the DSP include the services Job Coaches who provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides, through the Wage Subsidy Scheme, financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 21 hours per week.  An employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and is based on the number of hours worked, giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on 39 hour week.  This payment is not time-limited and is paid for the full period of employment of the individual concerned.</p>  <p>  Moreover my Department provides a range of employment supports for people with disabilities through the The Reasonable Accommodation Fund for the Employment of people with disabilities, comprising the Workplace Equipment and Adaptation Grant, the Personal Reader Grant, the Job Interview Interpreter Grant and the Employee Retention Grant.</p>  <p>  A further scheme available through my Department, the Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme, provides funding so that employers can buy in Disability Awareness Training for their staff.  The purpose of the training is to deliver clear and accurate information about disability and to address questions or concerns that employers and employees may have about working with people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies, for the Deputy, the comprehensive range of supports available from my Department.</p></reply>

A 75% Bonus was paid last December to some 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients, including pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and the long-term unemployed, in recognition of their financial dependence on their social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  The cost of a 50%, 75% and 100% Bonus is estimated to cost approximately &euro;133 million, &euro;200 million and &euro;267 million respectively.  It should be noted that these costings are subject to change over the coming months in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for December 2016.</p>  <p>  There is no provision in 2016 Revised Estimates for the payment of a Christmas Bonus.

The Government continues to work closely with all relevant stakeholders in this regard.</p><p>A quarterly review process, originally established under the Stormont House Agreement of December 2014, now also takes account of the Fresh Start Agreement.  These review meetings track the progress on the implementation of these agreements.  They are convened by the Irish and UK Governments with the appropriate participation of the political parties in Northern Ireland.  The last review meeting was held on 14 January 2016 involving both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I, as well as the leadership of the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP and the Alliance. Following the completion of the election cycles, North and South, the next review meeting on the Agreements is currently being scheduled.</p><p>Overall, there has been a good start to the implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement with each administration undertaking the necessary work to fulfil its commitments.</p><p>Together with the Minister for Justice and Equality, I hosted a trilateral ministerial meeting on enhancing law enforcement co-operation on the island, as envisaged by the Fresh Start Agreement, in Farmleigh on 21 December 2015.  This meeting, which included the two Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, also launched the Joint Agency Task Force on cross-border crime.</p><p>Just before Christmas, the Executive appointed Monica McWilliams, Lord Alderdice, and John McBurney as its three-person Panel to develop a strategy on paramilitarism, as envisaged in the Fresh Start Agreement.  The Panel&rsquo;s report on the disbandment of paramilitary groups was published by the Northern Ireland Executive on 7 June.  The Panel&rsquo;s recommendations will now inform the development over the coming weeks of an Executive Strategy aimed at putting an end to the scourge of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland.  In addition, the drafting of the necessary international agreement between the two Governments to establish a four person body to monitor progress on ending paramilitarism is also underway.</p><p>The Government is also meeting its financial commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement.  Discussions at senior official level are underway with the Northern Ireland Executive regarding co-operation on infrastructure projects, including the A5 motorway, the Narrow Water Bridge and the Ulster Canal.  The Government&rsquo;s committed funding of &euro;2.5 million to the North West Development Fund has been provided and will be matched by the Executive.</p><p>The Executive and the British Government are also proceeding with implementation of their respective commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement.  The Executive signed off on the 2016-17 Budget last December and the Welfare Bill implementing the relevant provisions in the Agreement passed into UK law on 25 November 2015.  The UK Treasury also recently approved the release of monies from the Stormont House Agreement funding to support integrated education.  <b></b></p><p>The institutional reforms provided for under the Fresh Start Agreement have also been implemented, including the reduction in the number of Executive Ministries from 12 to 9 and the option for parties entitled to a place in the Executive to instead designate as part of the formal opposition in the Assembly.  This option was taken up by both the UUP and the SDLP following last month&rsquo;s election.</p><p>With regards to the establishment of a framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement but on which final agreement could not be reached during last year&rsquo;s Fresh Start talks, the Government remains committed to the full implementation of these commitments. </p><p>Over the last number of months, officials from my Department have met with a range of victims&rsquo; groups from across the affected communities, to hear their perspectives on how best to establish the legacy institutions and to listen to their views on possible solutions to outstanding issues.  These consultations proved very valuable and will inform my approach to seeking an agreement on the outstanding crucial issues, including finding the appropriate balance between information disclosure and safeguarding national security.  </p><p>Since my reappointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have already had conversations with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and some party leaders on the urgency of now re-engaging on these outstanding issues.  The recent developments in regard to the Kingsmill and Loughinisland massacres, as well as the new policing investigation being launched on the &ldquo;Stakeknife&rdquo; allegations, demonstrate once again how imperative it is to secure agreement on the establishment of dedicated institutions for dealing with the toxic legacy of the past.</p><p>In the weeks and months ahead, I will therefore be continuing my active engagement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties with a view to securing an overall agreement on dealing with the legacy of the past which is vital both for individual victims and survivors and for society as a whole.</p></reply>

Compliance with this requirement is assessed in two ways. Firstly, until the MTO is reached, a minimum annual improvement in the structural balance greater than 0.5 per cent of GDP is required.  The second pillar for the assessment is compliance with the Expenditure Benchmark.</p>  <p>  The expenditure aggregate used in the Expenditure Benchmark is calculated as general government expenditure excluding debt interest, cyclical unemployment benefit spending and certain spending on EU co-funded programmes.  A smoothing adjustment is also applied in relation to expenditure on capital formation.  The estimates of fiscal space set out in Table A.8 of the Budget 2016 book, published by the Department of Finance in October last year, are based on application of the Expenditure Benchmark and consequently factor in these adjustments to calculate the Expenditure Benchmark expenditure aggregate.</p>  <p>  As regards revisions to the expenditure ceilings, as set out in the Expenditure Report 2016, the 2016 ceiling for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was revised.  This upwards revision took account of an increased allocation for expenditure on the EU co-funded Rural Development Programme.</p></reply>

Its aim is to help filmmakers to make Irish films, and provide production and development loans for features, television programmes, animation projects, documentaries and short films.  The Film Board also helps to promote individual films, the Irish film industry as a whole, and Ireland as a film location.  My Department has allocated &euro;14.471 million to the Film Board in 2016.  Film making in Ireland is also supported by the Section 481 film tax credit system, which incentivises investment in film making in Ireland.  This incentive was enhanced in Budget 2016 when the cap for eligible expenditure on film projects was increased from &euro;50 million to &euro;70 million.</p><p>It should also be noted that the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a very important commitment to progressively increase funding for the arts over the lifetime of the Programme, with specific reference to the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming estimates and budgetary processes. </p></reply>

All employees including medical staff are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy. Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer. Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare. This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.</p>  <p>  Last November the Government gave its approval to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents. This will be included in the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill which is well advanced. The legislation is part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events. </p>  <p>  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential. The intent of this legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure. This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs. The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure.  </p></reply>

The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  Pricing contracts are purely a matter for agreement between the NTPF and the nursing home in question.  The Department of Health has no role in such individual negotiations.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of everyday living; and</p><p>- Laundry service.</p><p>Additional charges may not be levied in respect of the above components of care.  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in this contract.  The Department of Health are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through  the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p></reply>

Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  In order to be eligible to apply for the Scheme, an applicant must be ordinarily resident in the State.  This means that they are living in the State for at least a year or intend to live in the State for at least a year.  This statutory-based Scheme replaced the scheme of the Nursing Home Subvention which had been in existence since 1993, and the system of contract beds and long-stay charges in public nursing homes.</p>  <p>  Any person who was supported in a private nursing home before the commencement of the NHSS in October 2009 could choose to transfer to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or retain their existing subvention arrangements.  Any person who was in a public or voluntary nursing home or in a contracted bed in a private nursing home before the commencement of the NHSS, likewise could continue with their existing arrangements.  The National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme states that nothing in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 or in the National Guidelines shall operate in a way that diminishes the overall financial position of an applicant in receipt of Nursing Home Subvention, or who is currently in a public nursing home bed, including contract beds.</p></reply>

It was first commercialised in the mid 1970&rsquo;s and is registered worldwide.  Its uses incorporate agriculture, forestry, industrial, home and garden, and semi aquatic areas.</p>  <p>  A decision on renewal of the approval of glyphosate for use in plant protection products placed on the market in the EU is due to be made by 30 June 2016.  The issue has been discussed by Member State representatives at meetings of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed held on 7-8 March 2016 and 18-19 May 2016. A vote has not been taken yet on the EU Commission proposal for renewal of approval.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s draft proposal is based on a very extensive evaluation performed by Germany and peer reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Member State experts.  The EU peer review process was comprehensive and rigorous and was specially extended to allow for detailed consideration of the report produced in 2015 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organisation.  Following the extended peer review, EFSA concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans.  This conclusion was supported by 27 out of 28 Member State toxicology experts, and is in line with the conclusions of other regulatory agencies around the world, including those in Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States.</p>  <p>  My Department considers that the EU peer review process for glyphosate has clearly identified safe uses and that the regulatory proposal presented contained appropriate measures for implementation by Member States to address concerns that have been raised.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the legal basis for the appropriate chemical hazard classification of glyphosate in Europe, including its carcinogenic potential, will be provided by an assessment overseen by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which is due to begin later in 2016 and run for 18 months.</p>  <p>  Ireland has supported Commission proposals for renewal of approval for Glyphosate.</p></reply>

Over 80% of applicants in this second tranche of GLAS opted to do so, and with the funding available were approved.</p>  <p>  As the application by the person named was ranked as a Tier 3 application it was not selected into the scheme.</p>  <p>  A third tranche of GLAS (GLAS 3) will open later this year and the person named and any applicant who was unsuccessful in the second tranche will have the opportunity now to re-examine their proposed farm-plan, in consultation with their advisor, and see how it might be improved to increase their chance of selection under GLAS 3.

At this point the project is focused on the feasibility, scoping, costing and the consent preparation stages of the project.  Until these stages are suitably advanced it will not be possible to make any definitive decision on whether or not this project will proceed.  A sum of &euro;2.5 million has been provisionally allocated for this purpose as part of the Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme 2016.</p><p>Killybegs has been attracting increasing levels of fishing, commercial cargo and cruise liner activity and a need has been identified, supported by key stakeholders for additional berthage. The proposed project would provide an additional 120m of sheltered berthage to a depth of -0.9m Chart datum in Killybegs FHC.  In addition to facilitating the increased activity it would also enable relocating larger fishing vessels from the Blackrock Pier to the new berthage area.</p><p>The project would include the dredging of a quantity of silt, gravel and rock. In 2016 the first phase of the project includes a comprehensive site investigation and detailed design which when completed will give an estimation of final project costs, of course this will only be ultimately determined by market forces following a competitive tender process. No final decision to move the project to works phase has been made at this time.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres including this one are subject to available exchequer funding and competing priorities and a final decision to go to works will be made in that context.</p><p>A chemical re-evaluation of the sediments was carried out in 2015 and early 2016, as part of the current development proposal. Results currently indicate that at least 85% is suitable for disposal at sea, subject to EPA approval.</p><p><b></b>My Department intends to submit a Dumping At Sea Application to the Environmental Protection Agency as part of this project in the coming months.  Any material that is determined to exceed the environmental standards set for sea disposal will not be dumped at sea.  Other options are being considered should this arise, including disposal on land or other remediation measures.  The issue of disposal of quantities of contaminated dredge spoil is a matter which is regularly encountered in marine dredging works.  A variety of appropriate solutions exist to address such situations.</p></reply>

It is clear at this point, however, that there is no prospect of securing the agreement of a qualified majority of member states, or the EU Commission, to such an increase.  However, I very much welcome the announcement by Commissioner Phil Hogan of his intention to increase the flat rate ceiling for SMP intervention buying-in up to 350,000 tonnes, following my recent meeting with him.  SMP Intervention is key EU support tool for dairy markets and is badly needed in this extended period of downward price volatility in the dairy sector.  Intervention helps to put a floor under prices and this extension will be of particular benefit for Irish producers through the peak production period.  Other measures agreed at EU level include Aids to Private Storage for Cheese and a targeted direct aid scheme of &euro;13.7 million for Irish farmers, which was matched by national funds. </p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the pressures on dairy farmers right now and I am committed to working with all players in the sector to address these issues and ensure that we have a sustainable dairy sector going forward. In this regard I have called a meeting of the Dairy Forum for next Tuesday 21st June with all stakeholders to discuss the relevant issues. </p>  <p>  I can assure the deputy that I will continue to engage with the EU Commission and with other Member States to ensure that market support measures are deployed and extended as necessary.</p></reply>

Ultimately the volume and value of trade depends on relative commodity prices, global supply, currency exchange rates trade and other factors.  US consumption of beef is estimated at 11 million tonnes, approximately 1 million of which is imported.  The potential prize for Irish operators is therefore, subject to the variables already outlined, very significant, particularly in circumstances where grass fed hormone free beef is gaining traction in the market place.  Ireland received a major reputational boost in 2015 as the first EU Member State to gain access to the US market for beef.  This was opened to Irish exports in January 2015 and six plants are approved to export. As with any new market, it takes time to build reputational brand and a customer base, and the real time to assess its value is when these are bedded down. </p>  <p>  In volume terms, by the end of December 2015 the figures for exports of beef from Ireland to the US had risen to an estimated 1,800 tonnes which would have an approximate value of &euro;11.5 million.  This represents an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export in September.     </p>  <p>  In Quarter 1 of 2016 approximately 700 tonnes with a value of &euro;6 million are estimated to have been exported to the USA, continuing the positive trends from last year. The trade is currently confined to the market for intact cuts, but we are currently seeking approval to export manufacturing beef/Beef Intended for Grinding (BIFG). My Department is engaging with the US authorities on a regular basis to extend the approval for beef in this way. </p>  <p>  US beef prices have fallen back from the peaks recorded in the early part of 2015, and the relatively high prices available for beef in Europe in 2015 meant that US buyers may have been priced out of the market as Irish exporters chose to send product to more valuable markets in the UK and on the continent. </p>  <p>  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international markets for Irish beef. My Department continues to push strongly for market access to other Third Countries and we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including, inter alia, China, Korea, Israel, Ukraine and   Vietnam. It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global marketplace.</p></reply>

The model instrument aims to help ease access to finance for farmers and other rural businesses.  Member States and regions can adapt and use this model to set up financial instruments funded by their rural development programmes (RDPs) under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).  No such funding has been allocated by the EIB or under Ireland&rsquo;s RDP to date. </p><p>I am considering including Financial Instruments (FIs) in Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme.

It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources for such instruments.</p><p>In order to include a FI as a measure in the RDP an Ex-Ante Evaluation is required by EU regulation and therefore my Department will, in the near future, invite tenders for the carrying out of such an assessment.  This tender will also look at the provision of a FI under the European Maritime Fisheries Fund Operational Programme.</p><p>The Ex-Ante Assessment can take between 3 months to a year to complete.  It includes a range of steps and must assess:</p><p>1.  Market analysis &ndash; need to prove that FIs are required due to investment gap.  This gap must be quantified.</p><p>2.  Estimation of value added of FIs</p><p>3.  Estimation of public and private resources to be raised</p><p>4.  Reflection on lessons from other instruments</p><p>5.  Development of a proposed investment strategy (i.e. choice of instrument) and description of the advantages and disadvantages of different types of financial products</p><p>6.  Discussion about how results will contribute to RDP objectives</p><p>7.  Revision and updating of the ex-ante assessment in the case of changing market conditions. </p><p>Once the Ex-Ante Assessment is done, an agreement must be reached between my Department and any other potential stakeholders/financial institutions on a clear investment strategy that is developed from the gaps, if any, identified in the Ex-Ante Assessment.

The rules governing the EU milk quota regime, including the super levy system for production above quota, were set at EU level and it is not within the gift of individual Member States to amend the rules.  However at the request of Ireland and some other member states the EU Commission introduced a provision last year permitting payment of the levy in three annual instalments, without interest, on the understanding that the full amount of the levy was paid to the Commission by the Member State in 2015.  The Scheme required applicants to pay at least one third of their levy by October 2015 with the balance to be paid in 2016 and 2017.  Ireland was one of the few Member States to implement this scheme and make it available to its farmers.  The scheme design was agreed in advance with the co-ops and farm organisations here.</p><p>As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.  I also raised the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan, in our recent bilateral meeting, as well as at the recent Council of Ministers meeting and encouraged him to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in super levy repayments for farmers.  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.  While Ireland has again raised the matter with the Commission, we understand that the view of its legal services remains that there is no legal basis for any adjustment to the timelines provided for in the relevant regulations.</p><p>I would like to reassure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the pressures on dairy farmers right now and I am committed to working with all players in the sector to address these issues and ensure that we have a sustainable dairy sector going forward.  As one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum my goal is to ensure that it continues to work constructively as a vehicle for addressing issues of concern to farmers and others in the sector and I have called a meeting for next Tuesday 21 June.  The Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving cash flow planning at farm level, which will be rolled out shortly.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of applicants</th><th>Deferred Super Levy &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>69</td><td>497,908</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>122</td><td>1,224,985</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>30</td><td>272,251</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>920</td><td>8,465,299</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>31</td><td>782,527</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>9</td><td>133,636</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>78</td><td>961,368</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>146</td><td>1,933,785</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>55</td><td>506,313</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>387</td><td>2,892,722</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>192</td><td>1,584,850</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>3</td><td>20,724</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>166</td><td>1,678,143</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>23</td><td>203,038</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>54</td><td>697,015</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>5</td><td>59,233</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>170</td><td>1,757,945</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>66</td><td>883,001</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>87</td><td>853,049</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>2</td><td>17,953</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1</td><td>54,869</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>436</td><td>4,273,994</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>292</td><td>2,217,157</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>59</td><td>830,780</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>266</td><td>2,158,123</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>72</td><td>627,021</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>3741</td><td>35,587,689</td></tr></table></p><p>Being paid in 10 equal amounts - 5 payments in 2016 and 5 payments in 2017.</p></reply>

While the precise cost of purchasing statistical transfers or any potential shortfall in Ireland's target of 16% has yet to be established and will depend on a number of factors, the focus remains firmly on meeting our 2020 targets.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority. This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Wexford.</p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for  the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum. Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to qualifying bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded. </p></reply>

The PSO levy supports a number of schemes designed to facilitate the Government's electricity policy objectives for renewables, indigenous fuels and security of supply.  It also supports employment in the renewables industry and in the peat industry.</p><p>The calculation of the level of the PSO is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which has published a consultation on a proposed levy of &euro;441 million for 2016-2017. This is an increase of 36% on the levy amount for 2015/2016. The proposed levy amount for  2016-2017 equates to &euro;79.48 per annum for domestic consumers, &euro;279.48 per annum for small business customers and &euro;44.94/kVA per annum for medium to large businesses.  The biggest drivers for the proposed levy increase are the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price and increased deployment of renewables.</p><p>Of the proposed levy total, &euro;137.7 million will be used to support electricity generated by peat-burning plants with a capacity of 250 MW. The indicative support for renewable electricity generation in 2016/2017 is &euro;334.1 million.  This will support over 2,500<font color="#FF0000"> </font>MW of renewable energy, including onshore wind, offshore wind, biomass, anaerobic generation, biomass landfill gas and biomass combined heat and power.  The vast majority of supported renewable generation is wind power. It should be noted that the recently published PSO Levy paper is a proposed decision and is open for consultation until 27 June 2016. In accordance with its statutory obligations, the CER will publish the final PSO Levy Decision before 1 August 2016.</p><p>Recent international studies have shown that Ireland has had one of the lowest per unit supports for renewable energy in the European Union</p><p>Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the CER, which is an independent statutory body. CER also carries out statutory market monitoring functions, has the responsibility to ensure that the market operates competitively for the benefit of the consumer, and accredits price comparison sites where energy consumers can assess prices and identify significant savings. </p><p>The competitive energy market results in choice for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices, exerting downward pressure on prices. As the wholesale electricity price is falling, this should be passed onto electricity customers and this will mitigate the proposed levy increase in the current period. In this regard I am pleased to see that some electricity suppliers have recently reduced their price offerings in the domestic sector. Domestic customers can also avail of discounts available, either by contacting their supplier directly or by using accredited websites to switch to discounted tariffs.</p></reply>

There has however, been a positive increase in the level of petroleum exploration activity, in particular acquisition of new seismic data and the award of 28 new Licensing Options under the 2015 Atlantic Margin Licensing Round. It is important that this activity translate into an increased level of exploration drilling in the coming years, if Ireland&rsquo;s true petroleum potential is to be realised.</p>  <p>  In a similar manner, while the number of active mineral prospecting licences, currently in excess of 500, indicates the positive prevailing state of mineral exploration in Ireland, no new commercially viable deposits of minerals have been discovered in recent years. While there have been some encouraging results, particularly in County Limerick, it is too early to determine whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits.  </p></reply>

The Government has adopted a range of support measures designed to meet our binding target, and although good progress towards our target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  Provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates we had reached 9.2% of the overall 16% target at the end of 2015.    </p>  <p>  The potential of the bioenergy sector to make a significant contribution in this regard is well recognised.  My Department is in the process of finalising a bioenergy plan to capture this potential through the development and introduction of measures to encourage the growth of Ireland&rsquo;s biomass and bioenergy sectors.</p>  <p>  In relation to Electric Vehicles (EVs), the Electric Vehicle grant support scheme, introduced in April 2011, provides supports of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new EV.  Electric vehicles are also exempt from Vehicle Registration Tax of up to &euro;5,000 and, where technically feasible, customers who qualify for the grant also qualify for a free domestic charge point installed by the ESB.  To date, grant support has been provided for the purchase of 1438 new vehicles.  In addition, work is underway to establish a  task force, as set out in the Programme for Government, involving relevant government departments, agencies, industry and representative groups, to further examine the potential for the take-up of electric and other low emission vehicles. </p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement. </p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband services.  This investment is expected to continue with further services being rolled out over the coming years, in the BLUE area on the High Speed Broadband Map.  These services include fibre-to-the-cabinet, fibre-to-the-home, cable and fixed wireless services, which are comparable to services offered in other jurisdictions.  The Department continues to monitor this commercial deployment  </p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  The procurement process to build a network in this area commenced in December 2015 and is ongoing.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.  Members of the public can scroll through the map, enter their Eircode and see whether there premises is in a BLUE or AMBER area. The Department also has a dedicated mailbox for queries in relation to the map - broadband@dcenr.gov.ie</p><p>The Intervention Strategy available at http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/communications/en-ie/Pages/Publication/Ireland's-Broadband-Intervention-Strategy-update.aspx sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of <i>at least </i>30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload, available 99.95% of the time.  Together with other detailed technical specifications, these will ensure that a reliable fast service is available to consumers.  In addition to these requirements, bidder(s) will be asked to put forward:</p><p>-  Minimum speeds for businesses;</p><p>-  Proposals to future-proof the network to meet ongoing demand for bandwidth. To this end, the winning bidder(s) will be subject to period reviews on a 3-5 year basis.</p><p>-  Minimum speeds for businesses;</p><p>I am satisfied that the speeds are sufficiently high to meet consumer demand, and any network build will have to be capable of scaling up to meet future demand.  The 30mbps target will be minimum speed rather than a ceiling for consumers.</p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for  the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum. Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to qualifying bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month. The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

It is subject to a requirement to secure access to the required radio spectrum by way of licence. The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg.</p>  <p>  I am aware that licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.  The design of the network is a matter entirely for the operator concerned although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons. ComReg monitors compliance with licence requirements by means of bi-annual drive tests.  I understand that current testing is designed to cover all primary and secondary national routes, with measurements being performed on all Mobile Networks.</p>  <p>  Neither I nor my Department has any role or responsibility in the monitoring of coverage or the quality of service being provided by licenced operators.  With respect to the status of mobile telephony in other countries, comparisons between Member States, including neighbouring jurisdictions, can be  problematic due to the unique national characteristics of individual markets, including topography, population density, frequencies used etc.  In terms of improving the quality and coverage of mobile services and broadband in all areas throughout the country, there are however various initiatives underway.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the establishment within 100 days of a mobile phone and broadband taskforce which will consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to the terms of reference for the Taskforce to ensure delivery of the Programme for Government commitment within the timelines set out. It is likely that the taskforce will involve a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with telecommunications operators.  My Department has already conducted a number of meetings with vendors and mobile operators to help inform the process and identify what tangible measures can be taken.</p>  <p>  There are several ways in which improved wireless broadband and mobile voice services can be achieved.  This includes the Government and Local Authorities working to reduce barriers to the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure through better planning laws and processes; and working with telecommunications operators to improve information on various aspects of their activities, including upgrades and changes to their networks.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and other relevant Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband services including acquiring spectrum under ComReg's 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction for rollout of 3G and 4G mobile services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are taking place. ComReg is also planning the further release of spectrum to assist in the rollout of mobile services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  In 2015, 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 as the primary means through which Ireland would meet the transport target and is the principal support for the uptake of biofuels in Ireland.  The scheme works by obligating road transport fuel suppliers to bring increasing amounts of biofuel to the transport fuel market.  Currently, the obligation rate is set at 6% by volume and will increase to 8% from 2017.  The question of further increases to the biofuels obligation rate on a phased basis will be considered in due course.  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme has seen increased amounts of biofuel used in Ireland and, in 2015, over 184 million litres of biofuels were placed on the Irish transport fuel market, of which over 15% was produced indigenously.   </p></reply>

In addition, the Programme for Government sets out a range of priority climate actions and interventions, a number of which have a direct bearing on the energy sector. In combination, these will help to increase and diversify Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy mix across the electricity, heating and transport sectors.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are a range of grant offerings available to householders who wish to upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes and therefore reduce use of fossil fuels.

Where the parties cannot agree as to the selection of an Adjudicator, an application may be made by one of the parties to the Chairperson of the Ministerial appointed Panel of Adjudicators seeking the appointment of an Adjudicator.

Late payment is particularly damaging for small and medium-sized businesses, where any disruption to cash flow can mean the difference between solvency and bankruptcy.</p>  <p>  My Department promotes improved payment practices and monitors on a quarterly basis the operation of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997 and the Late Payment in Commercial Transactions Regulation, 2012.</p>  <p>  In addition to legislating for prompt payments, since 2009, Central Government Departments have been improving their respective payment times and are now obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.  This 15 day prompt payment rule, introduced by Government on a voluntary basis, was extended to the wider Public Sector in March, 2011.</p>  <p>  Departments are required to report quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target, ensuring that Ministers can monitor the performance of the bodies under their aegis and address any issue with those bodies who are not meeting obligations in respect of prompt payments.</p>  <p>  Other initiatives introduced at national and EU level to combat this issue include:</p>  <p>  -  Launch of the Prompt Payment Code (PPC) portal in March of 2015.  The PPC, which is hosted through an online portal &ndash; www.promptpayment.ie &ndash; is a new initiative aimed encouraging and promoting best practice between businesses and their suppliers, improving cash flow between businesses and driving a change in payment culture.</p>  <p> -  Introduction in late 2015 of the Payments Forum.  The role of the Forum is to support the delivery of the Prompt Payment Code (PPC) and also examine further initiatives to sustain a responsible payment culture in Ireland.  	</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the PPC has specifically been developed by business for business.  By signing up to the PPC companies are sending out a real signal that they will stick to their payment terms.  For those with no pre-agreed payment terms, the PPC works to combat this.  For suppliers, this means they can build stronger relationships with their customers, confident that they will be paid on time.</p>  <p>  For the PPC to be successful, we need businesses to sign up.  I would, therefore, urge all business, big and small, to support this important initiative and sign up to the PPC.</p>  <p>  These initiatives, together with the late payment legislation, demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s continuing drive and commitment to encourage a prompt payment culture in Ireland.</p></reply>

It is targeted that a further &euro;3m will be leveraged with additional private sector investment to support this entrepreneurship initiative.  This Regional Accelerator Scheme was the first competitive initiative to be launched under the &euro;40m competitive regional jobs fund announced by the Government on 15 January.</p>  <p>  More recently, on June 1st last, I announced an initial allocation of &euro;5m in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives under two of these calls: the LEO Competitive Fund and the Community Enterprise Initiative.  This &euro;5m allocation will support &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; projects where:</p>  <p>  -  The Local Enterprise Offices will group together to create collaborative projects in their region (&euro;2m) and</p>  <p>  - Community organisations will partner with other regional organisations to deliver new job creation projects (&euro;3m).</p>  <p>  Further competitive regional funding calls will be rolled out on a phased basis.</p>  <p>  In the case of all competitive funding calls, a collaborative approach, tangible jobs impact, enterprise start-up and scaling are amongst the criteria against which applications will be measured.

These programmes primarily support childcare in formal settings such as preschools and cr&egrave;ches, some of which are run by community/not-for profit organisations, and some by private providers.  These include:-</p><p>-  The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme that provides after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  Eligibility for the programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school.  The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.</p><p>-  The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.  The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks.  Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>-  The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p>-  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.</p><p>There were 760 applications received for subsidised childcare places, in the programme year 2015/2016, from the Dublin North West region (identified as Dublin 9 and Dublin 11 postal districts).

It should be noted that HIQA was satisfied with the approach taken by the Child and Family Agency, Tusla and the area management to address the issues at the time of the inspection.  Tusla's commitment to addressing the issues in Louth/Meath was also evidenced in the implementation of a rapid improvement programme in the area, in addition to the normal action plan that follows an inspection.  Many of the actions listed in the action plan associated with the inspection had been completed before HIQA's report was published in June 2015.  I have requested a further update on the ongoing improvements in the area from Tusla, and I will revert to the Deputy when this is to hand.  </p>  <p>  My officials have regular meetings on a monthly and quarterly basis with Tusla management to review the overall level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.  The effect of the rapid improvement programme in the Louth/Meath area is being monitored and I am pleased to note that the figures reported from the area on the numbers of open cases allocated to a dedicated social worker show an increase from 58% in May 2015 to over 90% of cases allocated in March 2016.  </p>  <p>  Both Tusla and my Department are committed to the ongoing improvement of child protection services, including areas where specific issues have been identified.  HIQA, as an independent body, makes its decisions on the timing of inspections using a risk based approach, and it may carry out any further inspections as it considers appropriate.  Between May 2013 and May 2016 HIQA has published inspections of the child protection services in 15 of the 17 Tusla administrative areas.  Inspection reports on the remaining 2 areas are expected to be published later this year. </p>  <p>  For the information of the Deputy, I can advise that HIQA is undertaking a thematic review of the service to children and families through Child Welfare &amp;amp; Protection Services, and that the field work for this thematic review is underway.  This process will see the completion of inspections of child welfare and protection service in the remaining two administrative areas during 2016, and a review of the implementation of action taken to address HIQA's inspection findings.  This review will also examine the governance arrangements for the provision of Child Welfare &amp;amp; Protection services.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that Tusla is receiving significant additional resources in 2016.  Tusla has been provided with additional funding of &euro;38m in Budget 2016, including funding of over &euro;6 million to reduce the number of cases awaiting allocation of a social worker.  A significant recruitment programme for additional social workers is underway.  As part of its Business Plan for this year, Tusla has committed to a number of key targets to be achieved by the end of 2016.  Tusla has made progress in its targets.</p></reply>

This is as a consequence of the removal of child and family services from the HSE in 2014.  Arrangements between Tusla and the HSE for paying rent/rent contributions vary considerably nationally.  New leases for shared occupancy with the Health Services Executive have an established rate while some older leases on shared HSE leased properties require a small contribution or no payment contribution at all.  The Tusla property portfolio is currently under review.
