    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-28a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016042800036#WRA00500"><p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 57,600 people for which the Government has provided approximately &euro;267 million for 2016.  There are currently over 1,600 rent supplement recipients in county Kerry.  Properties are being secured under the scheme with over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015, of which almost 800 were in the Kerry area. </p><p>Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme came into effect from June 2013.  These rent limits were determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available at that time.  The Department used information from rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board and other data sources to inform the review process, including the Central Statistics Office Rental Indices, leading property websites and views of stakeholders.  Major population centres in each county were examined as part of this review process. </p><p>In view of the supply difficulties in the private rented market a key finding of the Department&rsquo;s most recent rent limit review was that rent supplement policy must continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits.  Copies of the Department&rsquo;s rent review reports are available on <i><i>www.welfare.ie</i></i>. </p><p>The Department has implemented a policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  This targeted approach has assisted over 7,600 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rent payments, of which 57 households are in Kerry.  A county breakdown of these cases is provided in the following tabular statement.  It should be noted that there is very limited availability of advertised properties for the private residential market in the areas referred to by the Deputy, notably Killarney and Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is. </p><p>I believe the targeted approach of the Department and the recent legislative reforms announced to the private rental sector provide a level of stability for those who require rent supplement support in what has become a highly volatile rental market.  The matter remains under close review.</p><p><b>Total Increased Rental Payments by County as at 25/04/2016</b><table><tr><th><div>County</div></th><th><div>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</div></th><th><div>Awards under protocol with Threshold</div></th><th><div>Total no. of increased payments by County</div></th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td><div>35</div></td><td></td><td><div>35</div></td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td><div>24</div></td><td></td><td><div>24</div></td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td><div>60</div></td><td></td><td><div>60</div></td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td><div>359</div></td><td><div>76</div></td><td><div>435</div></td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td><div>-</div></td><td></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td><div>3,060</div></td><td><div>1,954</div></td><td><div>5,014</div></td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td><div>166</div></td><td></td><td><div>166</div></td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td><div>57</div></td><td></td><td><div>57</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td><div>353</div></td><td></td><td><div>353</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td><div>127</div></td><td></td><td><div>127</div></td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td><div>113</div></td><td></td><td><div>113</div></td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td><div>64</div></td><td></td><td><div>64</div></td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td><div>7</div></td><td></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td><div>128</div></td><td></td><td><div>128</div></td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td><div>122</div></td><td></td><td><div>122</div></td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td><div>3</div></td><td></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td><div>301</div></td><td></td><td><div>301</div></td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td><div>61</div></td><td></td><td><div>61</div></td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td><div>25</div></td><td></td><td><div>25</div></td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td><div>-</div></td><td></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td><div>165</div></td><td></td><td><div>165</div></td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td><div>39</div></td><td></td><td><div>39</div></td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td><div>178</div></td><td></td><td><div>178</div></td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td><div>15</div></td><td></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td><div>177</div></td><td></td><td><div>177</div></td></tr><tr><td>Overall Total</td><td><div>5,640</div></td><td><div>2,030</div></td><td><div>7,670</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The assessment is based on the requirement for care arising from the disability(ies) and not on the diagnosis(es) of the person being cared for.  The requirement for full-time care is further defined as requiring from another person, continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to him or herself and likely to require that level of care for at least twelve months.</p><p>The person concerned is in receipt of CA in respect of her son since 11 September 2008.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-28a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016042800036#WRA01300"><p>Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a means tested social protection scheme.  In the case of a couple, account is taken of the means of both members of the couple and this reflects the fact that married couples, civil partners and cohabitants are financially interdependent on each other.</p>  <p>  The jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme features a range of disregards and tapering arrangements where one or both members of the couple are working.  Where, for example, the spouse, civil partner or cohabitee is in employment, the employed person can earn up to &euro;31,410 per annum (gross) before entitlement is fully withdrawn from the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claimant (assuming no other means).  In the case of a couple with two children, the equivalent figure is &euro;36,815 per annum.  The introduction of a minimum level of entitlement where, ordinarily, there is no entitlement because of the level of means of one or both of the parties would represent a significant change to the provision of means-tested payments in Ireland and would target additional resources at households not currently entitled including some higher income households.  </p>  <p>  Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claimant is aged under 25, the value of the benefit and privilege derived from living with a parent or step-parent is assessed for means test purposes.  In practice, benefit and privilege is taken to mean the value of board and lodging to applicants residing in the home of parents and the value of same is assessed by reference to a formula (with a wide range of income disregards).  The purpose of the assessment is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants who have this benefit and those who have not, and between people living in relatively better-off households and those whose circumstances are less well off. </p>  <p>  Where the claimant&rsquo;s means are in excess of the statutory rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, no payment is made.  Where the claimant&rsquo;s means result in an entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance of a rate of &euro;1 per week or less than &euro;40 per week, a minimum payment of &euro;40 per week is paid.  Accordingly, the current arrangements guarantee a minimum rate of payment where there is an underlying entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in the first instance and does not apply where this is not the case.  It should be noted, in this regard, that the assessment of the value of benefit and privilege does not imply that there is a direct financial transfer from a parent to the adult child and the current arrangements ensure that the jobseeker has access to some direct cash support. Such arrangements are not available to jobseekers who do not have an underlying entitlement to a payment because they reside in higher income parental households.  </p>  <p>  Changes to the means testing arrangements for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will be a matter for the incoming Government.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The average waiting time for new carer's allowance (CA) applications at the end of March was 19 weeks.  At the end of March, there were 5,851 CA applications awaiting decision.  The volume of CA claims on hands are a consequence of continued strong claim intake and the delays in processing are frequently caused or exacerbated by the customer failing to fully complete the claim form or failing to attach the supporting documentation that is requested on the application form.  </p>  <p>  A business process improvement (BPI) review has recently been completed for the CA scheme.  This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs. </p>  <p>  The recommendations arising from this BPI recently  have been implemented.  The Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for CA in light of the current waiting times, including the assignment of temporary and full-time staff and the facility to assign overtime working where appropriate.</p>  <p>  These measures will, lead to a reduction in the average waiting time.  The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.</p></reply>

Free travel is also available on cross border journeys to and from Northern Ireland.  Additionally, customers aged 66 years and over can travel for free on journeys within Northern Ireland.  There are currently approximately 848,000 customers with direct eligibility for Free Travel.    </p>  <p>  The Free Travel scheme is open to operators both in rural and urban areas who wish to apply to join it.  Payments are calculated on the basis of estimated fares foregone, at a reduced rate to take account of travel generated by the free travel scheme.  Operators are not reimbursed for individual journeys.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to make any changes to the free travel scheme at this time.  Any decision to extend the scheme to allow free travel pass holders to avail of local taxi services would have budgetary and operational consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-28a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016042800036#WRA02100"><p>The Pensions Act 1990 provides for all matters relating to occupational pensions, including the protection of members of pension schemes and providing for balance between the paying members, deferred members and drawing members (pensioners) of a pension scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Pensions Act, the Minister for Social Protection must make Regulations specifying the percentage which will determine the amount by which preserved pension benefit is to be increased or decreased in the revaluation year.  Making these Regulations is a legislative requirement and an obligation on the Minister and there is no discretion not to set the percentage where there has been a change in the level of consumer prices during the year.  Under these provisions, the Occupational Pension Schemes (Revaluation) Regulations, 2016 were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 8th of this month.  </p>  <p>  A person who leaves employment, and who has been a member of their former employer&rsquo;s defined benefit pension scheme, may choose to either leave their accrued pension rights in the scheme of their former employer or transfer their rights to another vehicle which can accrue pension rights.  Where the person chooses to leave their pension rights in the scheme of their former employer, they are regarded as &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; members of the scheme and legislation safeguards their rights in the scheme.  Part of this protection is ensuring that their pension value is &lsquo;preserved&rsquo; and revalued annually to keep pace with changes in the annual rate of Consumer Price Inflation.  This maintains the spending power of these pension entitlements to a reasonable level.  Deferred members are no longer contributing to the scheme and are not working for the employer.  They may be in other employment and contributing to the scheme of the new employer.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 provided for a change to amend the imbalanced situation where static or decreasing wage rates impacted on employees&rsquo; potential pension benefits but not on the value of deferred members&rsquo; pensions.  The anomaly had arisen because the annual revaluation for deferred scheme members was limited to a lower floor of 0%.  This floor was removed, and the revaluation of deferred members&rsquo; benefits now tracks both negative and positive changes in the annual rate of the Consumer Price Index.  2015 is the first time the revaluation percentage has been negative, resulting in an adjustment of -0.3% to deferred member&rsquo;s prospective pension benefits.  However, it is worth noting that since 2009, the overall change in the revaluation percentage for deferred members has been positive at 4.5%.</p>  <p>  The revaluation percentage does not remove funding from pension schemes but rather provides for a fair distribution of available resources.  It is not a levy and no income is received by the State as a result of the revaluation percentage changing. </p>  <p>  It may be noted that the regulations cater for minimum standards.  Scheme trustees, should the scheme rules allow it, are not precluded from applying revaluation rates that would be more beneficial to members where the scheme has the capacity to do so.  For example, trustees may decide not to apply the negative revaluation for 2015.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that these measures will not have any impact on former scheme members where the scheme has already wound up.</p></reply>

Accordingly, to ensure that the correct weekly payment issues, customers are required to complete a form on a weekly basis setting out the days on which they worked and the days on which they were unemployed and have this form verified by their employer.  This is normally a very quick process with the submitted dockets scanned onto the Department&rsquo;s computer system and the relevant payment calculated and issued. </p>  <p>  These arrangements can cause difficulties in a small number of cases and, in these circumstances, alternative arrangements can be put in place such as the acceptance of a signature from the employer&rsquo;s local representative (e.g. a local supervisor or manager).

It could allow employers to offer reduced gross salaries to returning emigrants, which could put existing Irish resident individuals at a disadvantage when competing for employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, there are some tax incentives which could be availed of by individuals entering the State to take up employment, including returning Irish emigrants.</p>  <p>  Such an individual could elect for "split year" treatment in the year of arrival, which involves the discounting of any non-Irish employment income for tax purposes where it was earned before an individual permanently moves to Ireland.  In broad terms, an individual is entitled to split year treatment where they enter the State and become resident at some time during a tax year, with the intention of remaining and being resident in the following tax year also.  </p>  <p>  Under split year treatment, an individual is entitled to full personal tax credits and allowances for the year of arrival, notwithstanding the fact that employment income earned in the year of arrival, prior to the date of arrival, is not subject to Irish tax.  Such individuals are chargeable to tax on the full amount of any non-employment income, such as investment income, for the year of arrival.  </p>  <p>  A separate relief which may be available to returning Irish emigrants who meet the necessary conditions is the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP), an income tax incentive that allows relief on a proportion of income earned by an employee who is assigned by his or her relevant employer to work in Ireland for that employer, or for an associated company of that relevant employer.  For 2015 and subsequent years, this relief is available to qualifying individuals on 30% of an employee's income over &euro;75,000.</p>  <p>  In order to avail of the SARP incentive, an employee arriving in Ireland must have worked for the relevant employer for a minimum period of 6 months prior to arrival in Ireland and must not have been resident in the State for the 5 tax years immediately preceding the tax year in which he or she arrives in the State.  A relevant employer is a company that is incorporated and tax resident in a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement or a tax information exchange agreement. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the income tax and Universal Social Charge reductions included in the last two Budgets, which have reduced the lowest three rates of USC, and the marginal rate of income tax payable by those on incomes of up to &euro;70,044 per annum.  As stated previously, I believe that these changes make Ireland a more attractive proposition, from an income tax perspective, for those Irish emigrants that may wish to return home.</p></reply>

The provisions seek to level the playing field between corporation tax, on the one hand, and personal income tax (where rates are generally higher) on the other. The close company surcharge of 20% applies in respect of investment income earned by a company, such as interest, dividend or rental income, which is not distributed to the company shareholders within 18 months of the company's year-end.  The surcharge does not apply to the retained trading income of a close company.  With investment and rental income of a company subject to tax at a 25% rate, there would be a strong incentive in the absence of a surcharge for persons to accumulate and retain such income within a company and thereby avoid marginal rate income tax and USC.  </p>  <p>  With regard to service companies (i.e. those that are engaged in professional services) that are close companies, the surcharge is extended to include a surcharge of 15% on 50% of trading profits which are not distributed within 18 months of the end of the accounting period.  The activities of service companies are those that are typically carried on by an individual or partnership. Tax legislation does not define profession so it is given its ordinary meaning, taking into account relevant case law. </p>  <p>  The service company surcharge was introduced in order to counteract an abuse whereby these activities were diverted to a company, being a company controlled by individuals who are actually providing the relevant services, and the income is withheld from distribution.  In the absence of the service company surcharge, the profits would be taxed at the corporation tax rate and, if not distributed, would avoid the higher personal income tax charge.  This would result in a loss of tax revenue and would give an unfair tax advantage to persons who structure their affairs through corporations.  As the surcharge only applies to 50% of undistributed trading income, provision is made for retention and re-investment of profits within professional services companies.</p>  <p>  Non-resident companies are not within the close company provisions. </p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from this charge in 2015 was &euro;424.13 million which is over &euro;100 million higher than the estimated yield figure used in the NERI working paper referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The Financial Institutions Levy I announced as part of Budget 2014 is a revenue raising measure which provides for a contribution from the banking sector to Ireland's economic recovery. The levy is in place for the years 2014 to 2016 inclusive with an anticipated annual yield of &euro;150 million. As the levy is a percentage of an institution's DIRT liability in 2011, liability to the levy relates to the size of an institution's Irish operation. The entire banking system has been underpinned by the strong Government support provided both here and abroad and I believe it is appropriate therefore that the banking sector should make a contribution to the State's economic recovery. Accordingly, I announced in my Budget 2016 statement that I propose to extend the levy out to 2021, subject to a review taking place of  the methodology used to calculate the levy. This will bring in an additional &euro;750 million over the period, which is a very significant additional contribution to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In relation to discussions at EU level, the Government's position is that a Financial Transactions Tax  would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres to prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions.  Notwithstanding this, the Government is not prepared to stand in the way of EU Member States that wish to work together to implement a Financial Transactions Tax and in this regard adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced cooperation took place during the Irish Presidency of the EU in January 2013.</p>  <p>  The proposal for a Directive from the European Commission in the area of financial transaction tax was published in February 2013. Ireland had many concerns about the proposal as drafted, not least of which were the potential impacts on, and the trading of, Irish Sovereign debt in the secondary market and in total, the potential negative impact on the liquidity of the financial sector as a whole. Members of the Economic and Financial Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets have stated that the introduction of the FTT would have a significantly negative effect on Sovereign Debt Markets and may impair the good-functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and therefore higher financing costs for States.</p>  <p>  Our concerns are widely shared amongst the Member States, including some of the participating countries. These concerns have led to the issuing of a communique by the participating Member States, announcing that they have agreed to implement a financial transaction tax in a progressive manner, with the first step being a charge on shares and some derivatives. More recently on 8th December 2015 the ECOFIN Council discussed the current state of play with regard to the proposal of a number of Member States to introduce a financial transaction tax. In the context of this discussion, ten of the original eleven Member States (Estonia has indicated that it no longer supports the proposal) issued a statement setting out their agreement on some principles and parameters for an FTT, as well as the areas that were still open for discussion. The statement indicates that a decision on the open issues should be made by end of June 2016.</p>  <p>  The statement of the ten Member States indicates that further work will take place regarding the applicable tax rates. The ten Members States also agreed on the need to further analyse the impact of the tax on the real economy and pension schemes. They also state that the financial viability of the tax for each country is required i.e., whether or not the costs of implementing the tax are adequately covered by its revenue.</p>  <p>  There is still uncertainty therefore as to the form the FTT might take and more detail would be needed on the final shape of the tax before a definitive conclusion could be reached about its impact on Irish taxation revenue.</p></reply>

While all 8 regions vary in size (from one county in the case of the Dublin region to 6 in the case of the North East/North West region), the geographical remit of each region is defined at NUTS III level, the standard developed and regulated by the European Union for statistical purposes.</p>  <p>  The South West Action Plan for Jobs, launched in July 2015, aims to deliver 40,000 extra jobs in the counties of Cork and Kerry by 2020.  Key targets in service of this overall goal are to achieve an increase of 40-50% in the number of start-ups in the region; a 20% increase in employment in exporting companies which will be delivered by increasing in the number of IDA investments in the region by 30-40% to 2019; and an increase of 33% in tourist numbers and 40% increase in overseas revenue from the sector.</p>  <p>  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include agri-food, tourism, manufacturing and ICT, including high-potential emerging sectors like multimedia/content and the green economy, energy and marine.</p>  <p>  Key actions in the Plan to be delivered over the coming period include measures to achieve an increase of 40-50% in the number of businesses starting-up, scaling and surviving, to achieve a 20% increase in employment in exporting companies, delivered by winning 139 IDA investments, building an IDA advance facility in Tralee and a 50% increase in enterprise-research collaborations and other measures to support growth in Irish exporting companies and establishing an Employer and Education Skills Forum.</p>  <p>  Actions are also set out to increase by 40% agri-food output to 2020 and to achieve a 33% increase in overseas tourist numbers, in addition to developing new sectors, including the content/multimedia sector, innovative energy technology and the green economy and rolling out &ldquo;smart region&rdquo; infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Since the Plan was launched, focus has moved to putting in place a comprehensive implementation structure.  A Regional Implementation Committee has been established, chaired by Mr Bob Savage, Managing Director of EMC.  The Committee is composed of key stakeholders in the region who work in concert with Enterprise Champions - nominated senior private sector representatives - to oversee and monitor progress.  The Committee held its second meeting in Tralee on 8th March last to review progress on the delivery of the Plan&rsquo;s actions.  The first Progress Report on the implementation of the Plan, covering the period to end-June 2016, will be completed and published in Q3 2016.</p>  <p>  All regional Action Plans will be supported by investment of up to &euro;250 million over the next five years, including &euro;150 million for a property investment programme by IDA Ireland.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be made available over the next five years through three competitive calls to be administered by Enterprise Ireland.  These competitive calls are being targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to support job creation across the regions.</p>  <p>  On 22nd January, a &euro;3m Regional Accelerator Scheme was launched, which aims ultimately to create more accelerator spaces in the regions where start-ups can locate their businesses and access supports.  It is targeted that a further &euro;3m will be leveraged with additional private sector investment to support this entrepreneurship initiative.  This Regional Accelerator Scheme was the first competitive initiative to be launched under the &euro;40m competitive regional jobs fund announced by the Government on 15th January.</p>  <p>  Other elements of this fund to be rolled out over the coming months include:</p>  <p>- Opportunities to drive greater company/sector collaboration/clustering in the regions</p>  <p>- Driving procurement opportunities for start-ups and established small businesses</p>  <p>- Strengthening Third-level as a driver of regional enterprise</p>  <p>- Strengthening the start-up ecosystem locally.</p></reply>

According to the Revenue Commissioners, a close company is a company that is under the control of five or fewer participators or is controlled by any number of participators who are directors.</p>  <p>  I understand that the close company surcharge applies in respect of investment income &ndash; such as interest, dividend or rental income &ndash; which is not distributed to the company shareholders within 18 months of its year-end.  Its primary purpose is to counter attempts to avail of lower company taxation rates on personal income. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland supported companies do not generally fall into the category of closed companies.  The close company surcharge is therefore not an issue that is frequently raised by the Agency&rsquo;s clients.</p>  <p>  With regard to Ireland&rsquo;s competitive rate of corporation tax of 12.5%, this has been an important part of our industrial policy since the 1950s.  It remains a cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to sustain an enterprise friendly environment that will foster further economic growth and job creation.</p>  <p>  In terms of foreign direct investment (FDI), it is important to note that tax is only one of many reasons why companies choose to locate themselves here.  Ireland has many other attributes that make it so attractive to FDI, including a highly educated workforce, the ease of doing business and the fact that we are the only English-speaking country in the Eurozone.</p></reply>

This being the case, the application did not pass the 50:50 Rule, whereby at least 50% of an employer&rsquo;s employees must be EEA nationals at time of application.  Section 10(2B) of the Employment Permits Act 2006 (as amended) provides exemptions to the 50:50 rule for certain employment permit types, including the Sport and Cultural permit.  These exemptions are as set out below:</p><p>a) at the time of application the employer has no employees </p><p>b) the foreign national in respect of whom the employment permit is being sought will be the sole employee of the employer and</p><p>c) the Minister is satisfied that the foreign national in respect of whom the employment permit is being sought will be the sole employee of the employer concerned.</p><p>The exemption at S10(2B) (a) above does not apply to the current application, since the application states that the foreign national in question is currently employed on foot of a working permission from the Minister for  Justice and Equality, known as a Stamp 2 permission.  In relation to the exemption provision set out at S10 (2B) (b), the application provided no evidence that satisfied the Minister that the foreign national concerned would remain the sole employee of the employer, thus this exemption from the 50:50 Rule could not be applied to the applicant. </p><p>The decision to refuse this application was communicated in writing to the applicant dated 15<sup>th</sup>April.

The implementing schemes under the Programme are broad ranging, and a number of schemes are concerned with promoting sustainability in the fishing sector, similar to GLAS.  These include a Sustainable Fisheries Scheme, an Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme, a Marine Biodiversity Scheme, an Engine Replacement Scheme, a Fisheries Local Area Development Scheme, a New Fishermen Scheme and an industry-led Mutual Fund for Adverse Climatic Events and Environmental Incidents.  Overall, some &euro;67 million is being made available to support fishermen through these schemes.  Further details of these Schemes are available from Board Iascaigh Mhara&rsquo;s local officers or on BIM website .</p><p>These schemes are intended to assist fishermen in adapting to the requirements and opportunities of the Common Fisheries Policy and helping fishermen secure the future sustainability of their industry for their families and their communities.</p></reply>

Article 58 of the Control Regulation which applies to fisheries and aquaculture products provides that certain catch data must be &lsquo;available&rsquo; throughout the supply chain.  Products may be combined in lots and each lot must be labelled with supply chain traceability information.  Each &lsquo;lot&rsquo; is a quantity of fishery products or aquaculture products of the same species coming from the same area and fishing vessel or fishing vessels or fish farm.  The traceability information associated with a &lsquo;lot&rsquo; is required to remain available at all stages of production.</p><p>The information to be supplied with each lot is:</p><p>-  Lot ID </p><p>-  Quantity</p><p>-  Supplier</p><p>-  Commercial name </p><p>-  Scientific name </p><p>-  Catch area </p><p>-  Production method </p><p>-  FAO alpha 3 code</p><p>-  Name of fishing vessel or vessels</p><p>-  Date of capture (landing) </p><p>-  Whether previously frozen. </p><p>Under the Common Market Organisation Regulation (EU) 1379/2013, the Area identifiable in a lot is more specific than was provided for in the Control regulation.  The CMO regulation requires the identifier of a fishing area to be expressed at the level of FAO sub-area, division, sub-division, fishing effort zone etc., in terms understandable to the consumer.</p><p>The Competent Authority in Ireland for the implementation of Article 58 of the Control regulation on traceability is the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  The Authority in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara is carrying out a project called e-LOCATE.</p><p>e-LOCATE is designed to promote the efficient and secure collection, management  and sharing of product information, through the adoption of global standards and best practices for weighing, labelling and data exchange.</p><p>BIM and the SFPA launched the EU funded e-LOCATE scheme in 2013 to provide ﬁnancial assistance to Irish seafood enterprises for the implementation of new hardware and software for weighing, labelling and traceability.  Key to the project was enabling the industry&rsquo;s transition away from paper-based documentation to adopting modern automatic identiﬁcation and data capture (AIDC) technologies such as bar code scanning, that could facilitate the storing and sharing of information in a standardised, electronic way.</p></reply>

Where entitlements are the subject of inheritance they must be inherited by the rightful beneficiary in the first instance prior to transferring them by lease.  Entitlements may not be leased out by the Reps of a deceased farmer.  In the event that a Grant of Representation is not available at the time of application to inherit the entitlements, an Indemnity on the Transfer of Entitlements will be accepted in lieu.  The Indemnity Form is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Basic Payment Scheme entitlements may be used by the Reps of a deceased farmer in 2016 by submitting a Basic Payment scheme application form on behalf of the estate.</p>  <p>  A person inheriting Basic Payment Scheme entitlements, who does not intend to farm, may apply for a BPS Transfer Number by contacting the Inheritance Enquiry Unit of my Department at lo-call 0761 064428.  This number can be used for the purpose of inheriting the entitlements and either leasing or selling them to an active farmer who will be in a position to use the entitlements.</p>  <p>  The Single Payment Scheme was introduced to Ireland in 2005 and operated until 31 December 2014.  Payment entitlements allocated under that scheme were not attached to land and formed a separate proprietary asset in the estate of a deceased farmer. As such, where payment entitlements were not specifically mentioned in the will, they formed part of the residue of the estate. In 2015 the Basic Payment Scheme was introduced to Ireland and Regulation 1307/2013 provided for the allocation of payment entitlements.  The relevant Division within my Department is currently in consultation with my Department&rsquo;s Legal Services Division in relation to situations where a will is silent on payment entitlements.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Inheritance Enquiry Unit provides advice and expertise on all issues relating to inheritance and administration of estates as relevant to all Department schemes and services and may be contacted at 0761 064 428.</p></reply>

Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring

vehicles is monitored and reviewed on a continual basis and vehicles are allocated between districts as required by operational circumstances including, for example, when vehicles are required in other districts to substitute for vehicles under repair.</p><p>In that context I am advised by the Garda Authorities that the information requested by the Deputy is set out as follows: </p><p>Vehicles

My officials and I are currently examining those recommendations</p><p>The current prisoner complaints system was introduced in the Irish Prison Service in November 2012 based on a model recommended by the Inspector of Prisons who has independent oversight of the process.  The intention was to have robust procedures in place which would give prisoners access to a credible complaints system that deals with genuine complaints in an open, transparent and independent way.</p><p>The system is categorised depending on the nature of the complaint.  Category A complaints concern the most serious level of complaint (assault, serious intimidation by staff etc.).  Category B complaints include allegations of discrimination, verbal abuse by officers and inappropriate searches.  Category C complaints are essentially service complaints where a prisoner is unhappy with the level of service in a particular prison.  Category D complaints are those alleging misconduct or mistreatment by professionals providing services to prisoners such as doctors, dentists etc.</p><p>In January 2013 the then Minister announced amendments to the Prison Rules to support and give effect to the new procedures for the investigation of prisoner complaints.  In the main, the amendments to the Prison Rules provide that prisoner complaints under Category A will be examined by investigators from outside the Prison Service to ensure an effective and impartial investigation.  The complainant was to be kept informed and the reports by outside investigators are automatically submitted to the Governor in question, the Director General and the Inspector of Prisons.  The Inspector has had oversight of the process from the very beginning which was also strengthened by extra resources assigned to his office.  A panel of 22 external investigators were recruited and since the introduction of the complaints procedure in November 2012 to date there have been 348 Category A complaints received under the new system.</p><p>In addition, there are fourteen Prison Visiting Committees in existence - one for each institution.  The function of Visiting Committees is to visit the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner.  The Committees play a vital role in ensuring the quality of accommodation and catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities.</p><p>Below are tables showing details of Category A complaints made in the period from November, 2012 - when the new comprehensive prisoner complaints system was introduced - to date.  Tables 3 and 4 show for the period November 2012 to 2015 the type of complaints made, the outcomes of the complaints procedures and the number of complaints by prison.  Tables 1 and 2 provide this data for 2016 to date.  Overall, for the period November 2012 to date, 384 Category A complaints have been received.  Of these, 18 were upheld,  249 were not upheld, 1 was not proved, 23 were terminated under section 57B(5)(C) of the Prison Rules, 2007 and 57 are currently incomplete. </p><p>Rule 57B (5)(c) of the Prison Rules 2007 provides that &quot;If the complaint is withdrawn, the Governor, or the Designated Officer where the Governor is the subject of the complaint, shall inquire as to why the complaint was withdrawn, document the reasons given and forward a report to the Director General.  If there is any evidence of any threat or inducement for the complainant to withdraw the complaint, the initiation of disciplinary proceedings shall be considered.  On receipt of the Governor's or the Designated Officer's report, the Director General may decide that the investigation should be terminated (and if so document the reasons for doing so and advise the Inspector of Prisons) or direct that the investigative process should continue.&quot;</p><p><b>Table 1: Category A Complaints received by prison 2016</b><table><tr><th>Prison</th><th>Category A Complaints by Prison</th></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dochas</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>St. Patricks</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>30</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Outcome of Category A Complaints received 2016</b><table><tr><th>Category A Complaint by Outcome</th><th></th><th>Category A Complaint by Type</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Upheld</td><td>0</td><td>Assault</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Not Upheld</td><td>2</td><td>Mistreatment etc</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Not Proved</td><td>0</td><td>Racial</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Terminated 57B(5)(c)</td><td>1</td><td>Sexual</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Incomplete</td><td>27</td><td>Threats/<br /><br />Intimidation</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>30</td><td>Total</td><td>30</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3: Category A Complaints received by prison 2012-2015</b><table><tr><th>Prison</th><th>Category A Complaints by Prison</th></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Dochas</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>St. Patricks</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>318</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 4: Outcome of Category A Complaints received 2012-2015</b><table><tr><th>Category A Complaint by Outcome</th><th></th><th>Category A Complaint by Type</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Upheld</td><td>18</td><td>Assault</td><td>164</td></tr><tr><td>Not Upheld</td><td>247</td><td>Mistreatment etc</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Not Proved</td><td>1</td><td>Racial</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Terminated 57B(5)(c)</td><td>22</td><td>Sexual</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Incomplete</td><td>30</td><td>Threats/<br /><br />Intimidation</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>318</td><td>Total</td><td>318</td></tr></table></p></reply>

For instance, if there is a delay in receiving the Garda report or if Tribunal queries arise which result in applicants taking time to respond or if there is a dispute between dependants or family members an application may take some time to finalise.  In addition, I understand that in cases of serious injury to the victim it can take a considerable amount of time (in some cases a number of years) before their treating consultant is in a position to give a final prognosis.</p>  <p>  There is no time limit for the submission of an application in a fatal case.  However, under the terms of the Scheme it is a matter for the claimant to establish his/her case, that is, to provide the Tribunal with the necessary documentation to support the claim.</p>  <p>  Applications are processed as quickly as possible subject to some of the constraints mentioned above.</p></reply>

This is usually in the form of a currently valid passport and may include other original supporting documents, such as a birth certificate and marriage certificate.  In rare circumstances where an applicant cannot produce their passport or other supporting documents the applicant will be required to provide a full explanation.  Such explanation should be supported by satisfactory evidence that they have attempted to obtain such documentation and correspondence from the relevant authorities responsible for the issuing of passports in their country, clearly stating the reasons the documentation cannot be provided.  INIS will consider the reasons given and, if satisfied it is for reasons genuinely beyond the applicant's control, may suggest alternative means to the person to assist in establishing their identity and nationality.</p>  <p>  In this particular case, correspondence issued to the person concerned on 27 January 2016 and reminders on 2 February 2016 and 29 February 2016, requesting her national passport or satisfactory explanation from the relevant authorities stating a reason why a passport is unobtainable. Upon receipt of the requested information, or in the event that the person does not respond, the case will be further processed and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and I know the Deputy will appreciate that it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Section 8 of the Act provides that there shall be a Coroner for every Coroner's district who shall be appointed by the Local Authority in whose area the district is situated.

However, Section 32 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2011 provides for the amalgamation of Coronial districts within a Local Authority area by the Minister for Justice and Equality in consultation with the Local Authority concerned.

This list has been derived from two sources: advice from the Higher Capitation Advisory Board in 2011, and ongoing reviews of qualifications submitted to the DCYA.  Applications for recognition are reviewed by a board with expertise in qualifications, early childhood care and education and early years policy, in association with the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>In preparing the list of DCYA Early Years Recognised Qualifications, all decisions on the acceptability of these qualifications have been reviewed against a set of criteria including core knowledge and skills identified as essential for practice in Early Years settings, being:</p><p>- Child Development 0-6;</p><p>- Early Childhood Education - Theory and Practice;</p><p>- Child Health and Welfare 0-6 years.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills is carrying out a comprehensive review of the education and training qualifications in early childhood education and care during 2016 and 2017 in consultation with the DCYA, education partners and the wider sector.  The findings of the review may inform future decisions in relation to determining whether qualifications are suitable for professional practice in the ECCE sector and the Department reserves the right to review the recognition of any qualification on the published list.</p><p>Where a qualification is not published on the list of National Framework of Qualifications on the DCYA website, but the holder considers it to be an appropriate major award or the equivalent, they should apply to this Department through the Qualification Recognition process.

The NOSP, in partnership with the voluntary sector, helps to support a wide array of work in communities across the county that focus on promoting positive mental health and reducing suicide and self-harm by providing significant grant funding each year as well as by assisting in coordinating and giving a strategic direction to the work undertaken.

It is within the professional/patient relationship that the options for treatment are most appropriately discussed and advice as to where services might be sought is given, including availing of this Directive for overseas treatment within the EU/EEA. In order to inform health professionals about the Directive, the HSE has met and communicated with a number of professional bodies and organisations, such the ICGP, the Independent Hospital Association, and various voluntary hospitals and hospital groups, to inform them how their patients can access healthcare under the terms of the Directive. </p>  <p>  The HSE also wrote to the Hospital Groups CEOs and each Hospital Chief Officer in January 2016 reminding them of the Directive and its operation.  In the letter the HSE provided sample text informing patients of their rights under the Directive.  The letter suggested that, as they deem appropriate, the CEOs/Chief Officers might include this information in any relevant communication to patients, e.g., waiting list letters.  The HSE continues to be available to meet Groups regarding the Directive.</p>  <p>  Under the Directive insured patients are entitled to have costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation. The HSE endeavours to reimburse the cost of treatment incurred or the cost of providing such healthcare in the State, whichever is the lesser, to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of a claim for reimbursement, in line with Prompt Payment legislation.</p>  <p>  Each Member State is free to set its own payment policy for cross-border healthcare services; by means of reimbursement to the patient or by direct payment to the healthcare provider. That policy decision is a matter for each Member State under the Directive and, similar to the majority of Member States, Ireland has no plan to introduce a policy of direct payment to each healthcare service provider, both public and private, in all EU/EEA Member States for healthcare services provided by them.</p></reply>

This policy has been supported by the provision of &euro;160 million since 2012. Over this period, in the region of 1,550 new Mental Health posts have been approved.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the Government launched &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo;, our new strategy to reduce suicide for the period 2015 &ndash; 2020.  The Strategy sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and wellbeing.  This includes a greater focus on the important area of support for families and communities in suicide prevention, and will include providing community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention.</p>  <p>  Dealing with the current levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm is a national priority.  Funding for suicide prevention, provided to the National Office for Suicide Prevention by the HSE, has increased from &euro;3.7 million in 2010 to &euro;8.8 million in 2015, an increase of almost 140% in just five years.  In addition, &euro;1.2 million has been made available annually since 2014 to fund HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and other regional suicide prevention initiatives.</p></reply>

The websites are updated regularly taking into account the latest information available.</p>  <p>  Malaria is prevalent in a number of countries. Before travelling people are advised to get up-to-date medical advice as to whether they will need anti-malarial medication, avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, use appropriate bed nets and repellents, and wear closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.</p>  <p>  As well as effective treatments for patients who contract malaria, there are effective prophylactic medications that can be taken to prevent the development of malaria. The type of prophylaxis depends on the area, local species of malaria, local pattern of anti-malarial drug resistance (which is increasing) and personal characteristics such as allergies and contraindications, including (for some drugs) pregnancy. Doctors can recommend which is the most suitable. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, no anti-malarial prophylaxis medication gives complete protection. Malaria may be contracted despite taking anti-malarial prophylaxis. If it is taken exactly as prescribed by your doctor, without missing doses, there is a high likelihood of avoiding malaria. The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and people are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their medication.</p></reply>

In 2008, the KPMG, <i>Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area </i>report, noted that Dublin&rsquo;s model of stand-alone maternity hospitals did not align with the considered norm internationally, and acknowledged that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services.  The report recommended,<i>inter </i>alia, that the NMH should be relocated to the SVUH campus. In 2013, my predecessor, with the agreement of both hospitals, formally announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to relocate the NMH to Elm Park, and that funding had been approved in the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plan to allow the project to proceed.</p><p>I am aware of the current difficulties in relation to the project and my Department has attempted to mediate a resolution. However, I am not in a position to give the Deputy the undertaking she requests. As both hospitals are voluntary independent hospitals, a solution cannot be imposed upon them. Ultimately, both hospitals will have to reach an agreement in relation to the outstanding governance issues if the project, as envisaged, is to proceed.</p></reply>

These include:</p><p>a) <b><i>Measures to reduce the numbers of patients attending hospital</i></b></p><p>A number of measures have been introduced to reduce the numbers of patients attending hospital, by improving access to primary and community care services.  </p><p>b) <b><i>Measures to expand hospital capacity</i></b></p><p>The second category of measures to alleviate ED overcrowding has focussed on expanding hospital capacity.  In June 2015, &euro;18m additional funding was made available to the HSE under the Winter Additional Capacity Initiative to increase hospital bed capacity.  This initiative has facilitated the opening of 246 new hospital beds and the reopening of 116 previously closed beds, giving a total of 364 additional beds in our hospital system.  Measures are also being implemented to expand hospital capacity, through the recruitment of additional hospital staff.  </p><p>c) <b><i>Measures to support timely patient discharge from hospital</i></b></p><p>Measures to facilitate timely discharge of patients from hospitals are also in place.  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme has been a key measure in reducing delayed discharges.  To further achieve improvements in the number of delayed discharges from hospitals, the HSE is in the process of establishing a Bed Bureau for the greater Dublin area.</p><p>d) <b><i>Measures to enhance hospitals&rsquo; responsiveness to increased demand for emergency care</i></b></p><p>The final category of measures to alleviate ED overcrowding are those which seek to improve hospital processes and responsiveness to increased demand for emergency care.  In November 2015, with the HSE Director General, a National Emergency Department Escalation Framework was issued to provide direction to hospitals on how best to manage capacity and patient flow at times when there is a surge in demand for emergency care.  </p><p>In respect of specific overcrowding issues in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, as this is a service matter I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The EU and Turkey have engaged deeply on developing joint approaches and the EU&rsquo;s engagement with Turkey was the focus of the most recent European Council on 17 and 18 March 2016.</p><p>The core intention of the EU-Turkey agreement which emerged from the Council is to break the business model of the people smugglers who are profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable.  Critically, it should stop people getting into unsafe boats and risking their lives.</p><p>The need to comply with international law was at the heart of the March European Council discussions.  The legal advice of the EU institutions was that there is such compliance. </p><p>All migrants will be protected in accordance with the relevant international standards and in respect of the principle of <i>non-refoulement.</i>The EU and Turkey have agreed that there will be no blanket returns and no automatic returns of asylum seekers.  In addition, the &euro;3 billion Facility for refugees in Turkey is aimed at supporting Syrians and other refugees by providing access to food, shelter, education, and healthcare.  This funding has been accelerated and, as of 19 April, &euro;187 million has been committed to the Facility. </p><p>Steps to address the migration challenge are also continuing outside of the EU-Turkey framework.  In addition to the humanitarian aid provided by Ireland, we agreed last year to accept up to 4,000 migrants, despite our opt-out from EU legislation in the area of freedom, security and justice.  Last year the Irish Naval service rescued 8,592 migrants from the Mediterranean Sea. </p></reply>

Under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order of 1973 the carriage of munitions of war is prohibited on civil aircraft through Irish airspace or airports unless an exemption has been obtained in advance from the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport. Questions concerning the operation of the application process are a matter for that Department.</p>  <p>  When the operator of a civil aircraft makes an application to the Minister for such an exemption the Minister seeks the advice of relevant Government Departments and agencies. My Department is consulted in relation to any foreign policy issues that may arise and may provide observations to the Department of Tourism, Transport and Sport which takes the final decision on all applications.</p>  <p>  In considering applications circulated by the Department of Tourism, Transport and Sport, my Department examines the nature of the munitions that it is proposed to carry. My Department will recommend against granting an exemption where the munitions in question are non-discriminatory in their effects. This policy stems from Ireland&rsquo;s clear objection to &ldquo;indiscriminate weapons&rdquo; and is consistent with international humanitarian law (IHL) which regulates the conduct of armed conflict. A basic rule of IHL is that, in military operations, parties to an armed conflict must distinguish between combatants and civilians, and the use of a weapon which is inherently indiscriminate is prohibited. </p>  <p>  Thus, as a matter of policy, my Department would recommend against granting an exemption for the carriage of items such as cluster munitions, anti-personnel landmines, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. Additionally, my Department will generally recommend against granting an exemption for the carriage of grenades, bombs, missiles or rockets. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been a strong advocate for the Arms Trade Treaty and was one of the first countries to sign and ratify the Treaty which entered into force on 24 December 2014.  As a State Party Ireland will continue to advocate for implementation of the Treaty to reduce the risk of diversion, improve transparency and protect civilians by reducing the risks of weapons contributing to breaches in international humanitarian and human rights law, including the risk of weapons contributing to gender based violence. </p></reply>

Placing human rights at the heart of the peace process in Northern Ireland has helped to ensure the participation and trust of all communities. As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles. </p>  <p>  During the course of the Stormont House talks in late 2014, the Government advanced the view that a Bill of Rights could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based. Sufficient consensus amongst the Northern Ireland Executive Parties did not exist to take this forward within the context of the Stormont House Agreement. However, the final Agreement provided that the Parties commit to serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the obligations on government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and its successor Agreements must be implemented in full.  The Agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island. The Government will continue to work closely with the UK Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

On 15 March 2016 the US Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced significant amendments to the United States&rsquo; Cuban Assets Control Regulations, which took effect on March 16 2016. These amendments expand Cuban access to foreign financial institutions and allow for increased access to the Cuban banking system for institutions which had previously been at risk of sanctions imposed by the US government. These changes have come about as part of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 2015 after a hiatus of 53 years. If the Deputy is aware of ongoing difficulties involving Irish banks, my Department will be happy to provide any assistance as may be helpful. I am not in a position to comment on the actions of UK banks.</p>  <p>  The historic events of the past 18 months have seen immense progress in US-Cuba relations, enhanced by the visit of President Obama to Havana in March 2016. In addition to the full restoration of diplomatic relations, recent months have seen the two sides achieve significant agreements with regard to communications and travel between the US and Cuba.</p>  <p>  Our concerns about economic, commercial and financial measures against Cuba are long-standing and clear. We no do not support unilaterally imposed measures that impede the economic and commercial relations of EU member states with Cuba.</p>  <p>  On 27th October 2015, Ireland joined with all other member states of the European Union in voting in favour of Cuba&rsquo;s resolution at the UN General Assembly in New York, which called for the ending of the US embargo on Cuba. Ireland, along with its EU partners, is firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo, which would require approval by the US Congress, would facilitate an opening of the Cuban economy to the benefit of the Cuban people.</p></reply>

My Department has since had two further meetings with the ILCU to address technical aspects of its proposal. The most recent meeting was on 13 April 2016.   </p>  <p>  The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016. Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications including to Regulation 25(2) which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature. The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the recent modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing.</p>  <p>  Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Finance met with the Central Bank on 21 April 2016 to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements. This was with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the funding mechanisms will have to be put in place in the first instance by the ILCU w ith the support of its members, and with the agreement of the Central Bank. I and my Department are happy to continue to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support.   </p></reply>

Up to 2014, general purpose grants (GPG) were a contribution, from my Department, towards meeting the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers. The general purpose grant allocations to local authorities in 2014 were in respect of the local authority area as a whole and took into account any former borough or town councils within the area.  The 2014 GPG allocations recognised the move of water related costs from local authorities to Irish Water in 2014.  2015 saw the introduction of Local Property Tax (LPT) allocations being paid to local authorities through the Local Government Fund.  </p>  <p>   Given that local authorities vary significantly in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, the Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than they received from their GPG allocation in 2014. Accordingly, the LPT allocations for 2015 and 2016 take account of the historical GPG funding provided to any former borough or town councils within the local authority area.</p></reply>
