We also discussed Brexit, including the unique circumstances regarding the border, and preparations for the upcoming meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 19 and 20 October. </p><p>In our call on 16 October we also spoke about the damage from storm Ophelia and the Bombardier case.</p><p>Prime Minister May and I spoke by phone again on November 1 to review progress made by the political parties in Northern Ireland since our previous phone conversation, including in light of the statement to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire the previous day.</p><p>We agreed that it is still possible to form an Executive which would be in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.  I underlined that there could be no return to direct rule as it existed prior to the Good Friday Agreement and that the various provisions of the Agreement would have to be honoured.</p><p>The Prime Minister was clear that she did not want to see a return to a direct rule and that moves to implement a Budget for Northern Ireland should not be seen as a first step on the road to direct rule.</p><p>We agreed that there is still time to reach an agreement and that the parties should continue to work to this end, with the support of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney and the Northern Secretary James Brokenshire.  </p><p>The Prime Minister and I agreed to stay in close contact on the matter over the coming period.</p></reply>

It is clear that the weather conditions over the past number of weeks have been challenging and this has created difficulties for farmers in parts of the country, particularly in the Western Regions and on heavier lands. </p>  <p>  Grass growth rates through September and October were ahead of recent years. Data from Pasturebase Ireland indicates that production is running about 1 tonne dry matter per hectare ahead of last year.  Notwithstanding this, grazing conditions did deteriorate from mid August on farms with heavier land.  This has given farmers a number of challenging weeks managing livestock with animals having to be temporarily housed and difficulties with securing later cut silage.  I note that there appears to be reasonable supplies of feed and fodder available across the country for those farmers who may require to supplement their own fodder supply.  Given these challenges, I have asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties, supporting the need for good budgeting of fodder supplies on farms for the winter ahead.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission agreed to my request for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme, this has been prompted by the protracted inclement weather conditions and also market difficulties caused by currency fluctuations.  This means an increase from 50% to 70% in the advance payment rate for the BPS to those applicants whose applications were confirmed fully clear. These payments were recently issued, and balancing payments will be made with effect from early December.  There will also be an increase permitted to the advance for Pillar II Rural Development schemes such as GLAS.   </p>  <p>  These payments and the payments under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, are injecting up to &euro;800 million into the Irish rural economy and will provide a very welcome boost for Irish farm families. </p>  <p>  Taking account of this, there are no plans at this time to establish a fodder aid scheme.  My Department will continue to closely monitor the situation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-08a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017110800078#WRB01000"><p>I want to make it clear that the Government has not sought reduction in the amounts allocated for the Basic Payment Scheme, and that as a matter of National policy,  our objective has been to maintain the overall budget for CAP, including the Basic Payment scheme. </p>  <p>  In relation to the amount for individual payments, however, since the 16th October 2015, Ireland decided to confine the maximum amount payable to any one applicant under the Basic Payment Scheme (excluding the Greening Payment) to &euro;150,000 per annum.  </p>  <p>  Regulation 1307/2013, required payments over &euro;150,000 to be reduced (degressivity) and in this context Ireland applied a 100% cut to any payment over that amount. Ireland had actively supported the concept of a maximum level during the current CAP negotiations back in 2013.  </p>  <p>  While the 2016 Programme for Government, proposed a lowering of the cap on basic payments from &euro;150,000 to &euro;100,000 during a mid term review of the CAP, this opportunity is unlikely to arise as there will be no mid term review of the existing CAP and a lowering of the limit would require a legislative change of the Basic Act 1307/2013 (Direct Payments Regulation) in Council, something that has not been envisaged as part of the Commission ongoing simplification and modernisation programme of the existing CAP.  I am however committed to addressing this matter in the context of the future reform of the CAP, with the Commission scheduled to publish a communication on CAP post 2020, on 29 November 2017. </p>  <p>In that context, my Department received a leaked document on 19 October 2017 titled the &ldquo;The Future of Food and Farming&rdquo; and it is assumed this is an early draft of the Commission communication scheduled for 29 November 2017.  While the extent to which its content will be reflected in the final communication is of course unclear, a notable element included is the suggestion to cap direct payments at between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000.  My officials are currently examining the impact of such a proposal.</p></reply>

My Department actively participates in the EU Agriculture, Forests and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) team to promote and seek EU agreement on the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use approach to the treatment of the land sector in UN climate change negotiations.</p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce GHG emissions is clearly understood by Government as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  Officials from my Department are involved in a number of cross-departmental committees and technical analysis groups established to progress the national climate action agenda.</p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies have been strongly focussed on improving the efficiency of Irish farming which is key to reducing emissions.  We are focussed on improving animal, grassland and nutrient management and have invested heavily in a number of schemes and measures such as the Origin Green initiative, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme and our Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS.  Our knowledge transfer programmes are key to bringing the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers. These strategies have led to a significant disaggregation of production output and emissions, with current analysis suggesting that the emissions intensity per kcal of food output in 2013 is reduced approximately 14% relative to 2005. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are part of Irelands National delegation led by DCCAE and have also been engaging with the UNFCCC&rsquo;s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA) which is tasked with considering issues related to agriculture. We have engaged in a number of workshops which has seen a lot of good work happening at the technical level. </p>  <p>  Development and promotion of locally appropriate technologies and practices based on sound science is crucial to ensure that food production is both resilient to climate change and makes best use of limited resources.</p></reply>

There are currently no plans to establish a special task force on native woodlands.</p>  <p>  The Native Woodland Establishment Scheme is a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s Forestry Programme, particularly in realising broadleaf targets and in demonstrating how appropriately-sited and managed forest cover, in the form of native woodlands, can bring a wide range of benefits.  My Department is currently carrying out a midterm review of the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 in which a number of new initiatives are being considered to boost the planting of native trees.  This may include possible improvements to the Native Woodland Conservation scheme. This scheme aims to enhance and protect existing native woodlands. </p>  <p>  Furthermore within the context of the Water Framework Directive my Department is promoting its &lsquo;Woodland for Water&rsquo; concept involving the development of new native woodlands specifically created to protect and enhance water quality.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of these woodlands have been neglected or exploited in the last century or two, and have lapsed as functioning coppice woodland to form high forest canopy. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Native Woodland Conservation Scheme supports the protection and enhancement of existing native woodlands.  The restoration of these former coppice or coppice-with-standards woodland to active coppice management is an eligible operation under this scheme. To date, every valid application under this scheme has been approved. </p>  <p>  My Department also supports the growing of timber for wood fuel under the Forestry for Fibre grant and premium category.  Forestry for Fibre provides financial assistance to landowners who want to plant trees for use as domestic fuel or as an energy source generating heat and/or electricity.  Trees planted under Forestry for Fibre can be harvested in 10 &ndash; 15 years, generating yields of between 150 &ndash; 300 cubic metres per hectare.  This rotation is significantly less than conventional forestry where conifer forests mature between 35 and 40 years.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to support the planting of new native forests under the afforestation scheme. Under this scheme the entire cost of establishment is covered by the grants available.  Furthermore, the highest level of premiums are paid for native woodland establishment  where annual premiums of &euro;635 per hectare is available to landowners for 15 years.  Further improvements to this grant and premium category have been proposed under the midterm review in order to further encourage landowners to plant native woodlands. </p></reply>

We continue to monitor the situation closely and respond as appropriate to developments in order to defend the interests of Irish farmers, working in close co-operation with my Government colleagues, particularly the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  At political level, I have continuously raised the issue with my Member State colleagues and with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstr&ouml;m, both within the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in written form.  These efforts have been reinforced at official level through similar contacts with Member States and the Commission, particularly through the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Trade Policy Committee.  The Taoiseach has also raised the matter with Presidents Junker and Macron.</p>  <p>  Most recently Ireland made the latest in a series of very strong interventions on this matter at the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels on 27 October, and I raised the matter at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg in October and again in Brussels this week.  I have also worked very closely with a number of other Member States, most notably France, including in the production of a joint paper that was submitted to the European Commission on 26 September outlining our shared concerns.  And I wrote to Commissioner Malmstroem in early October reiterating my concerns in relation to the tabling of a beef tariff rate quota offer by the EU during the most recent round of negotiations.</p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector.  In this regard I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agrifood sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market. </p>  <p>  Against this background I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to engage closely with other Member States and the Commission to ensure that the interests of the EU beef sector are protected in any trade deal with Mercosur countries. </p></reply>

In contrast, emissions decreased slightly in Western Europe. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, methane accounts for approximately 22% of our national GHG emissions and is based on nationally appropriate emissions factors and robust national animal census figures.  </p>  <p>  As the deputy will be aware, there is a whole of Government approach to climate policy as set out in the National Climate Policy Position.  Officials from my Department work very closely with other Departments and in particular, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, which is the lead department in this area. </p>  <p>  The long-term ambition for the Irish agriculture and land use sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 provides a statutory basis for Government policy on climate change. As required by the Act, a National Mitigation Plan (NMP) was published in July and includes key sectoral mitigation measures for the agriculture, forest and land use sector.</p>  <p>  Irish agricultural production is recognised by international independent analysis as having one of the lowest carbon-footprints within the EU.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre Report of 2010 also recognised with regards to dairy systems in Europe, intensive systems create less methane and nitrous oxide emissions than extensive ones, but this is countered by higher emissions from land use and land use change. Lowest emissions are created by extensive grassland systems, such as those in Ireland. The FAO has also recognised the efficiency of our temperate grassland based production system.</p>  <p>  A range of actions are being undertaken to make Irish farming even more environmentally sustainable, including measures under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), which is worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years. The Programme is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including knowledge transfer programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to invest in and engage with research initiatives to further assist with the refinement, development and deployment of new and innovative practices to reduce GHGs that are associated with agricultural production. Future policy interventions will be based on the outcome of such well-informed scientific research.</p></reply>

As a response to Ireland's concerns, the special position of Ireland is explicitly recognised in the Article 50 negotiating guidelines, which indicate that flexible and imaginative solutions will be required to avoid a hard border. </p>  <p>  This is also the position articulated in Prime Minister May's letter triggering Article 50 on 29th March 2017, and equally is reflected in the position adopted by the European Parliament.  The need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area is a critical part of this dynamic.  All of the institutions of the European Union and the UK Government are ad idem on these principles, and I believe that there is a broad political consensus in this House also.  Clearly the best protection for farmers in Co. Wexford and elsewhere, lies in the avoidance of a hard border.</p>  <p>  Ever since the UK Referendum on Brexit, I and my Department have been actively engaged in assessing the impact of the vote on the Irish agrifood sector, consulting with appropriate stakeholders and engaging with the relevant politicians and institutions.  This work is being done in conjunction with the overall Government response led by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>  <p>  While the main impact to date of the Brexit vote has been the effect of sterling volatility on those businesses that have a significant trading relationship with the UK, the medium to long term threats include the possible introduction of tariffs on trade between the EU and UK, potential divergences in regulations and standards between the EU and UK, and the implications of border controls and certification requirements. </p>  <p>  I and my Department, in cooperation with Government and other Departments and Agencies, are attempting to mitigate the consequences through a range of activities under two distinctive pillars &ndash; Competitiveness and Product/Market Diversification.</p>  <p>  Under Competitiveness my Department introduced a number of measures in Budget 2017 to help minimise farm gate and business costs, including the introduction of &euro;150m low cost loan scheme for primary producers, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes.  Under Budget 2018, I have provided exchequer funding to support a &euro;300m Brexit loan scheme, at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses, and my Department is working with SBCI to develop a similar scheme for farmers, Fishermen and food business.   </p>  <p>  Under Product/Market Diversification I continue to support Bord Bia in its investment in market prioritisation initiatives, which are aimed at identifying potential diversification opportunities.  Since the final quarter of 2016 I have provided Bord Bia with more than &euro;14 million in additional funding for a programme of marketing and promotional activity in international and EU markets , and also in the UK.  </p>  <p>  I have also allocated an additional &euro;2m to  Teagasc to allow them to commence work on an &euro;8.8m investment in a new National Food Innovation Hub which will help Irish food businesses to innovate and expand.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that I and the Government remain very focused on supporting the agrifood industry through the challenges ahead. I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and or burdensome customs and administrative procedures.  </p></reply>

We are, however, fortunate in that we have an excellent industry-led strategy for the growth of the sector in Food Wise 2025 which provides a clear road-map for its development. </p><p>Last April I set out a seven point plan which was aimed at increasing international market access for Irish food and drink exports. The plan is being implemented by my Department, with significant input from Bord Bia and Irish Embassies around the world, in order to help increase the footprint of our food and drink exports.</p><p>Ireland has been proactive in addressing market access issues, so that markets are open when demand factors align in our favour. For example, in 2017 Ireland hosted inspection visits from Chinese, US and  South Korean authorities.  There  have also been a number of notable market access successes in recent years: </p><p>- Ireland was the first EU country to gain access to the US market for beef in 2014;</p><p>- Ireland has agreed a beef protocol with China and is working through the final stages of access with Chinese authorities;</p><p>- For meat sectors in 2017 alone, access has been granted or trade conditions simplified in Egypt, Namibia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Singapore, Israel, and Chile. </p><p>The Department is continuing to work with competent authorities in many other third countries  on beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat, seafood and poultry access issues. </p><p>Later this week I will lead a Trade Mission to South East Asia, this time to Japan and the Republic of Korea where I hope to deepen trade ties and develop new market opportunities. This follows on from earlier trade missions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Feb/March, and to the USA and Mexico last June.  In addition, over the past two years I have  led trade missions to China, Singapore, the Gulf States and Morocco,  Minister of State Doyle has led missions to Vietnam and South Korea, and departmental officials have led missions to Iran, Algeria and Turkey. </p><p>The UK will continue to be a vital market outlet for our industry, and with that in mind,  I have met with the CEOs of the major UK retailers to impress upon them Ireland's continued commitment to meeting the requirements of UK retailers and consumers. </p><p>I am keenly aware of the need to ensure that adequate market opportunities continue to exist for our agrifood products after the UK exit the EU and I wish to assure the House that I, my Department and our Agencies will continue to do everything necessary to ensure that this is so.</p></reply>

I am confident that as our economy continues to grow the nursery sector will likewise prosper.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s horticulture sector contributed over &euro;430m to the value of output at farm-gate level. The horticulture sector is estimated to be directly responsible for over 6,600 jobs with many more employed indirectly both upstream and downstream.  Within the total horticulture farm gate output value of &euro;430m the hardy nursery stock sector and the protected amenity plant sector combined to contribute almost &euro;51m in 2016 to the value of output at farm-gate level.  This value was up from an estimated &euro;44m in 2015.</p>  <p>  While market prospects for amenity plant growers are certainly very positive, I am very conscious of the challenges, not least from the recent storms, currently facing the industry and my Department, along with the various state agencies; Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, are working closely to support the industry through a number of measures. </p>  <p>  The Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector is the main support offered by my Department to the amenity or nursery sector.  This scheme facilitates capital investments in a broad range of specialised horticultural equipment and buildings by providing grant aid on approved costs at a rate of 40%. In the case of young applicants under 35 years of age the rate of grant aid increases to 50%. </p>  <p>  This scheme is highly regarded by the industry and is an excellent vehicle for investment in all sectors of the Horticulture industry.  I sought an increase in the Budget allocation for the scheme in 2017 and this increase has been maintained through the allocation of &euro;5m for the Scheme in 2018.  In light of the sectoral demand, I am working to advance the launch of the 2018 Commercial Horticulture Scheme . A timely launch of the 2018 Scheme is recognition of the most recent challenge to the sector but is also a clear signal of my continued support for, and commitment to its ongoing development. </p>  <p>  Under the scheme, &euro;6.4 million in grant aid has been paid to applicants from the Nursery Stock and related Amenity Plant Sectors over the period 2008-2016.  This has supported investment of almost &euro;16 million by the sector.  In the current year a further &euro;1.1 million in grant aid has been allocated under the scheme to 29 applicants from the Nursery Stock and related Amenity Plant Sectors. </p>  <p>  This year, approvals under the scheme were issued to an overall total of 156 applicants across the horticulture industry.  Many of the 2017 scheme applicants have already been inspected and paid.  The processing of more recent claims is on-going and every effort is being made to deliver payments as quickly as possible to assist growers that may be facing cash flow issues.  For 2017 the Commercial Horticulture Grants Scheme was allocated a budget of &euro;5m and my staff advise me that they expect the full budget available for the scheme this year will be utilised. </p>  <p>  Maintaining the increased allocation of &euro;5m in funding for the 2018 Scheme of Investment Aid for Commercial Horticulture reflects this Government's commitment to ongoing support for Ireland&rsquo;s horticulture sector.  The competitive nature of the Commercial Horticulture Grants Scheme combined with the scheme&rsquo;s flexibility and ability to react to evolving situations are two key strengths in supporting this highly dynamic sector.</p>  <p>  Growers, including amenity plant nurseries that wish to apply for the scheme are encouraged to prepare and submit their applications as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  In terms of other supports for the sector I would also like to add that the &ldquo;SBCI Loan Scheme&rdquo; launched in last year&rsquo;s budget was a great success and a number of horticultural businesses have benefitted from these low interest loans.  As part of the recent Budget, &euro;25 million has been secured to facilitate the development of a new Brexit response loan scheme for farmers, fishermen, and food businesses in 2018 and further details about that scheme will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

The closed period for slurry spreading as provided for in the regulations commenced on 15 October.  Taking account of the high rainfall in the lead up to the commencement of the closed period, the DHPLG and my Department recognised that there may be some concerns for animal welfare.  Farmers with such concerns were advised to contact the Nitrates Section of my Department by 14 October.  Farmers wishing to avail of flexibility for spreading slurry were advised:</p>  <p>  - To spread only that volume  of slurry necessary to ensure adequate storage capacity for the remainder of the closed period.</p>  <p>  - That any spreading should occur as soon as good spreading conditions exist.</p>  <p>  - That the Nitrates Section of my Department will subsequently contact the farmers to confirm the dates  on which this additional spreading takes place. </p>  <p>  Approximately 600 farmers out of a total of 109,000 bovine farmers in the State contacted my Department to indicate they may not be able to complete the spreading of slurry by the beginning of the closed period.  We are in the process of confirming how many of these 600 farmers have had to avail of this limited flexibility.  These farmers will be prioritised for inspection by Local Authorities to ensure that minimum storage requirements are in place. </p>  <p>  We are currently negotiating the next Nitrates Action Programme and Nitrates Derogation and it is critical that these negotiations progress and we avoid the difficulties encountered in other Member states such as Holland.  In this context and to ensure the protection of water quality, this course of action is deemed necessary; those farmers with the required storage capacity availing of this flexibility should not have reason for concern.</p>  <p>  As regards farm safety and slurry, both Departments stress the importance of farmers ensuring that safety is their number one priority as toxic gases are released when slurry is agitated and one breath at this time can cause instant death.  All of those working with slurry should be aware of the dangers involved and make sure they work safely at all times.</p></reply>

This reflects a comparable level to that reported in 2016.  These notices are issued as a result of inspections carried out by Department Field Officers or on receipt of reports made by the public.  Follow-up action may be undertaken by</p>  <p>  Departmental officials with the land owner to ensure that the notifications are acted upon and that the particular weeds have been dealt with as stipulated in the Notice to Destroy. </p>  <p>  My Department seeks to engage with all County Councils, Local Authorities and the National Roads Authority to ensure a consistent programme of treatment and disposal of such weeds on an ongoing basis.  In this regard, my Department was in contact with each of the County and Local Authorities in the Country earlier this year emphasising their statutory obligation and  the importance of implementing measures for the treatment and safe disposal of ragwort in order to eliminate and prevent the spread of same.</p>  <p>  On the issue of any impact of an infestation of ragwort on farmers&rsquo; area-based schemes payments, farmers are obliged to keep their lands free from noxious weeds under the cross-compliance measures set down for farming practices  Failure to do so can result in the application of a reduction of their payment entitlement. EU Regulations governing the various area-based Direct Payments Schemes, e.g. Basic Payment Scheme, Greening, and Rural Development measures, call for applicants to comply with Cross- Compliance requirements relating to the 13 Statutory Management Requirements (SMR&rsquo;s) and the 7 Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) standards. GAEC Standard 7 requires applicants to ensure that they take appropriate measures to prevent the encroachment/proliferation of noxious weeds/invasive plant species onto land.  While 2017 statistics are not currently available, during 2016, a total of 89 sanctions were undertaken which resulted in the application of 65 such penalties.</p>  <p>  While the Noxious Weeds Act makes provision for taking prosecutions against offenders, this measure has not been resorted to in recent years.  Modern farming has reached a level of specialisation and intensification which makes weed control a fundamental and automatic practice.  However, the prevalence of ragwort found along the margins of roadways and in locations such as derelict sites regrettably appears to have increased.</p></reply>

The ECA&rsquo;s role as the EU&rsquo;s independent external auditor is to check that EU funds are correctly accounted for, are raised and  spent in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations and have achieved value for money.</p>  <p>  As an independent auditor, the ECA must remain separate from the influence of any Member State. It selects specific tasks at its own discretion and formulates its audit plan on the basis of criteria such as public interest, risk of irregularity or poor performance and potential for improvement. The ECA has recently made the decision to examine whether Member States have made effective contributions to the European Union&rsquo;s animal welfare objectives and whether compliance has been achieved with animal welfare legislation. This move constitutes the first ever dedicated assessment of animal welfare measures taken by the EU Commission and Member States.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that five countries - Germany, France, Romania, Italy and Poland - be assessed in this current programme, with audit reports from the ECA expected to issue in late 2018. These inspections will focus specifically on policies relating to farm animals, with scrutiny to be applied not only to on-farm conditions but also to other important components of the industry such as transport and slaughter. Legislation on pet animals, as distinct from farmed animals, has not been developed at EU level but is among the topics suggested for discussion at the EU Platform on Animal Welfare.</p>  <p>  The European Union has always ensured that animal welfare issues are assigned the highest priority. It has reinforced policy objectives with significant Rural Development contributions under the Common Agricultural Policy, which will contribute &euro;1.5 billion to animal welfare payments from 2014 to 2020. I feel that this proposed ECA audit plan is an important development and displays both to worldwide markets, and to our own citizens, that animal welfare is a cornerstone of the EU Agriculture model.</p>  <p>  While Ireland has not been selected for an audit on this occasion, officials of my Department are ready to facilitate and engage with members of any ECA audit team which may be assigned to this jurisdiction at a future date.</p></reply>

Applications for agroforestry are considered for silvopastoral systems for example, pasture/grazing/silage/hay.  However, other systems may be considered on a site to site basis as long as the tree stocking rate is between 400-1000 trees per hectare, it is at least 0.5 of a hectare in area and at least 20 meters wide.  The trees will be thinned out in time reducing numbers to between 160-250 trees per hectare, this will allow enough light to filter through the canopy enabling continued grass growth.  Acceptable tree species include oak, sycamore and cherry.  Other broadleaves and conifers will be considered on a site to site basis.  Fruit and nut species can account for up to 15% of the trees planted.</p>  <p>  Support for the establishment of demonstration plots for research purposes may also be considered under the afforestation scheme in the context of the Department&rsquo;s research programme.</p>  <p>  The Forestry Programme 2014 -2020 introduced a new requirement with regard to the planting of native woodlands alongside water courses. Native woodlands must be included alongside aquatic buffer zones in water sensitive sites such as aquatic Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and sensitive fisheries areas. This will provide a filtration buffer zone slowing down runoff from upland areas and helping to prevent sediment reaching rivers and streams. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s new environmental requirements also allows for limited planting within water setback areas.  This comprises the planting of single, small groups and irregular belts of native species such as birch, rowan, oak and Scots pine, as site conditions allow. Strategic planting within water setbacks may help to deliver direct in-stream ecosystem services such as bank stabilisation, cooling/shading, and food drop into the aquatic ecosystem. Water setback planting must be agreed in advance with Inland Fisheries Ireland and (where relevant) the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  </p>  <p>  In addition, native woodland is actively encouraged and financially supported by my Department and this includes riparian woodland.</p></reply>

The laboratories also provide valued services and advisory support to the farming community, the food industry and wider society.</p>  <p>  The ambitious targets of the Agrifood industry for growth and development over the next decade, as set out in Food Wise 2025, must be underpinned by robust systems which protect and enhance our reputation as a producer of safe and wholesome food and one of the ways in which we must respond to this challenge is by developing a long-term strategy for the laboratories - building on existing capability and expertise in animal health, food safety and plant sciences, and ensuring we achieve both operational and scientific excellence. </p>  <p>  This was the primary reason for tasking a Working Group led by Prof. Alan Reilly to undertake a comprehensive review of the Department&rsquo;s Laboratories.  This review has considered both the central laboratory complex at Backweston and the eight regional laboratories located at Athlone, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Sligo.   The Group has presented a report to the Department, which makes recommendations on: </p>  <p>  - Oversight and co-ordination of the laboratories activities </p>  <p>  - Re-organisation of Divisions and support functions within the Central Laboratory complex </p>  <p>  - Options for the future development of the Regional Laboratories &ndash; with a view to improving disease investigative and surveillance capability but with the over-riding imperative of maintaining and enhancing services to farmers and </p>  <p>  - Human resources management within the laboratories - with a focus on grading structures, career development opportunities and workforce planning </p>  <p>  To date no decision has been taken in respect of the options proposed for the Regional Veterinary Laboratories (RVLs). My Department completed an initial consultative process with all relevant stakeholders on the Working Group report (including on the options for RVLs) earlier this year. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the various options proposed will be undertaken shortly.  My Department has tendered for independent economic expertise to carry out this CBA and a tender award notice has issued.   Any decision I make on the RVLs, including Sligo, will be informed by the consultative process and the outcome of the cost-benefit analysis.</p></reply>

I convened the first formal meeting of the Committee on 7 July 2016 and I have held three subsequent meetings. </p>  <p>  This process was complemented by the All-Island Civic Dialogue process organised by the then Taoiseach. Under that process I hosted six sector-specific gatherings covering fourteen different sectors, including fisheries. These engagements afforded me and my Department the opportunity to hear, at first hand, the difficulties and concerns of the sectors; and given that the process was an all island one, I had an opportunity to engage with stakeholders from Northern Ireland also.</p>  <p>  I have also engaged with my counterparts in many other Member States in an effort to raise their awareness of the potential impact of an unfavourable Brexit agreement - or no agreement - not only on Ireland but on the EU agrifood sector generally. In this regard there is regular engagement with the Commission, the UK, including Northern Ireland, and other member states both at political and official level.  I have had specific bilateral meetings with my counterparts in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Estonia, Poland, France, Luxembourg, Austria, Belgium and Spain to seek to establish common ground on the Brexit issue.  </p>  <p>  I have had political engagement with the former NI Minister for Agriculture Michelle McIlveen, the former UK Secretary of State for DEFRA Andrea Leadsom and the UK Minister of State for Agriculture George Eustice. I have spoken by telephone with DEFRA&rsquo;s current Secretary of State, Michael Gove, and am meeting him in Dublin shortly. In all of these engagements I have emphasised, and will continue to emphasise, the potential impact a hard Brexit will have on the historical trading relationships between the two jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  While the main impact to date of the Brexit vote has been the effect of sterling volatility on those businesses that have a significant trading relationship with the UK, the medium to long term threats include the possible introduction of tariffs on trade between the EU and UK, potential divergences in regulations and standards between the EU and UK, and the implications of border controls and certification requirements. </p>  <p>  I and my Department, in cooperation with Government and other Departments and Agencies, are attempting to mitigate the consequences through a range of activities under two distinctive pillars &ndash; Competitiveness and Product/Market Diversification.</p>  <p>  Under Competitiveness my Department introduced a number of measures in Budget 2017 to help minimise farm gate and business costs, including the introduction of &euro;150m low cost loan scheme for primary producers, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes.  Under Budget 2018 I have provided exchequer funding to support a &euro;300m Brexit loan scheme, at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses, and my Department is working with SBCI to develop a similar scheme for primary producers and small businesses.</p>  <p>  Under Product/Market Diversification I continue to support Bord Bia in its investment in market prioritisation initiatives, which are aimed at identifying potential diversification opportunities.  Since the final quarter of 2016 I have provided Bord Bia with more than &euro;14 million in additional funding for a programme of marketing and promotional activity in international and EU markets, and also in the UK.  </p>  <p>  I have also allocated an additional &euro;2m to Teagasc to allow them to commence work on an &euro;8.8m investment in a new National Food Innovation Hub which will help Irish food businesses to innovate and expand.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that I and the Government remain very focused on supporting the agrifood industry through the challenges ahead. I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs or burdensome customs and administrative procedures.</p></reply>

Due to the ongoing simplification and modernisation programme of the existing CAP, it is unlikely that a mid term review of the existing CAP will now take place.</p>  <p>  Since the 16th October 2015, the maximum amount payable to any one applicant under the Basic Payment Scheme in Ireland (excluding the Greening Payment) is capped at &euro;150,000 per annum and this option is set down in Regulation 1307/2013, which establishes the current rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the current CAP.  Ireland actively supported the concept of a maximum level during the current CAP negotiations back in 2013.  A further lowering of the limit would require a legislative change of the Basic Act 1307/2013 (Direct Payments Regulation) in Council.</p>  <p>  I am however committed to addressing this matter in the context of the future reform of the CAP, with the Commission scheduled to publish a communication on CAP post 2020, on 29 November 2017.</p></reply>

My focus now is on ensuring that payments to these participants are processed and my Department is working hard to begin making these 2017 advance payments in the coming weeks.  The GLAS scheme is one of a suite of many RDP schemes and the re-opening of any scheme can only be considered within the overall RDP budget which is currently fully committed.</p>  <p>  All GLAS applications must pass regulatory controls and validations as is the case with all EU co-funded schemes. Each application must pass the full suite of checks before it can be approved for payment. </p>  <p>  The main issue holding up the payment of outstanding 2016 claims which will also hold up 2017 advance payments is the fact that some participants have not yet submitted a Nutrient Management Plan (NMP). This is a core requirement of participation in GLAS. As of November 3rd there were 5,275 NMPs outstanding.  I urge all GLAS participants to attend to this urgently so that outstanding balancing payments and future payments can issue and to ensure ongoing participation in the GLAS Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Every effort is being made in order to ensure that payments are issued without delay.

I believe that this could not be coming at a worse time for the EU beef sector. </p>  <p>  I and my officials have been very active in highlighting the potentially very damaging impact of a Mercosur deal on the European agriculture sector, and on the beef sector in particular. We continue to monitor the situation closely and respond as appropriate to developments in order to defend the interests of Irish farmers, working in close co-operation with my Government colleagues, particularly the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  At political level, I have continuously raised the issue with my Member State colleagues and with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstr&ouml;m, both within the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in written form.  These efforts have been reinforced at official level through similar contacts with Member States and the Commission, particularly through the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Trade Policy Committee.  The Taoiseach has also raised the matter with Presidents Junker and Macron.</p>  <p>  Most recently Ireland made the latest in a series of very strong interventions on this matter at the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels on 27 October, and I raised the matter at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg in October and again in Brussels this week.  I have also worked very closely with a number of other Member States, most notably France, including in the production of a joint paper that was submitted to the European Commission on 26 September outlining our shared concerns.  And I wrote to Commissioner Malmstroem in early October reiterating my concerns in relation to the tabling of a beef tariff rate quota offer by the EU during the most recent round of negotiations.</p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector.  In this regard I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agrifood sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.</p></reply>

Increasing and sustaining foreign direct investment (FDI) outside of our main urban areas - including in Counties Meath and Louth - represents a vital part of this. </p><p>Drogheda remains an attractive destination for FDI given its track record as a home to multinational companies, the excellent local infrastructure and its proximity to Dublin and the capital's transport hubs.  The wider Meath and Louth areas also benefit from these advantages, which helps explain why there are a total of 38 IDA client companies employing over 5,000 people in the two counties combined. </p><p>The IDA continues to seek new investment for the Drogheda area.  The Agency has a Business Park in the town which is already home to one client and which could support further investment.  The sites available at that Park are actively marketed to overseas companies. Information on those companies that may be considered potential investors cannot, however, be released on grounds of confidentiality and commercial sensitivity.  </p><p>Two IDA client companies which have confirmed new investment for Drogheda in recent years are Kelton Tech and Mobile Technologies Inc.  These businesses have indicated they plan on creating 250 jobs in the town and the IDA hopes that further such investment can be secured for Drogheda in the time ahead. </p><p>The following table sets out details on the number of site visits to counties Meath and Louth from 2013 to quarter three of this year. <table><tr><th>County</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>Q3 2017</th></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>24</td><td>14</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These improvements include:</p><p>- Reorganising the structures of the Office;</p><p>- Recruiting additional expertise, most notably six forensic accountants and a digital forensics specialist;</p><p>- Fundamentally amending the investigative procedures used by the Office, with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now taking the lead on all criminal investigations; and</p><p>- Fostering a greater culture of risk management.</p><p>The structure and operation of the new Agency will build on these important advances and incorporate lessons learned in recent years.</p><p>The decision to establish the ODCE as a new independent agency will give the Director greater autonomy and flexibility and ensure that the Agency  is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.</p><p>In addition, the new Agency will be established in line with international best practice, including its internal controls, staffing, budget and corporate governance etc.  My Department will engage with the OECD to seek their assistance in taking account of international best practice in the establishment of the Agency.</p><p>Furthermore, the Companies Act 2014 enshrines substantial and wide-ranging powers for the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Government is committed to ensuring that the Companies Act 2014 continues to deliver a robust yet competitive corporate regulatory framework for business in Ireland. Consequently, the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 are under continuous review.</p><p>Any further powers that are identified as a requirement for carrying out the functions of the Agency will be explored and made under statute as appropriate.</p><p>The Government remains committed to refining and developing Ireland&rsquo;s response to criminal activity and regulatory crime and ensure that, like every other jurisdiction, we continue to respond to emerging challenges.  This recently launched package of measures to combat &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo; is designed to both strengthen and further review what is required to tackle such crimes.</p></reply>

HBFI will be a standalone entity which will provide funding directly into the market. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that HBFI would not be directly involved in development as suggested by the Deputy's question. Its role would be solely as a commercial lender akin to a bank or private equity investor.  HBFI will be lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions, which would depend on the risk profile of each individual project, the quality of collateral and the creditworthiness of the borrower.</p>  <p>  With a proposed allocation of up to &euro;750m, it is estimated that HBFI could have capacity to fund about 6,000 homes in the coming years depending on demand in the market.  The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, HBFI, with an annual average delivery of up to 2,000 homes, would reduce this shortfall by about 10% (assuming a three year horizon).  This would be a significant contribution but it would not make HBFI a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development.</p></reply>

The issue of below cost selling is a matter in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  The prohibition on below cost selling was removed when the Groceries Order was abolished in 2006 by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It was removed to spur greater competition into the grocery trade by allowing retailers freedom to determine how they price their products.  Any moves to directly prohibit this practice would possibly be contrary to EU State Aid rules.  </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may be aware that, in respect of the price of alcohol, my colleague the Minister for Health is currently bringing forward legislation to tackle the issue of cheap alcohol.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill contains a provision for a minimum price on each unit of alcohol sold, regardless of the point of sale.  This should go some way to addressing issues arising from the sale of cheap alcohol.</p></reply>

The purpose of the consultation process and report is to assist the Government in its analysis of local public banking in an Irish context.  My Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, now the Department of Community and Rural Development, were tasked with fulfilling this Programme for a Partnership Government commitment. </p>  <p>  The investigation of local public banking has consisted of a consultation process with stakeholders and interested parties, including the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC).  Officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development and my department have met with representatives from SBFIC a number of times.  Officials have been provided with a detailed proposal and presentation on the Sparkasse model and its potential implementation in an Irish context by SBFIC. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that officials in my Department are working jointly with colleagues in the Department of Community and Rural Development in order to prepare a report of the findings of their investigation.  It is expected that the report will be completed in the near future.  It will describe the current Irish banking environment, outline the Sparkasse and Kiwibank business models, detail the proposal for local public banking in Ireland received from Irish Rural Link and SBFIC, summarise the views of respondents to the consultation process and set out findings in relation to the potential for a local public banking model in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The completed report will be presented jointly to the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring T.D., and myself.  The report will then be brought to Government, for Cabinet Approval. Once the report has been brought to Government, a copy will be provided to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, and Reform and Taoiseach.</p></reply>

These relate to adjustments raised by tax authorities in Tax Treaty partner countries in respect of transfer-pricing or the attribution of profits to permanent establishments. Some of these cases are at an early stage and Revenue has not yet received sufficient information to estimate the potential Irish tax relief that could result from closing the cases.  For those cases where the potential relief is known, the maximum aggregate tax value of the relief could amount to &euro;243m.  However, while this aggregate value is based on granting relief for the full foreign adjustments, the total relief ultimately granted is likely to be less, as a result of the withdrawal or reduction of the foreign adjustments concerned on the conclusion of the MAP negotiations.  </p><p>The following table includes the number of MAP requests made by companies for each of the years 2008 to 2016 and to date in 2017, together with the number of requests where tax relief was granted and the tax value of the relief involved:<table><tr><th>Year of MAP request</th><th>Number of requests received for MAP assistance</th><th>Number of these requests where relief granted</th><th>Tax value of relief involved *</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>2</td><td>1 (1 case was withdrawn)</td><td>**</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>6</td><td>4 (1 case where no relief was granted, and 1 case is still   open)</td><td>&euro;6.6m</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>9</td><td>3 (4 cases were withdrawn, 1 case where no relief was   granted, and 1 case is still open)</td><td>&euro;3.5m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>4</td><td>2 (1 case was withdrawn, and 1 case where no relief was   granted)</td><td>&euro;0.9m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>5</td><td>2 (2 cases were withdrawn, and 1 case is still open)</td><td>&euro;0.1m</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>7</td><td>4 (1 case was withdrawn, and 2 cases are still open)</td><td>&euro;4.8m</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>12</td><td>2 (1 case was withdrawn, 1 case where no relief was   granted, and 8 cases are still open)</td><td>&euro;4.7m</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>8</td><td>1 (2 cases were withdrawn, 1 case where no relief was   granted, and 4 cases are still open)</td><td>**</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>8</td><td>3 (5 cases are still open)</td><td>&euro;1.8m</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>8</td><td>0 (1 case was withdrawn, and 7 cases are still open)</td><td>&euro;0.0m</td></tr></table></p><p>* Relief may be granted over a number of years and may take the form of increasing losses to be carried forward as well as refunds and off-sets. </p><p>** As there is only one case involved, publication of the amount of tax relief granted is not considered appropriate as it could lead to identification of the company. </p><p>With respect to Question No. 47307/17, a bilateral Advance Pricing Arrangement, referred to as a bilateral APA, is a binding agreement between two tax administrations, which is entered into by reference to the relevant Double Taxation Agreement. A bilateral APA governs the treatment for tax purposes of future transactions between associated taxpayers for a fixed period, generally 3 to 5 years. </p><p>I am informed by Revenue that there are 4 APAs currently in place with other countries. The APAs relate to 4 separate Irish companies. To observe taxpayer confidentiality, the OECD approach when reporting statistics is not to identify individual countries where there is a small number of agreements with those countries.  The four current APAs have been agreed by Revenue with the tax administrations of two OECD countries and there are two agreements with each of these countries.</p></reply>

These appeals fall into three categories:</p>  <p>  (i) Those that have been notified directly to the TAC, following its establishment in March 2016;</p>  <p>  (ii) Those that were submitted to the Revenue Commissioners prior to the commencement of the TAC and which transferred to the TAC during 2016</p>  <p>  (iii) Those that were on hand in the Office of the Appeal Commissioners prior to establishment of the TAC and which automatically transferred to the TAC.</p>  <p>  The appeals in categories (ii) and (iii) above make up a substantial amount of the current casework in the TAC and I am advised that much of the delay in progressing those matters towards settlement, has been outside of the TAC&rsquo;s control.</p>  <p>  I am advised that not all appeals are of the same complexity or magnitude. Therefore it is to be expected that consideration of larger and more complex appeals may take more time than others which can, or will move towards settlement, more quickly.  That being the case, I am advised that  it is unlikely that the current appeals will take 17 years to settle.  I am also advised, by the TAC, that now its new case management system is almost fully functional, the Commission is getting to a position where it can run more case management conferences and more leader/follower appeals, whereby in the first instance, some appeals may be settled more quickly because of earlier interaction with the TAC; and in the second instance, more appeals may settle by virtue of the outcome in a &ldquo;leader&rdquo; case, which has bearing on all the &ldquo;follower&rdquo; appeals.  I am further advised that this desired outcome is already taking effect, with appeals settling or closing this week, on foot of case management conferences.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I am mindful that it is also the case that there are a large number of appeals to be settled and more being notified each month. Although a reasonable timeframe for settling all must be allowed, I accept that the TAC needs additional resources to ensure an efficient and effective appeals process is available to taxpayers.  A new, temporary Commissioner has been appointed to deal with the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; cases and I am advised that a series of case management conferences, dealing with a large volume of those appeals, have begun and will continue through December.  The TAC anticipates that these conferences will result in many of the appeals settling or closing at that stage.  Likewise, a series of these conferences are being scheduled for December, in respect of &ldquo;current&rdquo; appeals.  In addition, the Commission has identified procedural improvements which it considers may help to expedite appeals and I am advised it has requested a review of some of its proposals by the Office of the Attorney General and awaits a response.  Furthermore, the TAC has put proposals to my Department in relation to additional resources &ndash; staff and facilities - and addressing these issues quickly will, I understand from the Commission, lead to an improvement in terms of the rate and timing of appeals being settled or closed.</p></reply>

Indeed, it has always been the case that a large number of appeals are settled by agreement between the parties rather than by being determined by the Appeal Commissioners. Such settlement discussions routinely involve a professional adviser retained by the taxpayer in question. This type of settlement, however, is more likely where the dispute involves the amount of a tax liability or there is a difference of opinion in relation to the facts of a case. There are many cases where there is no potential for informal settlement, in particular with appeals that involve the determination of a point of law. </p>  <p>  The Appeal Commissioners were specifically recruited because of their expertise and ability to adjudicate and determine disputes involving complex tax matters.  It is appropriate that tax disputes involving points of law and complex tax matters continue to be determined by them, where the matter cannot be resolved directly between the parties.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that Revenue&rsquo;s understanding of arbitration is that an independent arbitrator makes a decision in a dispute that is binding on all parties.  Revenue does not consider that this would be appropriate in the context of complex tax disputes.  In certain cases, where Revenue does not agree with the determination of the TAC, and the matter may create a precedent that has significant implications for the Exchequer, it is important Revenue has the option of appealing  the determination to the Courts.</p></reply>

The key objective of the actions in the Plan was to &ldquo;manage the Public Service property portfolio in a professional, co-ordinated and efficient manner that maximises value for money and facilitates business needs and service provision&rdquo;.</p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW), with its Chairman as the Delivery Plan&rsquo;s <i>Senior Responsible Officer</i>, led the development of the Plan.  A Steering Group comprising public property stakeholders was established to oversee progress on the delivery of the actions by across the participating State bodies.</p><p>Significant progress was made in the implementation of the Delivery Plan actions, as reported in the <i>Final Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 (July 2017)</i>.  The utility and further development of certain outputs, under many of the actions, is continuing after the designated Reform Plan timeframe.</p><p>One of those outputs that will require continued maintenance and development is the Intra-State Property Register.  The Register currently has basic details on over 24,000 owned or leased properties by 94 individual organisations, including Central Government, Local Government, the HSE and Non-Commercial State organisations.  These properties, in the main, are office and other buildings used by State organisations in the exercise of their functions.  There are gaps in the data relating to individual properties.  The register is a work-in-progress and efforts are continuing to improve the accuracy of the data on the Register and to fill the gaps where data is missing.</p><p>The Intra-State Register is one of a number of inter-linked outputs under the Delivery Plan that provide a platform for a more integrated and strategic management of the State&rsquo;s Property portfolio.  The intention is that holders of State property assets should increasingly view property from a more strategic, State point of view rather than an individual or organisation viewpoint.  When an organisation has a property for disposal, the first method of disposal to be considered is the transfer of the surplus property to another State organisation.  The State Property Register facilitates this prioritised method of disposal by obliging State organisations with <b><i>surplus</i></b>property to identify it as such on the Register, and allow other State organisations a minimum of one month to express an interest. It is for this reason that the State Property Register records that a property is &lsquo;<b><i>surplus</i></b>to requirements&rsquo; <b><i>rather than &lsquo;vacant&rsquo;</i></b>.</p><p>I think that there is an important distinction between these two classifications, as &lsquo;surplus to requirements&rsquo; indicates that the decision has been made to dispose, which is unlikely to match the number of properties that are vacant but not surplus to requirements.  The Register does not record vacant properties.</p><p>It is important to note that while the OPW hosts the Register, the properties and the data are the responsibility of each of the 94 State organisations.  Each organisation is responsible for the efficient management of those properties.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circulars issued under the Delivery Plan outline the need for regular review of an organisation&rsquo;s property needs; and the use of appropriate appraisal processes for all decisions related to the acquisition, disposal and retention of property to ensure that the best use is made of State property assets to achieve value for money.</p><p>I understand that the Housing Delivery Office in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government did undertake an exercise to identify those State and semi-State lands that were deemed surplus to requirements in urban areas where housing pressures are most acute.  The exercise involved consultation with the various State and semi-State bodies including the OPW.  The results of this exercise are on the Rebuilding Ireland website.</p><p>My officials in the OPW regularly review our own property portfolio to identify any properties that might be surplus.  In the past year, a number of properties have transferred from the OPW to other State bodies to assist in alleviating homelessness.</p></reply>

This allocation primarily covers the costs of implementing flood defence capital works and the ongoing maintenance programme for completed Arterial Drainage Schemes.  The 2018 total allocation includes a provision of &euro;70m approximately for expenditure on flood defence works which is an increase of some &euro;25m over the 2017 allocation.  This significant increase is part of the commitment of &euro;430 million for flood risk management under the Government's six year Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 which will see the annual allocation for flood defence expenditure rise from &euro;45m currently to &euro;100million by 2021.</p>  <p>  The 2018 allocation will allow the OPW to continue with its existing programme of major flood relief schemes which currently has ten schemes at construction with another 26 at different stages of design or planning.  Over the next 12 months, the OPW hopes to commence the construction of another nine major schemes from this programme with a total value of over &euro;230 million and these, along with the rest of the schemes in the programme will, when completed, provide flood protection to approximately 12,000 properties.</p>  <p>  The 2018 allocation will allow for the continuation of the OPW's Minor Flood Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This successful Scheme has allowed approximately 650 small scale local authority projects to be approved for funding at a cost of &euro;40million, with completed projects to date providing flood protection to over 6,200 properties.</p>  <p>  The OPW will also soon have completed its Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) studies which have been undertaken throughout the country over the last number of years and which have concentrated on the areas of most significant flood risk.  It is expected that the resultant Flood Risk Management Plans will be published in the near future once they have been approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Plans contain proposed flood defence works for approximately 140 additional areas at a projected cost of close to &euro;600million and the projects arising from these Plans will start to be implemented on a prioritised basis from next year onwards.</p>  <p>  Approximately 100 of these projects will be major schemes with the remainder falling into the minor works category which will enable the relevant Local Authorities to advance them reasonably quickly with funding being provided by the OPW.</p></reply>

The impact of Brexit on Ireland will depend on the outcome of the complex negotiations still underway.  While this poses challenges in planning our response, it is important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is in a strong position to deal with these challenges.</p>  <p>  In recent years we have seen economic growth becoming more firmly established, and our public finances have remained on a sustainable path.  As set out on Budget Day this year, 2018 will be the fourth successive year in which we will be able to increase expenditure on public services and infrastructure.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to protect and consolidate the progress that has been made to date.  Consequently, it is important to maintain a focus not just on the level of expenditure, but also on how public funds are being spent.  In this context the Spending Review process allows for the systematic examination of existing spending programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives.</p>  <p>  On Budget day in October I announced an additional allocation of capital expenditure of &euro;4.3 billion over the next four years, up to the end of our existing Capital Plan in 2021.  This additional allocation is central to our response to Brexit and will allow our State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects over the medium term, while also ensuring communities and businesses can plan ahead.  This additional funding has been allocated following the review of the Capital Plan, with this review providing an evidence base, reflecting sectoral gaps identified by robust analysis.</p>  <p>  Supporting the areas of our economy that may be significantly impacted by Brexit will be a key element of the Government&rsquo;s response.  To this end, as outlined in the Expenditure Report 2018, additional expenditure amounts have been specifically allocated to provide for Brexit related measures across a number of Departments including: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation; the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  Education, as well as delivering benefits for the individual and for society, is also vital to keeping our economy competitive and attracting investment in a post-Brexit world.  Continued investment in education remains a priority of this Government.  The allocation for Education in 2018 of over &euro;10 billion represents a new peak for the sector and over 16&frac12; per cent of total gross voted expenditure.</p>  <p>  In addition to expenditure measures, there are also a number of whole-of-Government arrangements already in place as part of our response to Brexit, such as the Cabinet Committee chaired by the Taoiseach.  We are also strengthening our relevant Departments, Agencies and overseas missions to ensure that they have the necessary capacity, capabilities and expertise to address the issues that may arise as a result of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.</p><p>The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p><p>The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0017/2017.</p><p>Firhouse Educate Together National School submitted an application to the April and October meeting of the Appeals Board under three separate Criterion, Accommodation, Class Size and Developing.  The Appeals Board determined that these appeals did not warrant the allocation of additional posts for the 2017/18 school year on confirmation of pupil enrolments on the 30<sup>th</sup>September 2017.</p><p>The Staffing Schedule also includes a separate provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  The school referred to by the Deputy was successful in being granted one additional post on developing grounds for the 2017/18 school year based on confirmed enrolments.  The school has been notified accordingly.</p><p>The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>In relation to the new model for the allocation of Special Education Teachers to schools, DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017.</p><p>The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p><p>The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.</p><p>Included within this is an allocation for:</p><p>- A school educational profile component; which includes:</p><p>- An allocation for pupils with complex needs.</p><p>- The learning support needs in schools as evidenced by attainment levels in standardised test results.</p><p>- The social context of the school including disadvantage and gender.</p><p>- Baseline component provided to every mainstream school to support inclusion, prevention of learning difficulties and early intervention.</p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. </p><p>The special education teaching allocation provided for this school for 2017/18 was 48.05 hours.</p><p>The profiling model had indicated a profiled special educational need for this school, relative to that of other schools, of 47.50 teaching hours.</p><p>However, as no school received an allocation, on the introduction of the new model, which was less than the allocation they received in the previous school year, the school maintained an allocation of 48.05 hours and it was indicated that within this allocation there was a retained element of 0.55 hrs.</p><p>Where a school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year additional allocations may be made.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).</p><p>Schools who qualified for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.</p><p>Firhouse NS school was provided with an additional net SEN allocation of 2.45 hours on the grounds that the school qualified for one additional developing mainstream teaching post.</p><p>The school received a revised total special education teaching allocation of 50.5 hours.</p><p>This allocation equates to over 2 full time additional Special Education Teachers.</p><p>It is acknowledged and accepted that schools will have some additional pupils with special educational needs enrolling to their school subsequent to the profiles having been developed.</p><p>However, for the most part these will be balanced by the fact that some students who had additional teaching needs in the previous year will have left the school.  The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils.</p><p>The additional allocations made where schools qualify for developing mainstream teaching posts take account of growing enrolments.</p><p>It is also acknowledged that there will be some schools where exceptional circumstances may arise.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will also be available to support schools where schools have developed and implemented appropriate plans for the deployment of their special education needs teaching resources, but the school considers that further support may be required.  This support may involve Continuing Professional Development or further training for school staff, advice in relation to the support plans that are in place, and possibly a review process once schools can clearly demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have arisen in the school.</p><p>The NCSE has now published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.</p><p>Should this school consider that they fulfil the criteria for a review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances, details of this review process are available at:</p><p>.</p></reply>

My Department has no control over the allocation process to schools and is not in a position to influence the allocation process in light of the fact that the NCSE is an independent statutory body. A school&rsquo;s allocation can increase or decrease and where schools receive a reduced allocation this can be for a variety of factors, such as pupils for whom the school had previously received an allocation have left, or have declining care needs.  In light of this, the employment of SNAs may be reduced from full-time to part-time or may be terminated by way of redundancy where the approved allocation of the school is reduced.</p><p>Where a full-time SNA post within a school is reduced to a part-time post, the issue of redundancy payment in respect of the loss of hours may arise.  Redundancy arrangements for SNAs are set out in Department Circular 0058/2006.</p><p>In addition, as per the provisions of the Supplementary Assignment Arrangements for SNAs which were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed and which continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement, where a school/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours/posts, then that additional allocation of hours/posts must be offered to any existing part-time SNAs in that employment, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to recruitment.  These arrangements are set out in Department Circular 0042/2017 (which can be accessed via the link ).</p><p>On 5<sup>th</sup>July 2017, I announced that 975 additional SNAs were to be allocated to schools over the period September to December 2017, a 7.5% increase in SNA numbers in order to meet the level of assessed demand.  This announcement brings the total number of SNAs to 13,990, representing an increase in the total numbers of SNAs of 32%, from 10,575 to 13,990 since 2011.</p><p>In addition, and as announced as part of Budget 2018, funding is being allocated for the recruitment of over 1,090 new SNAs in 2018 (based on current forecasts), including some 130 posts which will be filled in the period between January and June next year, with the remainder being appointed from September 2018.  This brings the total number of SNAs to over 15,000 (a 43% increase since 2011).</p><p>While reduced hours or redundancies will unavoidably occur in individual schools due to a variety of circumstances, these increases in SNA numbers coupled with the operation of the Supplementary Assignment Panel Arrangements make it more likely that SNAs can avoid redundancy and that part-time SNAs can gain or regain full-time employment.</p></reply>

Section 37 of the Education Act 1998 provides the statutory basis for Education Support Centres and outlines the policy framework underpinning their recognition and functions, funding, staffing and governance. The Act empowers me as Minister to make regulations relating to the operation of centres including the appointment and remuneration of staff which includes the post of director.</p>  <p>  The regulations I recently promulgated under Section 37(6) of the Education Act underpins my Department's policy for the secondment of teachers to Education Support Centres. These regulations comply with relevant legal and policy requirements.  Accordingly, there are no plans to change the approach.</p>  <p>  By way of background, my Department arranges for the secondment of teachers from their teaching posts for the purpose of developing and providing CPD for teachers and for the appointment as Directors of Education Support Centres (ESC's). Secondments are a temporary arrangement renewable on a year to year basis. While on secondment, teachers retain their school post, the terms and conditions that apply to teachers and receive their salary and a secondment allowance which are met in full by my Department.</p>  <p>  In 2010, a new policy of secondment was introduced which included a new limit on secondment numbers and established an upper limit of 5 years on the length of a secondment, following which the Directors return to their posts either as a teacher or an inspector.  The policy was agreed by the then Minister for Finance Mr Brian Lenihan T.D.</p>  <p>  There are many benefits from the revised policy for teachers, their boards of management and the system as a whole.  Because an upper limit of 5 years now applies to secondments, there is:</p>  <p>- confidence that the teachers involved in the delivery of CPD have recent experience of the curriculum and of the school environment</p>  <p>- certainty about secondment parameters which assist individual teachers and their boards of management in planning.</p>  <p>  There are more opportunities for teachers to take on career enhancing roles in the support services and the Centres. Teachers returning to their school after a period of secondment have the potential to enrich their school environment and they become eligible to take on subsequent secondment opportunities after a period back in their school.</p>  <p>  Regular turnover of seconded teachers is now an established practice with teachers returning to enrich their schools so the investment in their skills is not lost.  Since 2010, 10 Education Centres have successfully recruited new Directors and the work of the Centres has not been negatively affected.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Sligo/ Leitrim Division, on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 297, 8 of which are community Garda&iacute;. There are also<b></b>18 Garda Reserves and 28 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has, in its Programme for a Partnership Government, recognised the importance of community policing.  It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community throughout the country in order to provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  This commitment is underlined by very significant investments in Garda resources.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country.</p><p>Furthermore, the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  All Garda&iacute; have a role to play in Community Policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.</p><p>I am advised that Community policing continues to be a key aspect of the Garda approach to the prevention and detection of crime. Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of community based groups, as well in more formal settings such as Joint Policing Committees, to ensure that local issues can be aired and appropriate partnerships formed with communities to address matters of concern. Garda&iacute; also support over 3,700 Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes nationwide, and these form an important partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent crime and protect communities, especially the elderly and more vulnerable persons. In addition, the Garda Text Alert Scheme provides an effective means for Garda&iacute; to communicate crime prevention information to local communities.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.</p><p>Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. In addition, there are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>In conclusion, all Garda activities, including community policing, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme, and in particular the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers so that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country and into the future.</p><p>To be of further assistance to the Deputy, I have requested a report on this matter from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I will contact him again when I receive this report.</p></reply>

Patients apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the State through model form E112.  Subject to the EU Regulations and Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state through the issue of form E112 (IE) where the treatment is:</p>  <p>  -  Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation; </p>  <p>  -  Not available in Ireland; and</p>  <p>  -  Not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease.</p>  <p>  Applications to TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment.  The statutory framework stipulates the patient must be a public patient and is required to have followed public patient pathways.  GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS.  The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend. </p>  <p>  Each application is reviewed individually and a decision is made in accordance with the legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts. Each application is given a formal written decision and where a decision is one of decline, the reason for that decision is clearly outlined and the option of an appeal is afforded.  Previous approvals or declines are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications.  The appeals process is outlined in each decline letter without exception.  Where on appeal a decline decision is upheld, the appeal decision letter advises that the applicant can make a further appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.  Full details on the scheme can be found on the HSE website at www.hse.ie/treatmentabroadscheme.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that no application has been received in relation to this individual.</p></reply>

The organisation's awareness raising and information provision along with their support of polio survivors at work and in the home, is recognised as a vital support to survivors.  In 2017, the organisation received funding in the region of &euro;356,000 from the HSE under Section 39 of the Health Act, 2004, to support the work of the organisation.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) funds a range of health and personal social services and supports, incorporating hospital, primary care and community services, to enable each individual with a disability, including polio survivors, to achieve their full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are accessed based on need and delivered in a variety of community and residential settings, in partnership with service users, their families and carers, and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.</p>  <p>  My Department has no plans to introduce an allowance for polio survivors to access physiotherapy services.  However, physiotherapy services form part of the services provided by many Primary Care Teams and, in particular, physiotherapists play a key role in chronic disease management, especially in instructing and guiding patients through safe and appropriate exercise regimes.  Physiotherapy services for adults are also delivered through specialist disability providers.  I have asked the Health Service Executive to provide the Deputy with details regarding the health and personal social services provided to polio survivors.</p></reply>

The Department supports the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR (2015) and the European Commission One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance (June 2017).</p>  <p>  A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years including improved surveillance of infections and prescribing, infection prevention and control processes, antimicrobial stewardship initiatives, public and professional awareness raising and with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.</p>  <p>  In response to the emergence of virulent antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, in particular CPE or CRE, commonly known as 'superbugs', the HSE National Taskforce on HCAI AMR, established in late 2015, identified an urgent need to develop a comprehensive plan in response to the on-going and developing situation in relation to management of CPE within the healthcare system.  A national response team was established and a new National Clinical Lead for HCAI AMR was appointed to direct the work of the response team.</p>  <p>  In addition, on the considered advice of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) I activated the Public Health Emergency Plan on 25 October 2017 to further address CPE in our health system.  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on CPE, chaired by the CMO, has been convened and had its first meeting on 2 November last.   Membership of the team will include key stakeholders from the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE) management with responsibility for public health, surveillance, operations and quality assurance and patient representatives.  NPHET will meet on a weekly basis and continually evaluate the readiness of the health service to manage and sustain the containment of CPE as part of ordinary operations with a view to standing down the National Public Health Emergency Team at the appropriate time.  The National Public Health Emergency Team will direct and ensure an effective communications system at local, regional and national levels.  Regular updates including summary minutes of meetings will be via a dedicated web page, hosted on the Department of Health website.</p>  <p>  Ireland's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020 (iNAP) was launched on Wednesday, 25 October last.  The Plan, jointly launched by myself as Minister for Health and Minister Michael Creed TD, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been a cross-Departmental initiative, requiring a cross sectorial and whole of Government approach to addressing the world wide threat of AMR.</p>  <p>  iNAP was developed following the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR which required all countries to have in place a national action plan by mid-2017 and by the European Commission which also required Member States to develop a national action plan by mid-2017.  The Plan has been prepared by both Government Departments, with the guidance of the National  Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee.  This ambitious 3-year Plan has been developed in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and covers the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as human health - taking a 'One Health' approach to tackling AMR, encompassing all sectors.  The Plan lists Strategic Interventions and Activities, responsible bodies and priority rankings of timelines for implementation.  An implementation plan will be developed separately which will address means of tackling AMR as appropriate to each sector.  The National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) will discuss arrangements for progressing this body of work with the HSE's HCAI National Lead and relevant others; DAFM are establishing an AMR implementation plan team to oversee its body of work in addressing the interventions and activities listed proper to the agriculture and environment sectors.</p>  <p>  iNAP aims to ensure the development and implementation of multifaceted interventions which will safeguard against inappropriate prescribing, dispensing and consumption of medicines, while simultaneously promoting rational use in patients and animals that are expected to benefit from treatment.</p>  <p>  Ireland is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at national, European and International levels to this end.</p></reply>

No. 125 of 2016) establishes a point system, which will apply to the Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy is detected.  It is intended that the new Statutory instrument which I intend to sign shortly will replace S.I. No. 125 of 2016 to change the make-up of the Determination Panel set up under the 2016 S.I. to determine if on the balance of probabilities a serious infringement occurred and whether it is a serious infringement.  This will involve the appointment of three independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General, thereby completely separating the enforcement and the determination functions.  The new SI will, to the extent possible, take on board the issues of concern in relation to procedures and processes highlighted in High Court judgments on this matter.  It will also address certain minor technical and drafting issues arising in S.I. No. 125 of 2016 .</p>  <p>  In June 2016, I advised the Oireachtas that subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues, that I was hopeful of moving towards a system of sequential application of EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process, having consulted with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I made it clear that this move was subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues in order to ensure compliance with EU law.  </p>  <p>  There has been extensive examination and consideration of all the issues in relation to meeting our EU obligations to implement the points system in the interim period.  The firm legal view available to me is that it is not possible to deliver on an effective and dissuasive points system, as required under EU law, by assigning points to licence holders upon successful prosecution.</p>  <p>  In relation to stakeholder consultation, I discussed with industry representatives my plans to bring forward a new SI at the Sea Fisheries Liaison Group meeting on 20 October 2017 and explained the amendments I am planning and the justification for these amendments. </p>  <p>  Under the new S.I., the licence holder may appeal on a point of law a decision of the independent fisheries Adjudicator to the High Court.  In the 2014 S.I. (which was struck down by the Courts and replaced by the 2016 SI), this appeal was &ldquo;final and conclusive&rdquo; &ndash; this aspect of the provision has been removed.</p>  <p>  It should be noted in this context that Pilot Infringement proceedings by the EU Commission for non-implementation of the EU points system have been taken against Ireland.  It remains an option for the EU Commission to proceed to formal infringement proceedings in respect of the licence holders system. </p>  <p>  There are also serious implications with regard to the release of funding under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).  Implementation of the EU Points system was an ex-ante conditionality for the approval of Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime Fisheries Fund Programme, given that the programme is intended to facilitate implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy in Ireland.  The EU Commission has signalled in writing that the delivery of funding under Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF Operational Programme is firmly linked to the implementation of the points system.  This programme is investing &euro;241m of EU/Exchequer funding in total in the fisheries sector over the lifetime of the programme, which is crucial at a time of Brexit uncertainty.  The immediate concern is with regard to the control and data collection funds.  The EU Commission wrote in July 2017 advising that due to the non implementation of the Points system, EMFF funding allocated for control spend will be suspended.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the determination of a serious infringements, the S.I. (Regulation 3 of SI No. 125 of 2016) defines &ldquo;serious infringement&rdquo; as "...an infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy mentioned in Annex XXX to the Commission Regulation that is determined by the Determination Panel, on the balance of probabilities, to be serious having regard to the criteria and guidance notes referred to in Regulation 6(3)."</p>  <p>  Regulation 3 also provides that &ldquo;Commission Regulation&rdquo; means Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1962 of 28 October 2015.</p>  <p>  Regulation 6(3) referred to above provides that "The SFPA may issue guidance notes, which shall be published on its website on the internet, for the purpose of providing practical guidance in identifying the criteria, for the purpose of these Regulations, the Control Regulation and the Commission Regulation, employed in determining whether an infringement is a serious infringement."</p>  <p>  It is intended that the new SI will feature the same definitions.  As stated above, it is envisaged that it will be for the new Determination Panel established under the new SI to determine if on the balance of probabilities a serious infringement occurred and whether it is a serious infringement.  </p>  <p>  Having an effective, proportionate and dissuasive system of points for all fishing vessels, Irish and non Irish, operating in our 200 mile zone is beneficial to maintaining the sustainability of fish stocks on which our seafood sector is dependant.  This system will ensure that the vast majority of our law abiding fishermen are able to compete effectively and look forward to a sustainable future in the industry.</p></reply>

It is clear that the weather conditions over the past number of weeks has been challenging and this has created difficulties for farmers in parts of the country, particularly in the Western and North Western regions. </p>  <p>  Grass growth rates through September and October were ahead of recent years.  Data from Pasturebase Ireland indicates that production is running about 1 tonne dry matter per hectare ahead of last year.  Notwithstanding this, grazing conditions did deteriorate from mid August on farms in the Western regions and on heavier land.  This has given farmers a number of challenging weeks managing livestock with animals having to be temporarily housed and difficulties with securing later cut silage.  I note that there appears to be reasonable supplies of feed and fodder available across the country at present.  However, I have asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties, to support the need for good budgeting of fodder supplies on farms for the winter ahead and into 2018.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission agreed to my request for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme.  This has been prompted by the protracted inclement weather conditions and also market difficulties caused by currency fluctuations.  This means an increase from 50% to 70% in the advance payment rate for the BPS to those applicants whose applications were confirmed fully clear.  These payments were recently issued, and balancing payments will be made with effect from early December.  There will also be an increase permitted to the advance for Pillar II Rural Development schemes.</p>  <p>  These payments and the payments under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, are injecting up to &euro;800 million into the Irish rural economy and will provide a very welcome boost for Irish farm families, and also funding for fodder and feed  purchase where required. </p>  <p>  Taking account of this, there are no plans at this time to establish a fodder aid scheme.

I am very aware of the importance of these supports for farmers, and accordingly the issuing of payments under these schemes is a matter of priority for my Department.</p><p>The main schemes are delivered under the framework of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, and each year approximately &euro;1.5bn issues under these schemes.  My Department has a strong record in the efficient delivery of these payments, as evidenced by the fact that we perform very favourably compared to other EU Member States in terms of both the dates on which payments are delivered and our ability to maximise the drawdown of available EU funding.</p><p>In terms of the individual schemes, the main Direct Payment scheme is the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).  Advance payments commenced on 16 October this year, which is the first date permissible under the EU Regulations.  In all,  an advance payment worth some &euro;700 million issued to 111,000 farmers on the first pay run, representing an increase from the 109,000 farmers paid at the same stage in 2016.</p><p>The Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme commenced payment on schedule again this year.  In the week beginning 18th September, payments in excess of &euro;160 million issued to over 75,000 farmers, representing a significant increase over the 65,000 paid at the same stage in 2016. </p><p>In both the BPS and ANC schemes, payments have continued to issue as additional cases have become clear for payment and the current position with those schemes is that for BPS 116,500 applicants have now been paid &euro;755 million and for ANC over 86,600 applicants have been paid &euro;186 million.</p><p>With regard to GLAS, all applications must pass regulatory controls and validations before payment can issue.  Payments are due to commence issuing to applicants in the coming weeks.  I do not expect any payment delays where everything in the application is found to be in order.</p><p>The TAMS II Scheme has been very successful to date in terms of uptake with the number of approvals that have issued to date exceeding 11,600.  All of these approvals represent committed expenditure under the TAMS II measure of the Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020. </p><p>Of the applications approved just over 2,500 payment claims have been received to date, representing 21% of approvals.  Payment claims submitted have been paid in over 75% of cases and these continue to be paid on an on- going basis.  However, until such time as the works applied for and approved have been completed and payment claims submitted, payments cannot issue. </p><p>All participants who have completed approved works are urged to submit their payment claims immediately to facilitate early payment.</p><p>Organic Farm Scheme payments in 2015 and 2016 amounted to &euro;8m each year. Projected expenditure for 2017 is &euro;13m and the average payment is approximately &euro;6,500. It is expected that 2016 balancing payments will issue this month.  </p><p>Payments have now commenced on the Knowledge Transfer Programme.  The initial payment runs relate to cases where all Year 1 requirements have been fully met by the farmer &ndash; cases where all requirements have been only partially met or where inspections are ongoing will follow shortly. Given the structure of the scheme, farmer payments are now rolling out on a sector by sector basis as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>SECTOR And PAYEE</th></tr><tr><td>KT   Sheep &ndash; farmer payment - Payment issued</td></tr><tr><td>KT   Beef &ndash; farmer payment - Payment issued</td></tr><tr><td>KT   Dairy &ndash; farmer payment November 2017</td></tr><tr><td>KT   Tillage &ndash; farmer payment November 2017</td></tr><tr><td>KT   Equine &ndash; farmer payment November 2017</td></tr><tr><td>KT   Poultry &ndash; farmer participant November 2017</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition to the above schemes, advance payments at a rate of 85% are due to issue later this month to participants in the new Sheep Welfare Scheme. </p><p>In relation to all these EU funded schemes, it is important to note that EU regulations stipulate that payments can only issue when the required validation checks have been carried out and passed.  I am very anxious to ensure that my Department continues to issue these important payments to farmers in the most efficient and timely manner possible, and this remains a key priority for me.</p></reply>

This is particularly true in the agrifood sector, given its overwhelming dependence on export trade.  Against this background, Ireland is broadly supportive of balanced trade liberalisation, provided our most vulnerable sectors, including beef, are protected. </p>  <p>  Where agri food products are imported from third countries, such imports are  governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance.  Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.  Veterinary checks are carried out on consignments of foods imported from Third countries outside the EU.  Consignments are subject to documentary, identity and physical checks, including sampling of products, carried out in accordance with European regulations at Border Inspection Posts.</p>  <p>  Any  evaluation of future trade deals should take account of the EU Commission&rsquo;s assessment of the cumulative impact on the agri food sector, and of the potentially negative impact of Brexit on EU agriculture.  In the context of discussions on a potential trade deal with Mercosur,  I have worked with a number of other member states to mobilise opposition to the inclusion by the Commission of a beef tariff rate quota in its recent offer to Mercosur countries, and in this context will continue to ensure that the interests of Irish  beef farmers are protected.</p></reply>

The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.</p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.  These checks include physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.</p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety, to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.

I am glad to say that Michel Barnier and the relevant Member States are as  determined as Ireland in that regard.</p>  <p>  Existing access arrangements and percentage shares of fish stocks have been agreed by all EU Member States, including the UK, over many years and were most recently affirmed in 2014 when the current Common Fisheries Policy came into force.

This work has been carried out by my Department, the Marine Institute and BIM  in close cooperation with the fishing industry.</p>  <p>  At EU level there have been, and will continue to be, regular contacts with the Barnier Task Force, Fisheries Commissioner Vella and like-minded Member States at all levels.  In all of these contacts I have stressed the importance of a unified EU front and our determination to maintain all of our current rights.  This is a view shared by all of those Member States that have rights in the UK zone.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I aim to ensure that fisheries are inextricably linked to overall discussions on the totality of the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.</p></reply>

Some 24 of these enterprises (16%) had revenues over &euro;10 million, 52 (33%) had revenues between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million and 80 (51%) had revenues of less than &euro;1 million.  The growth and increasing scale of the processing sector can be seen when comparing this to 1999, when only 11 enterprises had revenues of over &pound;5 million, 8 had revenues of between &pound;3 - &pound;5 million, and 6 enterprises had revenues of between &pound;1 - &pound;3 million.    </p>  <p>  Our seafood sector (domestic and export) was valued at &euro;945 million in 2016.  This figure represents a 33% increase from a value of &euro;712 million in 2010.  The value of our seafood exports increased by 47%, or &euro;180 million, to &euro;559 million in the same period.  Underpinning this growth is the value-add of seafood, which has seen the average unit price of seafood exports increase from &euro;1.67 to &euro;2.71 over the period from 2010 to 2016. </p>  <p>  To assist our seafood processing sector in achieving its growth potential in the years ahead, and informed by Food Wise 2025, the Government is focussed on encouraging the sector to add value to fish raw material through increased innovation and development of new consumer products, encouraging the sector to further enhance its scale to make it more competitive on world markets, and encouraging the development and diversification of our export markets.  My Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme is providing the development funding for these objectives and Bord Iascaigh Mhara is delivering those EMFF supports through the Seafood Innovation, Seafood Scaling and Seafood Capital Investment Schemes, while Bord Bia is significantly expanding its seafood promotion programme.</p></reply>

My Department plays a part in the enforcement of this legislation along with Competent Authorities in other Member States, other Irish Government departments and State Agencies such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and the Health Service Executive. </p>  <p>  The importation of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.  Veterinary checks are carried out on consignments of foods imported from Third countries.  Consignments are subject to documentary, identity and physical checks, including sampling of products, carried out in accordance with European regulations.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.  Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by my Department ensure that European standards are not detrimentally affected by imports from third countries.</p></reply>

I convened the first formal meeting of the Committee on 7 July 2016 and I have held three subsequent meetings. </p>  <p>  In the 2017 Budget I provided seed funding for  a &euro;150m loan scheme for primary producers and in the 2018 Budget I am supporting new &euro;300m loan scheme for SMEs, at least 40% of which will be made available to food businesses.  I have also secured funding of &euro;25 million for 2018  to allow my Department develop a low cost loan scheme for farmers, fishermen and food businesses similar to the 2017 scheme.</p>  <p>  I have also provided an additional &euro;14m for Bord Bia since the end of 2016 and my department has intensified its efforts, including through a programme of trade missions, to ensure that Irish food products have access to as many international markets as possible. </p>  <p>  In relation to Mercosur, I  have been very active in highlighting the potentially very damaging impact of a bad deal on the European beef sector.  At political level, I have raised the issue with Member State colleagues and with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstr&ouml;m, and within the Council of Agriculture Ministers as recently as yesterday, and the Taoiseach has raised the matter with Presidents Macron and Juncker. </p>  <p>  On CAP, Ireland will continue to argue for a strong  budget and continued commitment to the provision of support for family farms. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that I will continue to engage closely with stakeholders, including farm bodies, and remain focused on supporting the agrifood industry through the challenges ahead.</p></reply>

In addition to these value increases, a target was set for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020, to be progressed following the abolition of milk quotas in April 2015.  Progress on those targets is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The latest data available show growth of 36% for both primary production and exports (based on 2016 data), and 47% for value added (latest available data 2014), versus the baseline period, demonstrating excellent progress.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025, the latest ten year strategy for the agrifood sector published in July 2015, is the successor to the Food Harvest strategy.  It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectorial recommendations. </p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee, which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy, believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.  With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agrifood sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development. </p>  <p>  In July this year, I launched the second annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2017.  This showed that, of the 368 detailed actions which were due to commence by 2017 or are on-going actions; 46% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 49% have commenced and are progressing well. </p>  <p>  I will host a Food Wise Conference in Croke Park on 4th December which will acknowledge the achievements of the Irish agrifood sector in terms of innovative, sustainable growth over recent years; and consider how the Food Wise process can lead a dynamic, collaborative response to future opportunities and challenges.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding challenges on the horizon, amongst which Brexit is paramount, stakeholders in the Irish dairy sector are well placed to benefit from expanding global demand.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Ireland exported in the region of &euro;4bn in dairy products to approaching 130 countries.  Against the backdrop of EU agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada and Japan, my Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain access to new 3rd country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish dairy products. In many instances such efforts are on foot of trade missions at Ministerial level. Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agrifood exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  In addition, against the background of Brexit, I have asked Bord Bia to conduct market profiling exercise to identify opportunities in new and more mature markets, and the output of this exercise will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers. </p>  <p>  Most recent CSO data available for the year to end August showed that growth in Irish dairy exports exceed 20% ahead of the same period in 2016, on foot of factors such as improving global prices, particularly evident in sectors such as butter, but also increases in volumes exported across a range of product categories. This demonstrates that our aforementioned efforts are contributing positively to Irish dairy sector exports. </p>  <p>  While global demand for dairy products remains strong, the quality of Irish sourced milk is a key competitive advantage in our promotional efforts in new and existing markets. Investment in research and innovation, improvements in on-farm practices, and the development of added-value products are key priorities for Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector.  My Department will continue to review opportunities for growth in the sector, in collaboration with industry stakeholders. </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I and Minister Doyle led trade missions to China, Singapore, Vietnam and South Korea in September 2016. In November 2016 I also led a trade mission to Morocco, which was extended at senior official level to include Algeria. Earlier in 2016, senior officials accompanied a Bord Bia trade mission to Iran. </p>  <p>  In February 2017 I also led a very successful Trade Mission to the Gulf Region.  This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  More recently, in June of this year I led an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico, and will be leading a trade mission to Japan and South Korea later this week.</p>  <p>  Such missions serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  They also promote Ireland's reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced dairy products. </p>  <p>  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy. It has enviable natural resources, adaptable and resilient producers, a strong international reputation, an effective dairy processing sector and a strong core of research infrastructure and expertise. My Department and I will continue to work with our partners in the dairy sector and with EU colleagues and international counterparts to ensure the development and maintenance of a sustainable dairy sector in Ireland.</p></reply>

Indigenous production of cereals is of course an important part of primary agriculture production.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of seed production, grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector.  The long-term average cereal production in Ireland is in the region of 2.2 million tonnes per annum and it is desirable to sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.  </p>  <p>  The 2017 harvest is estimated by Teagasc to be in the region of 2.1 million tonnes, despite a decrease in the area devoted to tillage.  This is mainly due to the availability of new improved varieties capable of higher yields and thereby helping to sustain a viable tillage sector.  Cereal prices are highly sensitive to global supply and demand and volatility in prices is likely to remain a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future; grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies.  I nonetheless acknowledge the continued tight margins experienced by growers and the challenges facing the sector, as global production due to higher yields continues to outstrip demand. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware of a number of measures I introduced in this regard to sustain the tillage sector and promote its growth in the future.  Among these measures was a targeted crop loss support measure to assist growers most affected by the wet weather harvest conditions of September 2016. </p>  <p>  In addition to this measure I also introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and extended it to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors.  I have been advised by the banks that all of the &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of a new Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and food businesses in 2018.  Further details will be announced in due course.  </p>  <p>As additional support to tillage farmers I also introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II earlier this year.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The closing date for applications under the second tranche of the new scheme was Friday 06th   October 2017.  There was a significant level of interest in investments under this measure with a total number of 687 applications received to date.  457 approvals have now issued in respect of the first tranche and payments and approvals are issuing on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the level of production, quality and viability of the Irish cereal sector.  These services include seed certification, seed testing, crop variety testing and the publication of recommended lists of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; competitive research programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme.  In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers.

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness, as well as specific sectorial recommendations.

The Act puts clear obligations on owners regarding the need to look after animals under their care.  Under the Act, authorised officer status has been given to a small number of employees of the ISPCA, DSPCA and the Turf Club to carry out duties limited to welfare.</p>  <p>  My Department employs a large team of veterinary inspectors to enforce the provisions of the Act.  Inspections, both announced and unannounced, are undertaken on a regular basis to ensure that the requirements of the Act are strictly adhered to.  These inspections are scheduled on both a random and targeted basis.  My Department also operates an anonymous helpline through which members of the public can express animal welfare concerns.  These reports are promptly examined by trained veterinary staff countrywide and corrective action is taken in those cases where the Act has been breached.  The Act also provides for severe penalties in the event of successful prosecutions.</p>  <p>  The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) was established by my Department in February 2002 on a non-statutory basis.  It has been instrumental in promoting animal welfare in a practical way and providing a forum for different interest groups to meet, exchange views and reach consensus on the various challenges relating to animal welfare on farms.</p>  <p>  While my Department remains the central reporting point for animal welfare concerns, it also works collaboratively on a range of issues with the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Under Section 37(2) of the Animal Health and Welfare Act, 2013, the manager of a local authority may appoint authorised officers to exercise functions conferred on them for the purposes of enforcing the Act.</p>  <p>  One area of such co-operation is the governance of canine welfare.  A joint inspection regime of dog breeding establishments, involving the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Local Authority Veterinary Service, took place in 2015 for the purpose of inspection and follow up action.  While a very high percentage of inspections found the conditions of the animals to comply fully with the Act, corrective action was taken where necessary following the discovery of individual cases of non-compliance (mainly infrastructural in nature).</p>  <p>  My Department also liaises on a daily basis with Local Authorities in relation to the enforcement of the Control of Horses Act 1996.  In order to reduce the numbers of straying horses, my Department has provided funding to a number of local authorities to support the development of urban/traveller horse projects in their respective areas.  A number of projects are currently being progressed by local authorities in conjunction with animal welfare organisations.  These projects provide many benefits to communities including educational elements which enable greater compliance with animal welfare regulations thereby reducing numbers of straying horses.  My Department continues to stress that it is the responsibility of individuals to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership and/or their care and to dispose of them appropriately.  I am glad to report a major improvement in horse welfare outcomes in recent years.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Region Horse Welfare Group has recently been instigated by South Dublin County Council to directly address equine issues within the greater Dublin area.  I welcome this initiative and my Department will work closely with our partners in Local Authorities, Welfare Groups and An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to achieve its aims.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be assured that this level of monitoring, enforcement and education will remain in place in the future, both by my Department and the various agencies of the State.</p></reply>

However, during this period the Irish Government&rsquo;s position will continue to be to minimise the impact of Brexit on existing trade for all our food exports including mushrooms.  As part of this process I have established a dedicated unit within my Department to consider and prepare for the direct impact of Brexit on our agri-food industry.</p>  <p>  I am committed to working with the mushroom sector to assist it in adjusting to the challenges that lie ahead.  My Department and its State Agencies currently provide supports on a number of fronts.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Budget provided for a new &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; which will provide affordable, flexible finance to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future.  The new Brexit Loan Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses (up to 499 employees).  This will give Brexit-impacted businesses, including potentially a number of mushroom exporters, time and space to adapt and to grow into the future.</p>  <p>  Due to State Aid legislation the Brexit Loan Scheme announced in Budget 2018 will not be available to primary producers including mushroom growers.  In light of this I have secured &euro;25 million in funding for my Department to facilitate the development of a new Brexit response loan scheme for farmers, fishermen and food businesses in 2018 and further details on this will be announced in due course.</p>  <p>  For the wider horticultural sector the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector continues to be the main support for individual growers in the horticulture industry who wish to make capital investments in specialised equipment or buildings.  I'm delighted to confirm that Budget 2018 allocated &euro;5m in funding again for the Scheme in 2018, further reflecting this Government's commitment to ongoing support for the sector.  The competitive nature of this scheme combined with its flexibility and ability to react to evolving situations are two key strengths in supporting this highly dynamic sector.  An early opening of the scheme is anticipated.</p>  <p>  The EU Producer Organisation (PO) scheme is also a vital support, with around 80% of Irish mushroom growers in a producer organisation at present.  This scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base.  In addition, this scheme is funding a number of initiatives to improve competitiveness, including Lean Training for mushroom growers.  Indeed the concentration of supply through the PO Scheme has allowed exporters in many cases to negotiate Sterling price rises from their UK customers in response to the weakening of Sterling.  Other contracts now have an inbuilt mechanism to protect against Sterling volatility or are based in Euro.</p>  <p>  I can also confirm that starting in January 2018 An Bord Bia will commence a 3-year mushroom promotion campaign on the Irish and UK markets.  This campaign will be co-funded by the industry and the European Commission.  It is important to emphasise that the overall market for mushrooms in the UK and Ireland remains strong, showing good potential for further growth.  This new promotion campaign will build on the success of previous similar initiatives and develop that growth in potential to increase exports.</p></reply>

The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes.</p>  <p>  The uncertainty around Brexit is a challenge for the sector, but concerns about the impact on the agri-food sector are at the top of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit agenda.  Our ongoing consultation with stakeholders, together with our engagement with UK, Northern Ireland and EU counterparts, will be informed by the need to have the implications for the agri-food sector understood and taken account of as the negotiations unfold.  My Department and State agencies are working together to ensure that the short-term and longer term impacts of Brexit are taken into consideration, and that appropriate supports are in place to help the sector to respond and adapt to the new realities.</p>  <p>  With regard to farm incomes and volatility, Teagasc's National Farm Survey 2016 showed average farm income of &euro;24,000.  Average farm income has been relatively stable over the last few years, fluctuating between &euro;24,000 and &euro;26,000.  However, there are significant differences in farm income depending on the farming system and size of farm.  It should  also be borne in mind that over 60% of the farms represented by the National Farm Survey are classified as part-time, based on labour input required.  On half of farms, either the holder and/or spouse has off-farm employment.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance on key agri-taxation policy objectives, including responses to income and price volatility.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its food production, and therefore will always feel the effects of volatility on world markets.  Dairy farms, which have significantly higher incomes on average than other farming systems, also experience greater income volatility.  The introduction of fixed price contracts by some processors is increasingly becoming a feature of the producer/processor relationship in the dairy sector, with numerous milk purchasers offering such contracts, which provide producers with the opportunity to lock in prices over the medium term, taking costs of production into account.  Such relationships are a welcome development in terms of their potential to mitigate volatility.</p>  <p>  One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; was such a mechanism and was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), making &euro;150 million available to farmers this year at interest rates of 2.95%.  There has been a very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.</p>  <p>  The new Brexit Loan Scheme announced in Budget 2018, based on the template of the Agri Cashflow Loan scheme, aims to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses.  Given their unique exposure to the UK market, my Department&rsquo;s funding (&euro;9 million out of total public funding of &euro;23 million) ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses.  Due to State Aid rules, this scheme will not be available to farmers and fishermen.  However, my Department has secured funding of &euro;25 million to facilitate the development of further Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and food businesses in 2018.  Further details will be announced in due course.</p>  <p>  I am confident that my Department is taking every step to support measures which mitigate price volatility and improve competitiveness in the sector.</p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment must also satisfy a means test.  All non-contributory recipients are accepted as satisfying this means test.</p>  <p>  A fuel applicant and members of his/her household may have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;100 a week above the appropriate rate of State Pension Contributory and qualify for a payment.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  The &euro;100 a week means limit is significantly higher that the weekly fuel allowance rate of &euro;22.50 and also the combined weekly total of household benefits and fuel allowance added together (&euro;33.65).</p>  <p>  Fuel applicants must also satisfy the household composition criteria, i.e., they must live alone or only with the following:</p>  <p>  - a qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren);</p>  <p>  - a person in receipt of a qualifying payment who would  be entitled to the allowance in their own right;</p>  <p>  - a person who is receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in respect of providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant or their qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren);</p>  <p>  - a person receiving short term Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) or Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (less than 391 days for JA and less than 15months/456 days for Basic SWA).</p>  <p>  Therefore a social welfare dependant who is living with someone other than those listed above would not be entitled to the fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines for the Fuel Allowance Scheme are kept under review.  However, any decision to change the household composition requirement and to increase the combined assessable income for a household would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs due to ill health or infirmity.  Exceptional needs payments may also be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which a person is unable to meet from his/her own resources.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This campaign was also designed:</p>  <p>  - To help raise overall awareness of the consequences of welfare fraud and the positive role that can be played by members of the public in supporting the Department in its work; and</p>  <p>  - To remind customers to contact the Department if their circumstances change, thereby helping to reduce and prevent customer errors in claims, as well as deliberate fraud.</p>  <p>   It is important to note that the advertising campaign commenced in April this year and, therefore, statistics to date would not be indicative of the overall results of the campaign, nor do these statistics alone reflect the complete set of objectives set for the campaign.  The success will also be measured by behaviour and attitudinal changes to welfare fraud also and public awareness of fraud reporting services.</p>  <p>  The number of reports registered to the end of September stood at just over 16,500, compared to just over 13,900 in the same period last year, an increase of 19% approximately.</p>  <p>  It is the policy of my Department to examine all reports of reported suspected fraud and abuse.  Of the overall numbers received to end September, close to 14,000 have been examined and following the initial stages of examination, close to 9,000 have been referred for further investigation and appropriate follow-up action.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a payment is not suspended or stopped solely on the basis of a report received.  The report provides a &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; for the instigation of a review of a specific entitlement and further investigation if that is considered to be warranted.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that anonymous reports are not available to Deciding Officers when they are making their decisions on cases.  The Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision must be based on the full facts and circumstances of the case and, as a result, statistics are not available on the outcome of anonymous reports.  Furthermore, anonymous or confidential reports of abuse do not form any part of the evidence when a case is being considered for prosecution.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The results of this research are a useful contribution to analysis on the issue of income adequacy in general.  This research is an adaptation of the VBSJ&rsquo;s studies on the minimum   essential standard of living for the general population, which have estimated the level of income needed to meet an individual's / household's physical, psychological and social needs, and which is calculated by identifying the goods and services required by different household types in order to meet these minimum needs. </p>  <p>  The findings show that the cost of an MESL is estimated to be higher for a person with vision impairment than for members of the general population who have full sight.  Overall, the additional cost in 2016 for an individual with vision impairment was &euro;44. 54 more than the cost for a single adult in the main MESL (&euro;241. 22).  </p>  <p>People with vision impairment who require income support can apply to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection   for a blind person&rsquo;s pension.  This is the only scheme for a specific disability operated by the Department and was introduced almost 100 years ago in 1920.  To be eligible for this payment, the applicant must satisfy a number of conditions set down by legislation:  be at least 18 years of age and under the pension age; be so blind that he or she either cannot perform any work for which eyesight is essential or cannot continue his or her ordinary occupation, satisfy a means test, and satisfy the habitual residency condition.  </p>  <p>  There are currently some 1,280 people in receipt of a blind person&rsquo;s pension at a cost of some &euro;13. 5 million in 2017.  </p>  <p>Alternatively, the disability allowance payment can be claimed by a person with vision impairment   which substantially restricts them in undertaking suitable employment.  The current rate of payment for both the blind person&rsquo;s pension and the disability allowance is &euro;193 per week for a single person.  Budget 2018  provides an additional &euro;5 per week for each of these payments, bringing the rate up to &euro;198 per week next year.  </p>  <p>  Primary weekly social welfare payments are intended to enable recipients to meet their basic day-to-day income needs.   Recipients may also be entitled to a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash, which are considered secondary in nature.  In this regard, recipients of the blind person&rsquo;s pension or disability allowance may also be entitled to a free travel pass and the household benefits package.  In addition to these, I understand that the Health Service Executive operates a supplement means-tested scheme &ndash; the blind welfare allowance &ndash; for blind people receiving certain welfare payments, including the blind pension.  The current rate of payment is &euro;58. 50 per week for a single person.  </p>  <p>  Any further increases in the rates of primary and secondary payments to persons with disabilities including those with vision impairment would have to be considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p></reply>

The Bill provides for Irish Water to make refunds to customers who paid domestic water charges since 1 January 2015. In making the refunds the guiding principle for Irish Water will be to make refunds directly to the account holder. In the instance where a Management Company is the Irish Water account holder and where that company paid domestic water charges it will be necessary for the individuals concerned who paid their water charges through this medium to engage with the relevant management company.  I understand that Irish Water has, as part of the preparations for making refunds, engaged with the Residential Landlords Association of Ireland to ensure that the refund of domestic water charges operates as efficiently and effectively as possible in landlord/tenant situations.</p></reply>

Therefore, housing affordability has been examined by my Department, in consultation with the Housing Agency, local authorities and other stakeholders as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland. </p><p>The examination was carried out under the generally accepted premise that housing is deemed affordable where households, particularly low  or moderate income households, are paying no more than a third of their disposable income on meeting their accommodation needs.  </p><p>The work took account of the measures already taken to make housing more affordable. These include the  streamlined planning system for large-scale housing developments; reduced development contributions; the &euro;226 million LIHAF funding, the impact of Rent Pressure Zones and changes to apartment guidelines in 2015.  <b></b></p><p>It also took account of the additional housing affordability measures contained in Budget 2018. As announced, there will be a second phase of the LIHAF infrastructure fund with an Exchequer contribution of &euro;50 million to unlock additional lands for housing. </p><p>I have also secured funding of &euro;25 million, to be provided over 2018 and 2019, to unlock local authority owned land specifically to deliver affordable housing. Local authorities have already worked very successfully with co-operative housing bodies in delivering infrastructure on local authority owned sites so that co-operatives can make affordable housing available. This model is to be made available on a far greater scale. </p><p>The housing affordability examination is now at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to outline the outcome, including any additional measures, in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This phase consists of the deep retrofitting of 3 of the existing housing blocks to provide 63 refurbished apartments and 37 new build units, comprised of 28 apartments and 9 houses, to give an overall total of 100 new and refurbished units at a cost of &euro;25.5 million.  </p>  <p>  The regeneration of St Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens is also underway and significant funding has been provided to Dublin City Council for de-tenanting, enabling works and demolitions. The new build element will commence in 2018, with 50 social homes planned for phase 1. As with Dolphin House, the Government is committed to this regeneration project and to the beneficial change in living circumstances it will bring to the residents of the area. In addition, the national Regeneration Programme continues to be rolled out in other areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk. </p>  <p>  These projects are all yielding significant improvements to the housing conditions in the areas involved, as well as investing in social and economic programmes to support holistic improvements in the living circumstances of the areas&rsquo; residents. </p>  <p>  The importance of a preventative maintenance programme for social housing stock has been explicitly recognised in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan, under which all local authorities will adopt a preventative maintenance approach to housing stock management, including consistent standards and pro-active approaches, and adopt a common national re-letting performance standard.  </p>  <p>  Other remedies will also be considered to address the ECSR findings.</p></reply>
