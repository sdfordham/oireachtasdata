The INMO figures are also showing significant improvement in the second half of November. This contrasts with the position back in August when overcrowding was 40% up compared to August last year.  Recent progress is definitely in the right direction and a big improvement on the start of the year when there were 500 to 600 people on trolleys.  This Wednesday morning's TrolleyGar report showed 303 patients waiting on trolleys at 8am, with 117 of those patients waiting over 9 hours. The comparable figures for the same day last year were 409 patients on trolleys with 204 waiting over 9 hours, a drop of 26%.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;117 million has been provided in 2015 to relieve pressures on acute hospitals. This includes &euro;74 million provided in April which has supported significant progress to date on reducing delayed discharges freeing up just over 250 beds in our Acute Hospitals and lowering the waiting time for Fair Deal funding, as well as providing additional transitional care beds and home care packages to provide supports for those no longer needing acute hospital care. </p>  <p>  The HSE began its winter planning process early this year. In July, following consideration of proposals from hospitals to increase capacity, a further &euro;18 million was provided  to support the acute hospital system over the winter period by providing additional bed capacity and other initiatives to support access to care.  This additional funding included &euro;8 million capital funding which allows for renovation and reopening of wards, opening of additional acute beds, isolation rooms, rehabilitation beds and transitional care beds. </p>  <p>  There has been considerable capital investment in the upgrading and reconfiguration of Emergency Departments in recent years including:</p>  <p>  -  a new ED in Wexford General Hospital and St Luke's General Hospital  Kilkenny;</p>  <p>  -  a new ED and acute medical assessment unit in the Mater, which opened in 2013</p>  <p>  -  construction of a new ED underway in Limerick University Hospital, to be completed in 2016;</p>  <p>  -  newly refurbished and expanded adult ED and provision of a short stay observation unit in the paediatric ED at Tallaght;</p>  <p>  -  upgrade to South Tipperary General Hospital to provide additional treatment spaces;</p>  <p>  -  refurbishment of the ED at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan and</p>  <p>  -  refurbishment of the ED at Mullingar, providing improved facilities for care, to be finished in January 2016.</p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital is also undertaking a feasibility study on the location, size and cost of building a new ED at the hospital and a report on this is expected shortly.  All of these investments are intended to improve the experience of the thousands of people attending our Emergency Departments every day.</p></reply>

The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children in line with their prioritised needs. However, it is acknowledged that current waiting lists for some therapeutic supports are high.</p><p>In 2013, additional funding of &euro;20m was provided to strengthen primary care services. This comprised of &euro;18.5m for the recruitment of over 260 primary care team posts and over &euro;1.4m to support community intervention team development.</p><p>In 2014, the roll out of the<i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme </i>entailed targeted investment of &euro;4m and the provision of 80 additional therapy staff. A further &euro;4m allocation is being allocated in 2015 to continue work on this initiative.  The key objective of the <i>Progressing Disability Services Programme </i>is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  Full implementation of the <i>Programme</i>is expected before the end of 2016.</p><p>An additional &euro;8m will be provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy through primary care services and to support the reorganisation and expansion of therapy services under the <i>Progressing Disability Services Programme.</i></p><p>I am confident that the additional resources being invested into both primary care and disability services will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services to all children with disabilities, including those who may currently be on waiting lists to access therapy inputs. </p><p>The approved complement for the HSE Dublin South West Disability School Age Team has been increased to seven front line posts. While the two occupational therapist posts on the team are vacant, these are in the process of being recruited. The posts are expected to be filled by early next year.</p><p>In addition the HSE has informed me that the child referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is being provided with ten hours of home support by a Behaviour Support Specialist with the necessary input and oversight of Psychologists. The purpose of this arrangement is to provide support to the child and his parents and to develop a behaviour support plan. This arrangement has been in place since September 2015 and is being provided by a private provider contracted by the Executive.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-03a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120300030#WRA00900"><p>Improving access for patients is a key performance objective for our health services. In January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, I put in place maximum permissible waiting times for in-patient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year end.</p>  <p>  The HSE was provided with additional funding of &euro;51 million to ensure that these maximum waiting times would be achieved.  In June, the HSE reported a performance against the 18 month maxima of 99.6% for in-patient/day cases and 92% for outpatients. The latest National Treatment Purchase Fund figures, published on Friday 6 November, continue to show improvements. There are reductions in the total in-patient /day case waiting list, and in the numbers of patients waiting between 15 &ndash; 18 months and waiting over 18 months.  Outpatient improvements are also evident, with a reduction of almost 5,000 in the overall outpatient waiting lists and of over 3,000 in the number of people waiting between 15 &ndash; 18 months for appointments.  </p>  <p>  We are making progress in relation to emergency care and this is borne out by a reduction of 15%, or over 12,000 people on trolleys since 2011.  We are starting to see results from the implementation of the Emergency Task Force Plan and the investment of a further &euro;117 million provided to support the performance of the acute hospital system.  </p>  <p>  As mentioned previously, HSE figures are showing a 8% reduction in overcrowding this November compared to last. The INMO figures are also showing significant improvement in the second half of November. This contrasts with the position back in August when overcrowding was 40% up compared to August last year. Recent progress is definitely in the right direction and a big improvement on the start of the year when there were 500 to 600 people on trolleys.

The comparable figures for the same day last year were 409 patients on trolleys with 204 waiting over 9 hours, a drop of 26%.</p>  <p>  There is much more to do before we will have achieved timely access for patients to emergency and elective care but we are moving in the right direction.</p></reply>

While these treatments are provided by the HSE it is acknowledged that there is variation in the level of delivery across the country, including the South East region.</p>  <p>  In June this year I met with representatives of Lymphoedema Ireland, the HSE and my Department to discuss the supply of, and reimbursement for, compression bandages, the development of an adequate model of care and access to services for lymphoedema patients.  A subsequent meeting involving Lymphoedema Ireland and the HSE took place on 19 August.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has no plans to produce a report on lymphoedema services. However, in April this year the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme published a leaflet on prevention of clinical lymphoedema after cancer treatment. This leaflet focuses on the prevention, early detection and risk reduction of clinical lymphoedema after cancer treatment. It emphasises in particular the importance of early intervention in preventing the progression of lymphoedema in cancer patients. I am advised that new cases of lymphoedema linked to cancer are becoming less common due to improvements in cancer treatment.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently examining the issues raised by lymphoedema patients, in particular in relation to the provision of compression bandages. They are continuing to work closely with Lymphoedema Ireland and a follow-up meeting is planned for early next year.</p></reply>

The elective orthopaedics service for the North East is provided in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, with an outreach clinic in Cavan. </p>  <p>  Our Lady's Hospital, Navan provides a regional orthopaedic service for the counties of Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan. The service includes joint replacements, hip and knee revisions, arthroscopies, and orthopaedic related injections. This year the hospital has undertaken 1,700 orthopaedic procedures from the start of January to end November. The service currently provides for approximately 440 joint procedures per annum.  </p>  <p>  Any decisions in relation to increased funding for the delivery of additional orthopaedic services will be taken in the context of the extent of revenue funding available and will  be determined as part of the 2016 Service Plan and operational plan processes currently underway. Hospitals have authority to implement efficiencies and service improvements which can facilitate the provision of increased services within existing funding levels.</p></reply>

CUH also provides extensive interventional cardiology services and a 24/7 Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory providing 24/7 PPCI.  In late 2010, following investment of &euro;85m, the Cardiac Renal Centre was opened at CUH. The development which spans some 13,000m<sup>2</sup>over 6 floors, represented a very significant service development in the region.  </p><p>At this stage I am not in a position to commit to funding a specialised Heart Failure Unit at the hospital. The priority to be afforded to the development of such a dedicated service must, in the first instance, be considered by the HSE, in the context of the development of the Strategic Plan for the South South West Hospital Group.</p></reply>

This exercise involved very intensive work on the part of the HSE Mental Health Division, including the introduction of a new Standard Operating Procedure for both in-patient and community CAMHS services.  These measures must be seen in the context of ensuring the maximum benefit from the very substantial additional investment in CAMHS services under this Government.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE has been working to enable young people to access more readily counselling services in the primary care setting.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that very good progress has been made in addressing the waiting lists under these initiatives. The Waiting List is continuing to fall throughout 2015 as a result of this approach and, as of October 2015, the number of children waiting over 52 weeks has fallen by 50%.  In the meantime, children with counselling needs of a more serious nature continue to be referred to CAMHS, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to work to strengthen Primary Care counselling services by addressing the following key priorities:</p>  <p>  -  The filling of vacant Primary Care psychologist posts in targeted areas and the recruitment of Assistant Psychologists;</p>  <p>  -  The adoption of a stepped care model of counselling provision in child and adolescent primary care psychology services; and</p>  <p>  -  The implementation of the Access to Psychological Services Ireland (APSI) model in an incremental manner for children whereby children will be seen immediately and either offered a low intensity intervention or referred to a more appropriate service (e.g. secondary care mental health services).</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE will examine the feasibility of introducing a Counselling in Primary Care type model for children and adolescents.</p></reply>

This very valuable service ensures that seriously ill or injured people in more remote areas, have timely access to appropriate high quality clinical care. The service is targeted mainly at western counties, where the road network may not allow for timely transport to hospital.  Helicopter-based transport for those patients allows for greatly reduced transit times, particularly for time-critical transfers, such as STEMI heart attacks, stroke or major trauma.  Indeed, approximately one third of the missions to date have been in response to STEMI heart attacks, allowing patients to be treated in a specialist setting within 90 minutes of diagnosis.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Defence, to set out the scope of support to be provided by the Air Corps.  It is intended to keep the operation under review, to ensure a sustainable, long term service arrangement.</p></reply>

The new guidance does not, however, affect existing holders of the allowance.</p>  <p>  The HSE, Department of Health and Irish Medical Organisation are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the GMS and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs.

Wexford has been underpinned by an overall budget allocation for Waterford/Wexford Mental Health services, which was increased by over &euro;2m in 2015, from an allocation of just over &euro;39m in 2014 to slightly over &euro;41m for this year. The Waterford/Wexford region has received a total of 61 new development posts for mental health since 2012.  Many of these posts have been filled, or are at various stages of recruitment. However, there are a number of recruitment challenges in filling some posts, for reasons outlined in my recent reply, including issues around the recruitment of nurses and consultants.</p>  <p>  Difficulties in relation to the recruitment of mental health staff, wherever they occur nationally, do not relate primarily to lack of funding.  In this context, the HSE reiterate that the number of staff in this service can fluctuate due to various reasons such as retirement or staff moving to take up employment elsewhere. The Executive has sought to address underlying recruitment issues largely relating to Nursing and Medical staff. It promotes an integrated approach to service delivery across the catchment area, with access barriers removed, and is committed to a quality and safe mental health service in all respects. The position should also be facilitated by the easing of the national moratorium on recruitment,and through targeted campaigns by the Executive. </p>  <p>  Bearing in mind all the circumstances, including the Government's additional budgetary allocation for mental health in 2016, I am satisfied that HSE remains committed to providing the best possible mental health care in County Wexford.</p></reply>

However where an involuntary patient is 'unable' or 'unwilling' to give consent, the programme may be administered if it has been approved by the Consultant Psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the patient and also authorised by another Consultant Psychiatrist.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission recently published 'The Administration of Electro-convulsive Therapy in Approved Centres Activity Report 2013'. The Commission noted that in 85.5 per cent of cases, ECT was administered with the consent of the person. The Commission also noted that there was an increase in the number of treatments that were administered without consent. However when the figures are examined further there was only one single case where both Consultant Psychiatrists agreed that ECT should be administered on the basis of the 'unwilling' criterion and the overwhelming majority were in the 'unable' to consent category.  The Mental Health Commission publishes rules regarding the administration of ECT  to involuntary patients and adherence to these rules is monitored on an annual basis by the Inspector of Mental Health Services.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that ECT is an individual -specific treatment prescribed by the treating consultant based on the assessment of the patient concerned. Within the profession, it is acknowledged that there exists a cohort of people with severe treatment-resistant depression for whom ECT appears to be the only treatment that offers any real possibility of improvement. This is also supported by NICE Guidelines in the UK and the World Health Organisation. It is also noted from the recent Mental Health Commission report that in over 90% of cases, the Consultant Psychiatrist reported that treatment of ECT resulted in the improvement of the health of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  I fully agree that where a person with capacity refuses ECT, this should be respected. To this end, I have prioritised a change to the existing legislation to remove the 'unwilling' criterion from Section 59 of the Mental Health Act 2001. I will shortly bring legislation before the House to bring about this priority amendment.  I have recently written to the Deputy with my proposals on amending the legislation and I appreciate the support  that the Deputy has indicated he will give to this short Bill. Subject to obtaining and securing adequate D&aacute;il time, I hope to make this amendment before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Health related therapy supports and interventions for children, such as speech and language therapy, can be accessed through both the HSE&rsquo;s primary care services and its disability services, depending on the level of need.  Significant additional resources have been invested in recent years in the State&rsquo;s primary care and disability services with a view to enhancing therapy service provision. </p><p>Additional funding of &euro;20m was allocated in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts, including over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams.  In addition, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives specifically in relation to speech and language therapy services that are aimed at improving access to these services, such as therapists increasing clinic based work and providing family centred interventions in a group, as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.</p><p>The HSE is also currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)<i>.</i>The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  An additional &euro;4 million was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Progressing Disability Services Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year) has been provided this year to support its ongoing implementation. </p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Within this context, funding of &euro;8 million is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy through primary care services and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.

The objective of the ongoing health reform programme is to maximise the amount of care delivered locally while ensuring that specialist and complex care is safely provided in larger specialist centres.  Under the reform programme, Community Health Care Organisations have been established to improve the way in which primary care in the community is delivered.  Likewise the re-organisation of public hospitals into hospital groups is designed to deliver improved outcomes for patients.  Each group of hospitals will work together to provide acute care for patients in their areas, integrating with community and primary care.  The reform programme will be further progressed in 2016 with, for example, plans for General Practitioner direct access to ultrasound and x-ray services as well as the provision of minor surgery by GPs. </p>  <p>  I am, however, aware of the particular challenges in the delivery of health services in Donegal.  In fact, I visited Donegal in October this year to see at first hand the redevelopment that has been undertaken at Letterkenny General Hospital and to assess the health facilities on Arranmore Island and see how island residents deal with health issues.  Health services in the area continue to improve and there have been some notable developments in 2015 over and above the improvements to Letterkenny General Hospital, including the opening of a new Community Mental Health base in Donegal town in March and a new Health Campus and Primary Care Centre in Ballyshannon in September.  I understand that the HSE is also advancing a number of initiatives to address particular issues including the development of a new community hospital/nursing unit in Letterkenny, strengthening services for older persons at home and the provision of additional resources for mental health services.</p></reply>

It is also imperative that services meet patient needs, that existing GP services are maintained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs.</p>  <p>  Under the current General Medical Services contract, GPs who practise in remote rural areas of low population qualify for special rural practice concessions, including an annual Rural Practice Allowance of just over &euro;16,200, practice support subsidies towards the employment of certain practice staff at the maximum applicable rate regardless of the size of their patient panel, and the maximum applicable contribution towards locum costs for periods of leave.</p>  <p>  Where a GP currently holds the allowance but the circumstances underpinning this have changed, the GP retains the allowance while they continue to practise in that location.  When a new GP commences in the area, their application for the allowance is considered afresh by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently reviewed its guidelines for dealing with applications for a Rural Practice Allowance.

Significant progress has been made to date on the ED Taskforce.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;117m has been provided in 2015 to relieve pressures on acute hospitals including reducing delayed discharges, lowering the waiting time for Fair Deal funding and providing additional transitional care beds and home care packages.  Funding has been made available to support the acute hospital system over the winter period by providing additional bed capacity and other initiatives to support access to care.  This includes additional funding for Beaumont Hospital to enable St. Josephs Raheny Day Hospital to provide 5 day service to prevent ED presentation and admission of elderly patients. </p>  <p>  Six of the beds at Beaumont which had been closed for refurbishment or infection control purposes during 2015 have re-opened and a further 21 beds are to re-open in December.  Beaumont Hospital is one of the sites that have been the subject of particular focus with the SDU in supporting them to implement solutions. Delayed discharge numbers at the hospital have reduced from 95 on 25 November 2014 to 70 on 24 November 2015, thus freeing up 25 beds every day for acutely ill patients.</p>  <p>  All hospitals, including Beaumont. have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  I co-signed the ED Congestion Escalation Directive recently to ensure that progress made to date on overcrowding is sustained and deepened.  The Directive requires hospitals to implement their Escalation Plan whenever the Emergency Department experiences overcrowding and it is expected that this will add to the progress made on overcrowding so far.</p></reply>

This includes a commitment to supporting the organisation to re-configure the current model of service and funding arrangements to a more sustainable model while still maintaining the particular ethos of the service. </p>  <p>  I understand that as part of this process of engagement, the HSE requested Camphill to consider how its model of service provision may change over the coming years as Disability Services are reformed.  The HSE will work closely with Camphill to shape a five year plan to secure the additional resources required to ensure the future of the organisation in a sustainable way. </p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding to L'Arche Community for the provision of health and personal social services under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the financial challenges facing L&rsquo;Arche Community at this time and that the HSE has been in ongoing contact with the management of L&rsquo;Arche in an effort to find a solution to these difficulties. </p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that these difficulties stem from compliance issues with the regulatory environment, which require that the model of service previously provided by L&rsquo;Arche be reviewed and enhanced.

These efforts will continue in 2016 and preparation of the HSE&rsquo;s Service and Operational Plans will be underpinned by a focus on making the best use of the resource invested in disability services.</p>  <p>  I have been assured by the HSE that it will continue to work with Camphill and  L&rsquo;Arche Organisation and be as supportive as possible within current financial constraints.</p></reply>

If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated the safety of service users is of paramount importance and steps need to be taken to anticipate and avoid things going wrong and to reduce the impact if they do.  All employees including medical staff are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy.  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer.  Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare. This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.</p>  <p>  I recently announced that the Government has given its approval to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents.  This will be included in the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s draft Bill on Periodic Payment Orders which is well advanced.  The legislation is part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events. </p>  <p>  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential.  The intent of this legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure, which is undertaken in good faith and in compliance with national standards. This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs.  The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure.  </p>  <p>  Open disclosure is now HSE policy and therefore any unjustified breach of the policy (as with any HSE policy) will be managed in line with the HSE disciplinary procedures.  Where potential deviations have been identified the Healthcare records must be reviewed to ascertain any documentation in relation to communication with the patient about the adverse event and to establish if any rationale for non-disclosure has been documented.  Where there is no evidence that open disclosure has occurred the incident must be reviewed with the staff involved in the event.  The patient must be informed of the event and the impact of the event explained and acknowledged.  The patient should also be informed of the initial failure to disclose and an appropriate acknowledgement, explanation and apology provided. </p>  <p>  From a patient safety perspective the key focus of open disclosure is on learning so that systems and processes can be improved in order to reduce potential future harms to patients.  If a person is not satisfied that a health professional or administrator has fulfilled their obligations regarding open disclosure then that person has recourse to the HSE's complaints procedures. It is also open to a person to raise a complaint with the appropriate professional regulatory body or with the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

It was estimated that 350 women would apply to the Scheme, but in fact 578 applications have been accepted by the Scheme and as at 20 November 2015, 332 offers have been made.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has brought to an end years of uncertainty and costs for women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomy.  The Scheme was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment.  It was set up to give women who do not wish to pursue their cases through the courts an alternative option in which payments are made to women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy, whether or not negligence is proven.  The Scheme is voluntary and women did not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. </p>  <p>   In the interest of accountability, the Scheme requires each Applicant to prove that she had a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in order to be considered for the assessment of an award.  The level of proof required is clearly set out in the terms of the Scheme.  As the Scheme is designed to be simple, straight forward and non-adversarial, the women are not expected to give oral testimonies as they might do in a court setting.  I understand, however, that Judge Clark, Assessor for the Scheme has met with women in different parts of the country, where she considered it necessary, particularly in cases where women had been unable to locate hospital records </p>  <p>  I believe that Judge Clark operates the Scheme in a person-centred manner within its terms and in accordance with the principles of justice and fairness. </p>  <p>  The Government has given careful and detailed consideration to this complex and sensitive matter.  It believes that the implementation of the Scheme, together with the ongoing provision of medical services by the HSE, including medical cards, represents a comprehensive response to this issue, which should help bring resolution for the women, many of whom are elderly, and their families.</p></reply>

In Wexford, Mental Health Services are arranged by geographic location. There are General Adult Mental Health Teams based in Summerhill, Wexford (7-day service), Maryville, New Ross (5-day service), Carn House, Enniscorthy (7-day service) and Tara House, Gorey (7-day service).  </p><p>In addition, there is a Psychiatry of Old Age Team providing services for people aged 65 years and over. Also, the Rehabilitation Team works with internal referrals from the General Adult Teams for people with chronic and enduring mental health issues.</p><p>There are four day hospitals in County Wexford; three of which are open seven days per week (9am to 5pm). If someone is feeling suicidal, and wish to have a consultation, they can be referred through their General Practitioner to any of the four day hospitals and be seen by a Consultant Psychiatrist.  General Practitioners are familiar with the process for making such referrals.  If someone presents to the Emergency Department in Wexford General Hospital, who has not been referred through their General Practitioner, and is found to require a psychiatric assessment, then they are seen by a nurse-led liaison service (9am to 5pm Monday to Sunday) which will assess and triage, as appropriate. If the person is deemed to require admission for further assessment, diagnosis or treatment for a mental health illness, the liaison nurse makes contact with the Consultant on-call to make a referral and the person would be admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in University Hospital Waterford. If someone self-presents at the Emergency Department in Wexford General Hospital, and also requires medical attention, they would treated for their physical condition in the first instance. People who self-refer to the Emergency Department, Wexford General Hospital between 5pm to 9am, and who may require psychiatric assessment, will first be triaged by staff in that Emergency Department. </p><p>In line with the significant ring-fenced resources provided by this Government to prioritise and enhance mental health nationally, services in Wexford are being developed on an evolving basis, including the recruitment of additional appropriate staff to improve care provision. This has been underpinned, for example, by an overall budget allocation for Waterford/Wexford Mental Health services which increased by over &euro;2m in 2015, from an allocation of just over &euro;39m in 2014 to slightly over &euro;41m this year. The Waterford/Wexford  area received a total of 61 new development posts for mental health since 2012. I will ensure that, in common with other areas of the country, the mental health service in this  geographic area will improve over 2016, as part of  an overall package of new initiatives planned by the Government over the course of next year. </p></reply>

With a recovering economy, the Health Service Executive is now in a position to offer a wide range of career opportunities for nurses and midwives. Recruitment of additional nurses and consultants is the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals. Recruitment campaigns are underway in Ireland and abroad. </p>  <p>  The HSE Census returns for the end of October 2015 show that we have over 750 more nurses employed in the public health services than a year ago - 35,163 whole time equivalent's compared with 34,404 in October 2014. In July the HSE launched an International Staff Nurse/Midwife Recruitment Campaign which focused on the UK to attract staff nurses and midwives to jobs in Ireland. The current relocation package is up to &euro;1500 in vouched removal/relocation expenses including the cost of flights. At present there is no closing date for this campaign, as the HSE welcomes applications from nurses and midwives who are interested in joining the HSE from abroad on an ongoing basis. The HSE is making arrangements to specifically extend the campaign to locations for certain specialties that are further afield and in this context has sought sanction for an improved relocation package given the additional travel costs that would be involved. </p>  <p>  The number of consultants has also grown significantly in recent years to over 2,700. This includes 700 more consultants in the last decade and 320 in the last five years, in spite of the economic crisis, and the Government is committed to further growth. The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly in recent years, by over a 1,000 since March 2011, and now exceeds 5,500. This increase will help to address service needs and progress EWTD compliance, thereby improving the working conditions of doctors.</p>  <p>  The ability of the HSE and the health service to attract and retain high quality frontline staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required. The MacCraith Group was established  to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures. The Group made a series of recommendations in its three reports aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and importantly, planning for future service needs. The implementation of the Group's recommendations is being actively pursued and monitored. It is noted in particular that, on foot of the Group's recommendation on new entrant consultants pay,  improved rates for new entrant consultants, incorporating incremental credit for relevant experience and qualifications, have been agreed and are being implemented.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-03a.129.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120300032#WRC02500"><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland. There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction. The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p><p>Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.The introduction of new vaccines is based on the expert advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  Decisions on the supply of vaccines into the market are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day.  </p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recently completed a review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  </p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  </p><p>As of the 27 November, the HPRA has received 936 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  Of the 936 reports received, 933 were associated with use of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and three were associated with Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>.  The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  Parents of any child with a suspected adverse reaction following administration of a vaccine are advised to contact the HSE vaccination teams or their general practitioner for advice and are referred for further management if required.</p><p>All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet. The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age. </p><p>Prior to all school immunisation parents receive an information pack in a sealed package which contains an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter.  Information packs for all immunisation are standardised nationally.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. </p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website () where further information is available.  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.</p><p>The EMA has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.</p></reply>

The focus is on additional resources and capacity.</p>  <p>  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people.  Additional funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.  Capital funding has also been provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further. </p>  <p>  In the interim, patients from Crumlin are being transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK. These measures in total have more than doubled capacity for this surgery for patients on the Crumlin waiting list in 2015.  </p>  <p>  Two consultant orthopaedic surgeons have also been appointed recently at Galway University Hospital to support the spinal service there.  In the short term, Galway is actively working to assign dedicated beds to support this service and exploring the potential to refer some patients out for surgery.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to work with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, Saolta Hospital Group and the individual hospitals to identify all options to increase capacity further to improve access times for surgery.</p></reply>

In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of physical therapist and physiotherapist are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies.   </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations regarding my proposal to protect the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist and invited them to submit their views.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate have a number of clinical programmes that are working in the area of brain injury, including neurology, epilepsy, stroke and rehabilitation medicine. The clinical programmes are focusing on reducing waiting times/lists, addressing disease specific pathways and models of care with a view to developing a national framework for the management of long-term neurological conditions. The HSE also provide services for those with acquired brain injury through Primary Care Teams with community based therapy services and personal social services, often funded through partner agencies in the non-statutory sector.  </p>  <p>  A Steering Group led by the HSE Social Care Division, with representation from the National Clinical Programmes for Rehabilitation Medicine and Neurology, Department of Health, Primary Care, Therapy Professions and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland has been assigned the task of developing an implementation framework for the National Policy &amp;amp; Strategy for Neuro-Rehabilitation Services.  Once the implementation framework has been agreed by the Steering Group, it will then go for consultation to the wider stakeholder interest groups.  Following consultation, the framework will be revised and will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level.</p>  <p>  In August 2015, my colleague, the Minister for Health, announced an additional &euro;15 million for the redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) in Dun Laoghaire.

Many of these cases however, particularly those involving catastrophic injuries, are very complex in nature and require time to investigate the liability and causation issues.

It is also imperative that services meet patient needs, that existing GP services are maintained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs.</p>  <p>  Under the current General Medical Services contract, GPs who practise in remote rural areas of low population qualify for special rural practice concessions, including an annual Rural Practice Allowance of just over &euro;16,200, practice support subsidies towards the employment of certain practice staff at the maximum applicable rate regardless of the size of their patient panel, and the maximum applicable contribution towards locum costs for periods of leave.</p>  <p>  Where a GP currently holds the allowance but the circumstances underpinning this have changed, the GP retains the allowance while they continue to practise in that location.  When a new GP commences in the area, their application for the allowance is considered afresh by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently reviewed its guidelines for dealing with applications for a Rural Practice Allowance.  The purpose of the new guidance is to ensure consistency, transparency and fairness in decision-making in respect of the relevant discretionary provisions of the GMS contract pertaining to the granting or otherwise of the allowance to new applicants.  The new guidance does not affect existing holders of the allowance.</p>  <p>  The HSE, Department of Health and Irish Medical Organisation are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the GMS and other publicly-funded health sector contracts involving GPs.

I convened the Emergency Department (ED) Taskforce last year and the resulting ED Taskforce Action Plan published in April contains a range of time defined actions that are being implemented to alleviate overcrowding in EDs. </p><p>Recruitment of additional nurses and consultants is also a priority for the HSE.

As part of the recruitment campaign the HSE is offering 2015 graduates permanent posts. The Nursing Degree Programme is designed to provide a sufficient number of graduating nurses each year, 1,570, to meet future needs.</p><p>With regard to workforce planning, Action 46 of Future Health (DoH, 2012) provides for the Department to work with the HSE to implement an effective approach to workforce planning and development with the objectives of: recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff; training and upskilling the workforce; providing for professional and career development; and creating supportive and healthy workplaces. My Department has also committed to developing a National Integrated Strategic Framework for health workforce planning, in collaboration with other Government Departments and agencies. The main objectives of this framework will be the recruitment and retention of the right mix of staff, provision of career and professional development opportunities and the creation of supportive and healthy workplaces.  A cross-sectoral working group is in the process of being established and will begin its work early next year.  It is expected that an implementation plan will be delivered before the end of 2016.</p></reply>

Other people with disabilities can be assessed and apply for assistance towards the provision of a recommended piece of equipment. Assessments are carried out by a range of multidisciplinary staff; for example, assessments for mobility aids would generally be carried out by an occupational therapist and/or a physiotherapist.</p>  <p>  Provision of any equipment is based on detailed information received and with the assistance of prioritisation guidelines to ensure that people with the most urgent assessed needs have their needs met first, within a set monthly budget. All professionals providing community-based services, including occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and public health nurses, will be aware of the prioritisation criteria and will provide any necessary and urgent items of equipment following appropriate assessment as soon as possible. However, the Health Service as a whole has to operate within the parameters of funding available to it, and this is a major challenge for all stakeholders, including the HSE, voluntary service providers, services users and their families.</p>  <p>  In relation to mobility equipment, occupational therapists carry out assessments and review applications in light of the individual&rsquo;s current and ongoing needs, with the priority being to provide functional mobility for indoor and short-distance outdoor use. Therefore the equipment recommended by the clinician will be appropriate to the needs of the individual. The provision of wheelchairs is not a demand-led service, and requests are prioritised according to need and according to resources. A client is prioritised according to clinical need. If the referral is for essential equipment, then it is deemed a P1 (high priority). If resources are available, equipment is sanctioned based on highest assessed prioritisation. Wheelchairs are issued based on client need and functional abilities rather than any specific waiting time.</p>  <p>  The HSE has no plans at present to develop a register of wheelchair users. However, the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database (NPSDD), established in 2002, holds information to assist the Department of Health and the HSE in providing appropriate services designed to meet the changing needs of people with a physical or sensory disability. The NPSDD contains over 24,000 records of individuals using or requiring physical or sensory disability services. Information is collected on a voluntary basis and records the number of assisted mobility aids, including wheelchairs, used by people who are registered on the database.</p></reply>

Last December I convened the ED Taskforce to assist in dealing with the challenges presented by ED overcrowding. Significant progress has been made to date on the ED Taskforce implementation. Additional funding of &euro;117 million has been provided in 2015 to relieve pressures on acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the 2015/16 winter period, hospital groups have provided comprehensive winter resilience plans to the HSE.  This approach is intended both to avoid unnecessary admissions to acute hospitals and to expedite discharges from hospital efficiently. Following discussions between the Director General of the HSE and myself on how best to address ED congestion with all of the available resources, a National Directive has been issued under the terms of the Accountability Framework which sets out the mandatory minimum response required. The purpose of the Directive is to ensure that ED congestion is recognised as a key issue for the whole hospital, primary and community care services and that the response to such congestion is consistent across all acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  In relation to the number of persons on trolleys at St Luke's Hospital Kilkenny, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Initially, the HSE established 530 PCTs nationally based on an extensive mapping exercise involving a whole population approach. Since then, various exercises were carried out in relation to re-mapping, efficiency evaluation, resource reallocation and engagement with stakeholders, resulting in the number of PCTs being reduced to 485. Almost 600 additional staff were recruited and assigned to the PCTs. There are currently over 3,000 staff members reconfigured across the 485 PCTs.</p>  <p>  A range of services for children are delivered by the PCT members in a coordinated way and in keeping with relevant policies and government priorities.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Primary Care Strategy, PCTs have been designed and planned on a whole population basis.

While certain flexibilities had been built into the ECCE Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was conscious for some time of the difficulty experienced by some children with a disability in accessing and benefitting fully from this Programme. With this in mind, he requested that an Inter-Departmental Group, led by his Department, be established with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue. Representatives of my Department and the Health Service Executive participated on this Group.</p>  <p>  The Group has concluded its work and its recommendations have been fully accepted by Government. As part of Budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of supports for children with a disability with costs for these supports estimated to be &euro;15 million in 2016 and full year costs estimated to be &euro;33 million from 2017 onwards.</p>  <p>  The model of supports was launched on 18 November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister for Education and Skills. I believe that this Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability and the allocation of funding is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to supporting such children. The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.</p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8 million is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand, inter alia, the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme. It is anticipated that the development of early intervention services in particular, as part of the roll-out of the new inclusive pre-school supports model, will help children with a disability to access mainstream pre-school settings.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the HSE has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to participate in the ECCE Programme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.</p>  <p>  My Department has asked the HSE for a report on the specific matter raised by the Deputy pertaining to pre-school children in County Meath.  I will be in further communication with the Deputy in due course.</p></reply>

The registered land in each county is divided into folios, one for each individual ownership or title.  The Register provides conclusive evidence of title to property and any right, privilege, appurtenance or burden appearing thereon. The PRA further states that the title shown on the folio is guaranteed by the State which is bound to indemnify any person who suffers loss through a mistake made by the Land Registry.</p><p>I would encourage the Deputy to access this service to secure ownership information for the properties in question.</p><p>The relevant local authority for the area in question may also be in a position to provide further information to the extent any of these properties may constitute an unfinished estate.</p></reply>

Agreed in 2014 and with an entry into application date of 3 January 2017, MiFID 2 will:</p>  <p>- Reduce the level of exemptions available, in comparison to MiFID 1, thus meaning that more financial products will be defined as derivative financial instruments and will therefore fall within the scope of MiFID II and other financial legislation such as Market Abuse.</p>  <p>- The number of exemptions available to entities trading commodity derivatives has been reduced which means meaning that certain entities controlling futures trading will require authorisation once MIFID 2 is fully implemented and hence will be subject to supervision by National Competent Authorities.</p>  <p>- MiFID 2 also contains important provisions relating to position management, position limits and product intervention. These provisions are in respect of all financial instruments, including commodity derivatives, and have the purpose of providing regulators with tools to avoid excessive speculation in financial instruments, including commodity derivatives.</p>  <p>  Commodity futures are required to be cleared which improves the stability of commodity futures markets. Separately, under the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EU 648/2012), the Central Bank has available to it data on transactions and positions of non-financial as well as financial counterparties engaged in commodities future markets, data which is held in various trade repositories.</p>  <p>  The MiFID II proposals complement initiatives taken in other financial services files such as Market Abuse Regulation and Benchmarks, and together they are are expected to result in a more robust regime for all commodity derivative markets, including food securities, whether traded OTC or through exchanges. This new legislative environment will be much more prescriptive than the current arrangements and will serve to prevent market abuse and to support orderly pricing in commodity derivatives and related commodity markets.</p></reply>

Following on from that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies.</p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner. This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that the required processes and procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.</p>  <p>  I have met with the three credit union representative bodies and the perceived impact of the new regulations was discussed. It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations by the Registrar of Credit Unions. Following commencement the Commencement Order will be published in Iris Oifigiuil. These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

Activate also offers the advantages of deliverability and speed of execution.  The Activate model is capable of substantially quicker credit turnaround times than average time frames currently in the market place given the requirement, typically, for project promoters to deal with more than one lender, and sometimes multiple lenders.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that Activate will, in this way, be capable of financing the construction of over 11,000 new homes in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Whilst Activate is only in operation since the beginning of September, and therefore to date no capital has been drawn down, it has an active pipeline of projects and has been well received by the market. Activate is currently in discussions with a number of project promoters on potential opportunities.</p></reply>

These include establishing operational capability with funders and lending partners, building internal systems and business processes and establishing a team to safely and effectively manage the funding provided on behalf of the State.</p>  <p>  The Government's aim for the SBCI is to enhance the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland.  The SBCI is achieving this by working with existing and new providers to develop specific funding products and by supporting new entrants to the SME lending market through allocating funding to a number of non-bank SME finance providers.  The SBCI is also pursuing its objective of driving competition within the SME funding market through the provision of funding to a broad range of potential lending partners.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the SBCI commenced lending on the 9 March 2015 through both Bank of Ireland and AIB. In addition to these two original lending partners the SBCI has recently signed on lending agreements with two non-bank lenders, Finance Ireland and Merrion Fleet Management.</p>  <p>  Up to 30 September 2015, some &euro;110m in SME loans were approved and drawn down by c.3200 SMEs.  The loans have been taken up by Irish SMEs for a variety of purposes and across a range of sectors in the economy. The SBCI has continued to see a strong take up of its loans with the pace of drawdown in the six months sustained since then.</p>  <p>  At present, the SBCI is actively engaged with other potential lending partners in regards to their operational capability with the ambition to become SBCI lending partners during 2015 thereby providing Irish SMEs with greater choice in securing the most appropriate funding for their business needs.  The SBCI is also actively developing and marketing its brand and awareness of its products with SMEs and their representative organisations and advisers.</p></reply>

The Central Bank had briefed industry representatives in August that it was proposing significant increases in those levies in 2015. The proposed increases were driven by a proliferation of legislative regulation and corresponding regulatory activity; a need to meet a shortfall from 2014's levies; and an increase in staff pension costs arising from Financial Reporting Standard 17 (which was coupled with prevailing low yields on the bond market).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's original proposals have since been revised to partially mitigate those increases as per a statement of 30 September 2015 published on the Central Bank's website. The revised proposals significantly reduced the increase in pension costs charged to the regulated sector in 2015 which is instead spread over coming years thereby easing the burden on financial services sector firms this year.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a robust regulatory environment benefits the financial services industry by promoting stability, a level playing field and facilitating prudent development and innovation. A well regulated financial services sector also benefits consumers, industry, and the economy at large. In order to ensure a well regulated financial services sector the Central Bank must be sufficiently resourced, particularly in terms of staff who are key to an effective regulatory regime. Pensions are a standard component in financial regulation costs given their link to staff costs.</p>  <p>  Under Section 32D of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank is required to seek my approval for the Regulations prescribing industry levies. As part of that process officials from my Department met with intermediary industry representatives in order to hear their concerns on the increase in levies payable by their members. Following the publication of the Central Bank's revised proposals, which significantly reduced the pension element of the 2015 levies, I approved the Regulations prescribing the 2015 levies on 7 October last.</p></reply>

Returns for each year are due by 15 January of the following year, and the total value of DIRT due and paid is reported to the Revenue Commissioners on the January returns at institutional level. Detailed figures are not required in these returns to provide the information the Deputy has sought, specifically to identify the number of deposit-savings accounts yielding less than &euro;200 in DIRT, the average payment of DIRT per eligible account or the total number of interest paying accounts on which DIRT was paid.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may be interested to note that, separately, under regulations as provided for in Section 891B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, certain financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, are required to make automatic annual returns at account level electronically to Revenue. The primary purpose of this Section is to provide information for use in risk analysis by Revenue and therefore the requirement to report interest focuses on account holders in receipt of larger payments. The information under S891B is provided where the payment of interest is greater than &euro;635 in a year and in all instances of a first interest payment on newly opened accounts irrespective of amount. These returns include DIRT exempt accounts.  Returns for 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 were due by the end of March 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively. It is important to note the information received under Section 891B is not limited to individuals but also includes interest payments on accounts held by corporations and other entities. It should also be noted that the reporting threshold was reduced from &euro;635 to &euro;300 from 2014 onwards.</p>  <p>  The number of interest bearing deposit accounts reported under the S891B regulations for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 is 1.43 million, 1.23 million, 1.21 million and 1.32 million respectively. The total value of interest paid to these accounts for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 is &euro;2.42 billion, &euro;2.11 billion, &euro;1.97 billion and &euro;1.38 billion respectively. Financial institutions reported that DIRT was not deducted on around 193,000, 197,300, 201,400 and 163,300 of these accounts for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively but data on the amount of DIRT forgone in respect of such accounts are not available. These figures are provisional and may be subject to revision.</p></reply>

VAT on these services is now chargeable where the consumer is located instead of where the supplier is located. This ensures that the VAT goes to the Member State in which the services are used. The estimated resulting increase in receipts was &euro;100 million and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that these projections were very accurate.</p>  <p>  However, there is an additional source of revenue that we were unable to estimate at the time. As a result of the change, businesses are required to register and account for VAT in every Member State in which they supply such services to consumers or, alternatively, to avail of the optional special scheme known as the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS). The MOSS scheme is a simplification scheme which allows a business engaged in those supplies to register in a single Member State, to file a single quarterly return and pay its VAT liability for all Member States through a web portal in the Member State of registration. The return details and payments are transferred by the Member State of registration to the relevant Member States of consumption with the Member State of registration retaining a percentage of the VAT collected. The percentage retained is 30% during 2015/6 and 15% during 2017/8. </p>  <p>  I am advised that, following Quarter 3, the total VAT received from other Member States through the MOSS scheme in relation to supplies to consumers in Ireland for 2015 along with VAT retained by Revenue amounted to &euro;86 million, to date in 2015.</p></reply>

The Deputy should also be aware that an affected customer has the right to appeal to the Financial Service Ombudsman or to the Courts.</p>  <p>  The bank is continuing its work to ensure that all affected customer accounts receive appropriate redress.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, it is my understanding that as part of its Enforcement Investigation the Central Bank has the power to impose a regulatory sanction on the bank for its conduct in this matter but that is ultimately a matter for the Central Bank and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that.</p>  <p>  On 30 September 2015, PTSB announced that it had established a wider Mortgage Product Review Group ("MPRG" ) to identify any instances where the contractual terms and conditions attached to accounts are not being fully honoured by the bank and/or whether other material issues such as the provision of key information at relevant times requires further examination.  I have been informed by PTSB that the review group is now up and running.</p></reply>

The STOP <i>Food Waste </i>programme, which is funded under the EPA National Waste Prevention Programme, supports homes and businesses to prevent food waste. The programme website, <i>Stopfoodwaste.ie</i>, is a valuable component of the campaign and provides advice and tips to businesses and large organisations on reducing food waste.</p><p>As I indicated in Replies to Parliamentary Questions 21940/15, 29478/15 and 22054/15, I am aware of the success of voluntary initiatives by organisations such as BiaFood and FoodCloud which have worked with large retail outlets to offer edible food to charities in a safe, efficient and responsive way. Earlier this year I visited the BiaFoodInitiative regional hub in Little Island, Cork, the first of three planned hubs, which is offering an infrastructure to accept and redistribute large volumes of surplus food to an industry standard, as well as the latest in software technology to track and trace all product movements from point of entry to the end user, and a strong voluntary organisation model. BiaFoodInitiative have met <font color="#222222">Tesco, who are providing equipment and some other support. </font>The Department of Social Protection has supported staffing of the hub and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has provided advice on carrying out the business safely and in compliance with the food regulations, as such organisations come under the definition of a food business in the general food law. In March BiaFoodInitiative joined Bord Bia&rsquo;s online Origin Green Platform, which provides access to a network of over 400 companies, who could include this as a waste reduction measure in their Origin Green action plans.</p><p>FoodCloud connects businesses that have too much food with charities in communities that have too little. Using their app, or through their website, participating businesses can upload details of their surplus food and the time period in which the food can be collected. The first charity to accept the offer collects it directly from the business. By donating surplus food to various charities, businesses can assist charities to reduce their food costs and so allow them to redirect funding to programs to assist the disadvantaged, creating tangible and long lasting local benefits. Following a successful pilot programme, Tesco Ireland and FoodCloud last year announced a partnership that will see all surplus food from Tesco&rsquo;s 146 stores redistributed to charities and community groups through the use of FoodCloud&rsquo;s innovative app.  There is much to be said for promoting voluntary engagement by the industry with such initiatives before consideration by Government on whether legislation is appropriate.</p></reply>

As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement.  The SFPA and the Naval Service through the Fisheries Monitoring Centre has monitored the movements of these vessels when in our Exclusive Fisheries Zone, using the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), Automatic Identification System (AIS) and declared catches through Electronic Reporting System (ERS). I am advised that there are three freezer vessels currently in our EFZ.  This risk assessment had informed the SFPA&rsquo;s identification of some of those vessels as a high priority for at-sea inspection, and aircraft surveillance. The SFPA is reliant on the seagoing fishery patrol activity of the Naval Service to verify compliance of vessels not landing into Ireland.  The weather has been particularly severe in the recent past. Boarding vessels of this size at sea creates specific challenges and to date the operational decision of the Naval service has been that weather has been too severe to safely attempt a boarding operation.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the Naval Service has ships on patrol and are ready to conduct boarding operations on these vessels when weather conditions permit.</p>  <p>  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted. Council Regulation 1224/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis.  Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.  The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.</p></reply>

The Scheme has been used to assist forestry owners who have been affected by Ash dieback disease. The objective of the Scheme is to eradicate/contain ash dieback in forests by supporting the removal and destruction of trees and leaf litter and to reconstitute the forest by replanting with alternative species. The Scheme provides funding in respect of costs necessarily incurred in clearing the site and reconstituting the forest, subject to the maximum limits laid down.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is restricted to forestry and currently there are no plans to either broaden the scope of the Scheme or to introduce any other Scheme for individuals or nurseries that have been affected by outbreaks of plant diseases including ash dieback.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide funding for the development of the horticultural industry including commercial nurseries through the Horticultural Grant scheme. In the recent budget I allocated &euro;4.5 million for the Scheme in 2016 and the Scheme is currently open for applications until the 18 December of this year.</p></reply>

This definition applies to all Member States and my Department has no discretion with regard to its implementation in Ireland. The status of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; introduced under the reformed Common Agricultural Policy is designed specifically to assist young farmers in the initial stages of establishing a farming enterprise.</p>  <p>  The farmers in the group commonly referred to as &lsquo;forgotten farmers&rsquo; are under 40, established their holdings prior to 2008 and hold low value entitlements. These farmers will benefit from an increase in the value of the entitlements under the convergence process between 2015 and 2019, whereby farmers who hold entitlements with an Initial Unit Value below 90% of the Basic Payment Scheme national average will see the value of their entitlements increase gradually over the five years of the scheme.   </p>  <p>  With regard to qualification for the enhanced 60% rate of aid under TAMS, the definition of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; laid down for the purposes of any capital investment schemes is also that farmers must be below 40 years of age at the time of application and have been set up in farming within the previous five years. Unfortunately, this means that some farmers will not qualify for the enhanced rate of aid under TAMS. However, any young farmers who do not qualify for the enhanced rate of aid under the dedicated Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme will be prioritised for aid under the various other new TAMS schemes which offers grants of 40% of investment costs. The following schemes are open for application to all farmers irrespective of age: </p>  <p>- Dairy Equipment Scheme;</p>  <p>- Low emission Slurry Spreading;</p>  <p>- Organic capital investment Scheme;</p>  <p>- Animal welfare safety and nutrient storage Scheme;</p>  <p>- Pig and poultry investment Scheme.</p></reply>

This figure comprises 12,866 members, 978 reserve members, and 2,012 civilians as of 31 October. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective, visible policing throughout the country. The number of Garda&iacute; is crucial to this but, also of importance, is ensuring that the overall composition of the Garda workforce achieves the right balance between highly trained Garda&iacute; and professional, skilled civilian staff, and that the Service harnesses the energy and skills of volunteers through the Garda Reserve.</p>  <p>  The optimal number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a factor of a number of different considerations, including population size and composition, crime trends, the level of civilianisation, etc. Having said that, the Government is committed to on-going seamless recruitment into the future and as the Deputy will be aware, provision has been made in Budget 2016 for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. It is expected that a further 395 will attest by the end of 2016 which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  I expect recruitment to continue at or around the current levels for the next number of years having regard to factors such as the level of retirements in any one year.</p>  <p>  In relation to civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are employed in a wide range of management, administrative, technical and operational roles where they make an invaluable contribution to the delivery of effective policing services throughout the country. The increased budget allocation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016, in addition to providing for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute;, provides for the recruitment of additional civilian experts, in particular to develop the Garda ICT investment programme. Having regard to international experience, I believe that there is undoubtedly value in exploring the opportunities for increasing the ratio of civilians to Garda&iacute;, and for releasing Garda&iacute; from administrative and other positions to front-line duties. The process which is currently ongoing to civilianise border control functions at Dublin airport and the transfer of these responsibilities from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is an excellent example of this.  Further work in this area will be progressed in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner in the context of the report of the Garda Inspectorate of its review under the Haddington Road Agreement. The terms of reference of that review include all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the deployment of members and civilian staff to relevant and appropriate roles.</p>  <p>  In relation to the County Louth Division, I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; on the 31 October 2015, the latest dates for which figures are readily available, is 281 (including 10 newly attested Garda&iacute;) of which 104 are assigned to the Drogheda Garda District. There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 23 Civilians attached to that Division.  I have also been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the allocations of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored to ensure optimal use of Garda human resources.  This process is periodically reviewed in light of particular incidents of concern or challenges and it is in this context that the Commissioner has directed the allocation of an additional 27 Garda&iacute;, including two Sergeants, to the Louth Division as an interim measure.  These Garda&iacute; are being transferred on a temporary basis to support the work of the 283 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Louth Division. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that the work of local Garda&iacute; in the Louth Division is augmented by a number of Garda national units which are assisting with covert and overt operations targeting prolific criminals and dissidents who reside within and outside this jurisdiction. The Emergency Response Unit is actively deployed in the Division and is providing a presence in the vicinity of checkpoints which are being carried out by uniform personnel. Furthermore there is ongoing liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland under the auspices of an agreed Cross-Border Policing Strategy to continue the excellent levels of cooperation between both police services in addressing crime and terrorist activities in all its manifestations</p>  <p>  In addition to investing in renewing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units. So far this year the  Louth  Division has been allocated 12 new Garda cars as a result of this increased investment. The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.</p></reply>

An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  </p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation. </p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person concerned to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship. </p>  <p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department.  However, there are no plans to reduce or abolish these fees.</p></reply>

If they have not already done so, the person concerned should apply for renewal of their permission to remain. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. While most cases are now generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.

Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence. Entitlement of a child to Irish citizenship is determined by the Passport Office following receipt of an application for a passport on the child's behalf.</p>  <p>  Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have 5 years residence in the State. Alternatively, a parent who is a naturalised Irish citizen may lodge an application on behalf of the child under section 16 of the Act. It is important that individuals who require permission to remain in the State keep this permission up-to-date at all times.

In addition, new prisoner programmes have been introduced such as the Incentivised Regimes policy which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.</p></reply>

It is in this context that Tusla has decided to cease funding the organisation in question</p>  <p>  Tusla values the work of bereavement support groups and recognises the positive contribution they have made in supporting families and local communities.</p>  <p>  Tusla appreciates that this withdrawal of funding will create a challenge for bereavement support groups going forward and extends its thanks for the work undertaken by the group in question over the years.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, it was announced that, from September 2016, children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they turn age 3, and can continue in free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June). Until this date however, the current eligibility criteria and rules of the Programme will remain.</p>  <p>  Currently, children are entitled to one year free pre-school (i.e. 38 weeks during the academic year) under this Programme. As the first child mentioned by the Deputy  availed of this entitlement during the 2014/5 programme year, no additional provision can be made for him. In addition, the second child mentioned by the Deputy is below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016/17 programme year.</p>  <p>  This extension of free pre-school will increase the number of children benefiting from free pre-school from about 67,000 per annum, to 127,000 in a given programme year. Accommodating this increase requires a significant increase in capacity in the pre-school sector; pre-school services need time to consider and implement any needed infrastructural or service changes, and to put in place extra staff resources. The September 2016 implementation date was set to allow pre-school providers to put such measures in place.  </p>  <p>  It is appreciated that this does mean that a small cohort of children, including one of the children referred to by the Deputy, while continuing to avail of the 38 week entitlement to free pre-school currently provided under the ECCE programme, will not benefit from additional free pre-school provided under this new budgetary measure. However, should an earlier start date have been chosen, the likelihood is that there would not have been sufficient capacity in the sector to accommodate all children.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. </p>  <p>  An amount of &euro;488,200 has been allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland. My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.   </p>  <p>  Last week, I was pleased to allocate &euro;1.17m in &lsquo;once-off&rsquo; funding to assist youth projects that are experiencing budgetary difficulties as they approach the end of the year.  An allocation of &euro;10,000 was made to Leixlip Youth Project. The youth projects came to my Department's attention through engagement with the national youth organisations, youth officers in the Education and Training Boards, through representations and submissions received and through regular meetings with youth services in the course of the year.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2016 has provided an additional &euro;1.1m in current youth funding to my Department bringing the total allocation to &euro;51m to support the voluntary youth services in 2016. The additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.</p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;2.75m in capital funding has been allocated to my Department for 2016. In the main, this funding will be used to support smaller scale projects, such as refurbishments, health and safety works, and accessibility improvements in youth services.</p>  <p>  My Department has commenced work on the detailed allocations for the national youth organisations and local services and projects funded under the various schemes. Every effort is being made to notify youth organisations and projects of their 2016 allocation as soon as possible. Details of the new capital funding scheme will be announced early in the New Year.</p></reply>

On  foot of the Deputy's question, I arranged for enquiries to be made regarding the issues raised and have ascertained that they relate to a young adult, rather than a child.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, long-stay charges for in-patient services only apply to the further provision of in-patient services to adults who have already received at least 30 days of in-patient services during the immediately preceding 12-month period. Accordingly, many respite episodes would not attract any charge.  Those receiving ongoing acute care as well as those being supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme are excluded from these charges.</p>  <p>  The Regulations provide for two different classes of income-based charges in respect of the maintenance element of the in-patient services provided:</p>  <p>  - Class 1 relates to charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24-hour nursing care is provided, subject to a current maximum of &euro;175 per week for a person whose income is &euro;208 or more, and</p>  <p>  - Class 2 charges apply where 24-hour nursing care is not provided, subject to a current maximum of &euro;130 per week for a person whose income is &euro;194 or more. </p>  <p>  Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the charging provisions under the 2005 Act and Regulations:</p>  <p>  - Firstly, the Act caps the amount which may be charged &ndash; at 80% of the non-contributory State Pension weekly rate.  At present, that means an upper limit of &euro;175.20 per week.</p>  <p>  - Secondly, the charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a reasonable income for personal use: at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates.</p>  <p>  - Thirdly, the Act provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person if necessary to avoid undue financial hardship. </p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the 2005 Act and Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination of long-stay charges for in-patient services. These include the need to have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants. The guidelines ensure that the applicable charge is determined taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings while receiving care, including reasonable regular financial commitments. This avoids any unfair burden on the service user or his or her dependants.</p></reply>

An Outpatient Lead has been appointed to oversee the management of the waiting list, and improvements in waiting time performance are being achieved.  </p>  <p>  The Group achieved the maximum permissible waiting time of 18 months by 30 June 2015, and is on target to achieve the maximum permissible waiting time for an outpatient appointment of 15 months by year end. To this end, a series of measures are being put in place. Firstly, waiting lists have been validated to ensure accuracy. In addition, an exercise is underway to ensure that all appointment slots are being used appropriately, and contact is made with patients in advance of their appointment in an effort to minimise the number of people who do not attend.  </p>  <p>  Specialties have been identified where additional measures are required to achieve waiting time improvement. In specialties such as ENT and Orthopaedics, arrangements are in place to refer patients, as appropriate, to private facilities. Additional clinics have been put in place across the Group in certain specialties such as Ophthalmology, Orthopaedics and Neurology. A locum Consultant Neurologist has been employed for 2 weeks to facilitate additional clinics in that specialty.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the University of Limerick Hospitals Group is centralising the process for the management of all new outpatient referrals. Work to streamline the service and deliver on shorter patient wait times, is already well underway, and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016.</p></reply>

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service.  The amount payable in respect of certain of these supports is related to the doctor's panel size.  In addition, medical indemnity insurance premia are refunded to contracted GPs, also based on the size of each doctor's GMS patient panel.  The HSE pays into a superannuation scheme a sum equivalent to 10% of total capitation fees payable to contracted GPs.</p>  <p>  The most recently published Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments of the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service relates to the year 2013.  This report indicates that payments totalling &euro;451.7 million were made to some 2,400 GMS contract holders.  In total these costs related to approximately 1.9 million GMS patients.  There was substantial variation in the average amount paid, ranging from &euro;14,753 for a patient panel of up to 100 patients to &euro;448,960 for a panel of 2,001 or more patients.  The addition of substantially more contract-holding GPs would enhance the choice available to patients in the first place but any impact on the Exchequer would be dependent on the distribution of the eligible patients across the panels of contracting doctors.  Where newly-qualified GPs obtain a GMS contract, they can only attract patients from the existing pool of GMS patients until such time as further phases of universal GP care are introduced.</p></reply>

The title of physiotherapist will, as a consequence, be protected for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register's 2 year transitional period ends in 2018.  </p>  <p>  I am currently examining the issue of also protecting the title of physical therapist under the Act.  In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of physical therapist and physiotherapist are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies.   </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations regarding my proposal to protect the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist and invited them to submit their views.  The submissions are now being examined and I expect that I will make a decision on the matter before the end of the year that ensures public protection and appropriately addresses the legitimate concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

The objective of the Redress Board was to provide compensation to women who were former patients of Dr Michael Neary, who had unnecessary obstetric hysterectomies and also to women under 40 years of age who had unnecessary bilateral oophorectomies, i.e. the removal of both ovaries or a remaining single functioning ovary at the time of obstetric hysterectomy, or as a gynaecological procedure.  In each case the surgical procedure would have led to early menopause.  The Redress Board determined that awards were payable in 119 cases. </p>  <p>  Following on from this, the Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme was set up in November 2013 in keeping with a commitment in the Programme for Government to make awards to women over 40 who had a bilateral oophorectomy, or removal of a single functioning ovary, but whose applications were rejected on age grounds alone by the Redress Board.  To date 45 awards have been made with a small number of applications awaiting final determination.  Thirty seven applications were refused under this latter Scheme, because they did not meet the criteria for awards and another 9 applications were withdrawn. </p>  <p>  The criteria for eligibility under both Schemes were very clear and unfortunately the person who has requested consideration of her case did not meet the criteria for either Scheme.  The total gross cost of both Schemes to date is &euro;23.4m.  With contributions from indemnifiers of &euro;7.7m, the net cost to the Exchequer is therefore &euro;15.7m.   </p>  <p>  I met with Patient Focus during Summer 2015 concerning a small number of women who were represented by Patient Focus, who did not meet the criteria to receive awards under either of the schemes.  Following this meeting my officials carefully considered this matter.  Having looked at the cases in question, and the broad range of conditions detailed, despite being sympathetic to the plight of the women, I do not propose to seek approval from Government to establish a further Redress Scheme.  It is of course, open to any woman to seek redress or compensation in the normal way should her legal adviser determine she has a case.</p></reply>

A patient requiring unscheduled services outside of hours may access those services through a hospital emergency department. It is a statutory provision that a charge applies where out patient services are provided, under the Health (Out-Patient Charges) Regulations 2013, Statutory Instrument 45/2013.  The regulations set a charge of &euro;100 for the out-patient services.  The charge shall be payable by each person who avails of the services concerned, but the charge shall only be made in respect of the first occasion the service is provided in relation to each episode of care.  The out-patient charge will not apply should the visit result in the patient being admitted to the hospital as an in-patient.</p>  <p>  Subsection 3(3) of S.I. No. 45/2013 lists exemptions from the charge for out-patient services provided.  Subsection 3(3)(d) provides that the charge shall not be payable by "a child, referred to in section 56(3) of the Act, in respect of diseases and disabilities of a permanent or long term nature prescribed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform".  On the basis of the exemption in section 3(3)(d), the &euro;100 charge does not apply where out-patient services are made available in respect of a prescribed disease or disability to a person of less than 16 years of age. </p>  <p>  The conditions prescribed for the purposes of subsection 56(3) are set out in the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1987, Statutory Instrument 114/1987, as follows: "mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy."</p></reply>

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following a ruling of the High Court, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the Health Service executive as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  </p>  <p>  The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process, given the number and complexity of cases, and has taken a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, it should be noted that the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  </p>  <p>  Following the publication of a National Disability Authority report commissioned by the Department of Health and the HSE, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring children&rsquo;s disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities, including autism, and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to, or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  In 2014 an additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated to drive implementation of the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4m (equating to &euro;6m in a full year) has been allocated to the Programme this year to support its ongoing implementation.  </p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Funding is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.  Full implementation of the Programme is expected before the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information he has requested.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office who will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

There is an international nursing and medical manpower shortage, leading to difficulties in recruiting nurses, doctors and consultants.  This difficulty is being experienced by other English speaking countries including the UK, Australia, and Canada.  Added to this these countries compete for our graduates.</p>  <p>  Given the challenging economic position since 2008 and the need to reduce the public sector pay bill it is difficult to compete with other countries on pay.  However, we have now moved from a time of retrenchment with the moratorium on public sector recruitment and pay reductions to a time of recovery and building for the future.  With a recovering economy, the HSE is now in a position to offer a wide range of career opportunities to medical professionals.  Pay reductions are also being reversed under the Lansdowne Road Agreement and take home pay improved as taxation levels are reduced.</p>  <p>  It is also necessary to support training and career structures.  The MacCraith Group was established in 2013 to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures.  The Group made a series of recommendations in its three reports aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and importantly, planning for future service needs.  The implementation of the Group's recommendations is being actively pursued and monitored. </p>  <p>  In July the HSE launched an International Staff Nurse/Midwife Recruitment Campaign which focused on the UK to attract staff nurses and midwives to jobs in Ireland.  The current relocation package is up to &euro;1500 in vouched removal/relocation expenses including the cost of flights.  At present there is no closing date for this campaign, as the HSE welcomes applications from nurses and midwives who are interested in joining the HSE from abroad on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

In order to achieve a more balanced health service the vast majority of patients and clients who require urgent or planned care should be managed within primary and community-based settings.  This must be achieved while ensuring that services are cost-effective, safe and of the highest quality, and also well-integrated and aligned with relevant specialist services.  Significant steps have already been taken to extend the range of services provided in the primary care setting as well as, in the current year, extending universal access to GP care without fees to all children aged up to five years of age and all adults aged 70 or over.</p>  <p>  Primary care teams and networks located on the same site in a Primary Care Centre or in very close proximity in convenient, accessible, locations offer individuals and families the opportunity to avail of &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; primary care services and a greater range of health and social services in one location.  They also afford team and network members increased access to colleagues and the opportunity to work in a more integrated way.  The HSE is continuing the delivery of Primary Care Centres (PCCs).  To date, there are 90 Primary Care Centres in operation, 47 of which have opened since 2011.  These Primary Care Centres complement the existing network of smaller Health Centres around the country and a variety of privately-owned GP and primary care premises which are used to facilitate delivery of publicly-funded care to patients.  The next phase of the programme is to deliver an additional 52 Centres over the next three years as follows:</p>  <p> - Under the Public Private Partnership method, the contract for the provision of 14 PCCs has been awarded and it is expected that construction work will commence before the end of 2015, with the centres expected to be completed in 2017.</p>  <p> - Under the Operational Lease method, in November 2014, the HSE advertised an additional 73 locations for delivery of Primary Care Centres by Operational Lease.  The HSE is at an advanced stage of negotiation with developers in 24 new locations where Agreements for Lease have been entered into.</p>  <p> - Through the Exchequer Funded/Direct Build method, there are currently 14 additional locations where construction is underway or the centres are at advanced planning stage.</p>  <p>  The range of services provided through primary care centres varies according to local circumstances, which include the needs of the community served.  Amongst the core services concerned are primary care team services such as those of general practitioners and their practice staff, general nursing, public health nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work.  A wide range of other services are provided in these settings and may include child health developmental clinics, dental care, dietetics, community ophthalmology, podiatry, psychology, maternity/paediatric outreach services, adult and child/adolescent mental health services, psychiatry of old age services and  counselling and addiction services.  Primary care centres can also support other public services and communities generally by having meeting facilities that facilitate cross-sectoral working and support to a range of community-based organisations. </p>  <p>  Enhancements of service which are being implemented and which already enable patients to receive specific elements of care in the primary care rather than the hospital setting include:</p>  <p> - the appointment of Integrated Diabetes Nurse Specialists who support diabetics in the management of their condition;</p>  <p> - the recent commencement of a diabetic Cycle of Care for GMS patients whose doctor deems them suitable for this service;</p>  <p> - the provision, for children aged under six and who are diagnosed with asthma, of periodic checks to assist in the management of the condition;</p>  <p> - the provision of diagnostic radiological services in some PCCs, with access being further enhanced in 2015 with the provision of prioritised access to diagnostic ultrasound services via an external provider at six locations nationally, providing in excess of 16,000 scans per annum;</p>  <p> - the commencement in 2015 of new minor surgery services in 20 primary care locations.  In a full year it is estimated that 10,000 procedures can be provided in the primary care rather than hospital setting.</p>  <p>  There is potential for further expansion of the range of care provided on a multidisciplinary basis in primary care and the current negotiations on a review of the GMS GP contract will include consideration of such matters.</p>  <p>  There are now ten primary care-led community intervention teams in operation.  These focus on both hospital and admission avoidance and also in facilitating early discharge of patients from hospital.  Areas currently served are Dublin North, Dublin South, Kildare, Louth, Meath, Wicklow, Carlow/Kilkenny, Midwest (Limerick, North Tipperary, Clare), Cork and Galway.  A new CIT service will be commence in Waterford in the coming weeks.  Many of the CITs operate from PCCs and liaise closely with health professionals based at these centres.  At any one time, there are over 200 patients in receipt of CIT services in the community who would ordinarily have been in hospital.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt but that the developments in primary care which I have outlined above are strengthening the capacity of this sector to meet the healthcare needs of our growing and ageing population.  It is of course important to view these advances as merited in their own right and not primarily a response to or a solution to the pressures experienced in the acute hospital services.</p></reply>

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in (GP) out-of-hours co-operatives as a means of meeting the contractual requirement, such services have been developed and expanded over time such that they are now an essential part of our primary care services and help to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting.   </p>  <p>  Out-of-hours co-operatives provide urgent GP services to patients of participating practices outside normal surgery hours, i.e. between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. Monday to Friday and for the 24-hour period on Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays. GP out-of-hours services are delivered through 14 GP co-operatives nationally and five extended hours co-operatives in Dublin.  2,068 GPs (85% of GMS contract holders nationally) participate in out-of-hours co-operatives, along with 204 non-GMS GPs.</p>  <p>  The following range of services is provided, entirely or partially, by the GP co-operatives: Call centre; Telephone Triage; GP consultation at treatment centre or home visit.</p>  <p>  Currently, services are provided nationally in the following settings: 7 call centres and 1 satellite call centre; 82 treatment centres, including extended hours services; 13 peripheral centres.</p>  <p>  Since 2008, GP out-of-hours services have been extended in the following areas: Roscommon; Limerick City; Tullamore; Moate; Edenderry; Tallaght; Lucan; and Clondalkin</p>  <p>  Plans are at an advanced stage to extend services in Sligo, North Leitrim and West Cavan in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The HSE has commenced a review of existing GP out-of-hours services with a view to maximising efficiencies and to identify areas which would benefit from extension, within existing resources, of GP out-of-hours services.</p></reply>

Last December I convened the ED Taskforce to assist in dealing with the challenges presented by ED overcrowding and significant progress has been made to date.  </p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;117 million has been provided in 2015 to relieve pressures on acute hospitals.  In April, &euro;74 million was provided to reduce delayed discharges, lower the waiting time for Fair Deal funding and provide additional transitional care beds and home care packages.  In July, &euro;18 million provided to support the acute hospital system over the winter period by providing additional bed capacity and other initiatives to support access to care.  </p>  <p>  In preparation for the 2015/16 winter period, hospital groups have provided comprehensive winter resilience plans to the HSE.

Section 55 provides that the HSE may provide private in-patient services to persons who are not entitled to, or who do not have or have waived eligibility to public in-patient services. An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  </p>  <p>  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient. Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care. Taking out health insurance is optional. People who do not take out, or who choose not to utilise, their health insurance continue to have the same entitlement to services in the public hospital system. 46% of the Irish population has private health insurance and many people opt to be treated privately. The main benefits cited by people for having private health insurance are the choice of consultant and hospital.</p></reply>

This approach will include the development by my Department of a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning during 2016.</p><p>The Department of Health and HSE have sought to stabilise the workforce through initiatives such as the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure (also known as the Mac Craith Report) and the Taskforce on Staffing and Skill Mix for Nursing. </p><p>The Review of Medical Training and Career Structure involved a Working Group examining and making high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to improving graduate retention in the public health system; planning for future service needs; realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training. The Group made a series of recommendations in its three reports aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and importantly, planning for future service needs.

The average price of an item dispensed on the GMS scheme has reduced to below the price paid in 2002, while the average item price dispensed under the DPS and LTI schemes is now below the price paid in 2000.</p>  <p>  However, expenditure on high tech medicines increased from &euro;315 million to &euro;485 million between 2009 and 2014.  This increase is due to the introduction of highly expensive new medicines and the increased use of existing medicines.</p>  <p>  The reductions achieved to date are due to a sustained and ongoing programme of initiatives, which includes the implementation of price reduction Agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (now the Irish Generics Medicines Association).  Cumulative savings and cost avoidance generated between 2006 and 2014 amount to approximately &euro;1.5 billion.</p>  <p>  The introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as provided for by the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, has also contributed to the reductions in the cost of medicines.  The prices of reference priced products are generally of the order of 70-80% lower than the prices paid when medicines were on patent.  On the date of introduction of the 2013 Act, the HSE was reimbursing in excess of &euro;22 million per month on medicines reference priced in 2014.  By December 2014, this had reduced to &euro;10.3 million due to the combination of reference pricing, increases in generic utilisation and generic price reductions prior to reference prices.  Reference pricing delivered savings of over &euro;47 million in 2014, and is expected to generate in excess of &euro;25 million in additional savings in 2015.</p></reply>

That strategy is based on two key objectives: Firstly, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and, secondly, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.</p>  <p>  In furtherance of these objectives, I have intensively engaged with the Egyptian authorities, including the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Egypt&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland, and with EU and international partners, including High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms. Federica Mogherini. The Taoiseach also raised the case in person on two occasions with Egyptian President al-Sisi. The information we receive from all of these contacts is carefully considered and used in reviewing our approach to this case on a constant basis.</p>  <p>  Significant resources in Cairo and in Dublin continue to be deployed in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to both the citizen and their family. I would also note that Embassy officials visited this citizen in detention most recently on 23 November.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to accord a high priority to this case and our approach is guided at all times by the two key objectives set out above.</p></reply>

The approach taken is sometimes described as a "college of professionals" approach. In the first instance, a group of people who are deemed to have an expert knowledge of what the students in the target audience ought to be able to achieve in the subject concerned reach a consensus regarding the content standards of the syllabus.  This is achieved through the various committees in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).</p>  <p>  Following on this, these content standards are then put into effect as a set of performance standards by the State Examinations Commission (SEC).  Once these performance standards have been tested, reviewed and fully established, the SEC, in accordance with its Establishment Order, then endeavours to ensure that the standards remain consistent over time.</p>  <p>  As part of its remit the SEC is charged with maintaining standards year on year and it endeavours to achieve this by the processes it has in place for the preparation of examination papers and other test items, and by the quality assurance procedures it implements at the examining and appeal stages of the state examinations.</p>  <p>  All of the SEC's examinations are prepared in accordance with the principles outlined in the document,  The Preparation of Test Items &ndash; Principles and Protocol, available on its website at www.examinations.ie.  Similarly, all examinations are assessed in accordance with the key assessment principles of validity and reliability.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain standards, the Chief Examiner for each examination takes all necessary steps to ensure that the examination paper, the marking scheme and its application combine to ensure that established standard are maintained.</p>  <p>  Standards of achievement of large cohorts of students do not radically change in the space of a year.  A certain amount of variation from year to year may happen, and a gradual change in the pattern of grades may occur over time, provided the subject experts involved are satisfied that it reflects real changes in achievement.  Furthermore, syllabus change and other deliberate interventions may impact on grade patterns, as may changes to the size or composition of the cohort.</p>  <p>  The examinations are marked by examiners, (generally experienced teachers in the subject), who work under the overall direction and management of the Chief Examiner for the subject. Examiners normally mark scripts from a number of schools.  Examiners do not know either the region or the schools from which the papers they mark are drawn.  They have sight only of examination centre numbers and candidate numbers, thus maintaining the anonymity of the system.  There are no 'quotas' applied to the number of grades, including E, F and NG, coming from any examination centre or indeed from the overall batch of scripts allocated to any examiner or the cohort generally.</p>  <p>  The marking process is overseen by a team consisting of the Chief Examiner, a Chief Advising Examiner and a number of Advising Examiners, who monitor and advise the examiners in their work.  The Chief Examiner and the advisory team test the draft marking scheme at a two day pre-conference.  During the pre-conference, the draft marking scheme is also considered in the light of commentary and correspondence from teachers, professional bodies and other interested parties, before being applied to exemplars of candidates' work.</p>  <p>  All examiners attend at a training conference prior to commencing the marking. The training process involves the use of exemplars of candidates' work both for standardising purposes and for purposes of training examiners in the consistent application of the marking scheme.  Random sampling is conducted in the early stages of the marking which serves to assist in the appropriate adjustment, clarification and refinement of the marking scheme as well as an initial quality assurance on the work of examiners.  If the grade distribution differs substantially from the established norm, this is interrogated to determine the underlying factors and where appropriate adjustments may be made to the marking scheme before the full marking process executes.  Once the marking scheme has been finalised, the marking proceeds, subject to rigorous ongoing monitoring of the process.</p>  <p>  Ongoing and systematic monitoring is a critical element of the marking process. The monitoring is designed to enable each examiner to apply the agreed marking scheme consistently and accurately to all scripts.  A minimum of 5% of the scripts, marked by each examiner, is monitored by Advising Examiners during the course of the marking.  As a consequence of this examiners who are found to be off-standard are required to remark all scripts that had been marked to that point. This may result in grade changes.  Advising Examiners are also available to the examiners for consultation and advice throughout the marking period.</p>  <p>  The marking schemes in each Leaving Certificate subject are published shortly after the issue of the examination results and in advance of the viewing of their scripts by candidates.  These are issued to all schools and are available to download from the SEC's website.  The Junior Certificate marking schemes are published on the website.</p>  <p>  A formal appeals process is provided by the State Examinations Commission.  It is open to every candidate to appeal the result awarded in any particular subject.  The appeals system involves a sophisticated combination of measures. Candidates are provided with the option to view the marked scripts and are also provided with the facility to comment on the marking through a dedicated form. Appealed scripts are re-marked in accordance with the same standard as applied in the initial marking, and the same marking scheme as utilised in the initial marking.  Candidates may also view the appealed script after the appeal marking.</p>  <p>  Quality assurance measures are in place at each stage of the appeal process to ensure that the marking scheme is applied fairly to the work of each candidate. If a candidate is still dissatisfied with the result after the appeals marking has concluded, he/she has recourse to a review by the Independent Appeals Scrutineers and beyond that to the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  Implementation of the actions in the Plan is ongoing and good progress has been made in a number of areas.</p><p>New National Anti-Bullying Procedures for schools, which were published in September 2013, are currently being implemented by all 4,000 primary and post primary schools in the country.  Training materials for parents, teachers and Boards of Management are also being developed and rolled out.</p><p>The Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum provides a unique opportunity for young people to develop skills and competencies to learn about themselves, to care for themselves and others and to make informed decisions about their overall health and well-being. Cyber bullying should be considered in the context of our approaches to dealing with bullying.</p><p>Webwise, the internet safety initiative of the PDST Technology in Education, and the PDST Wellbeing Team (formerly the SPHE Support Service) have worked together, to develop the #Up2Us educational resource to be used by schools in implementing the SPHE curriculum in the Junior Cycle.</p><p>This Up2Us Anti-Cyber Bullying Resource is designed to enable students to develop a positive sense of themselves and a commitment to caring for themselves and others.  This set of ten lesson plans is intended to be used by teachers and schools who wish to address the issue of bullying as a whole, with particular focus on the issue of cyber bullying.</p><p>Under the recently published Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 one of the objectives is to promote responsible and ethical use of the internet and related technologies, which includes an action to develop additional learning resources for teachers to integrate cyber-bullying awareness and prevention into each school's provision for Wellbeing including its curriculum programme for Social, Personal and Health, Education (SPHE).</p></reply>

Independent students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to their parents' incomes.  The assessment as an independent mature student has to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted at very specific circumstances where students can demonstrate that they have been genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a period of time before commencing their studies.  Otherwise, he or she would continue to be assessed on the basis of parental income.</p>  <p>  If the student to which the Deputy refers considers that she has been unjustly refused a student grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she may appeal in the first instance to SUSI.</p>  <p>  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally.  The staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 2015/16 school year are set out in Department Circular 0005/2015 which is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The circular sets out the improvements to the staffing schedule for the 2015/16 school year for small schools.  These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for one-teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  This package of measures will provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools, recognising the essential social function which small schools can play, especially in isolated communities.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule in the context of Budget 2016.  The improved staffing schedule which is available on the Department website will be implemented for the 2016/17 school year.  The staffing arrangements for all schools for the 2016/17 school year will be published early in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data relating to schools, including teacher numbers.  The most recent published information relates to the 2014/15 school year.</p></reply>

These defined areas facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.  </p><p>My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for additional school places will arise.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Social Protection in addition to information from the Department's own databases.  It also uses data from the local authorities.  With all of this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  On 17 November last, I announced that 4 primary schools and 9 post-primary schools will open in 2017 and 2018, as a result of the outcome of the latest demographic exercises.</p><p>In the case of the 6 Year Programme, the positioning of the projects in terms of year to commence construction is informed by the anticipated progress that each project will make as it progresses through the various stages of the architectural planning process.  All projects will be progressed with a view to proceeding to tender and construction stages at the earliest possible opportunity.  My Department will be in communication with the schools concerned in due course in relation to the next steps to be taken.</p></reply>

UNESCO defines it as a practical way to create and establish a more rational organisation of the use of marine space and the interaction between its uses, to balance demands for development with the need to protect marine ecosystems, and to achieve social and economic objectives in an open and planned way.</p><p><i>Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth &ndash; An Integrated Marine Plan for Ireland (HOOW)</i>, published in 2012, recognises maritime spatial planning as a key enabler of maritime activities leading to growth and jobs. To support the implementation of HOOW, a dedicated cross-Department task force, the Enablers Task Force, was established in December 2012 to consider the development of an appropriate MSP framework for Ireland within which the scope and objectives of an overarching national plan will be defined. The task force report, endorsed by the Government in July 2015, is available at:</p><p>In parallel to the work of the Enablers Task Force, EU negotiations on a Directive on MSP progressed, leading to the adoption of Directive 2014/89/EU establishing a framework for maritime spatial planning in July 2014. The Directive contains a transposition deadline of September 2016 and requires Member States to have maritime spatial plans in place by 2021.</p><p>In broad terms, the Directive requires Member States to consider economic, social and environmental aspects to support sustainable development in the maritime sector and to apply an eco-system based approach to the co-existence of appropriate activities. The Directive also requires trans-boundary coopera tion between Member States and Third Countries in the development of such plans.</p><p>The Directive outlines the main objectives and minimum requirements of MSP and includes requirements for Member States to:</p><p>-designate a competent authority or authorities to implement the Directive;</p><p>-establish a legislative framework for maritime spatial planning;</p><p>-develop maritime spatial plans;</p><p>-ensure comprehensive public participation in the development of plans;</p><p>-organise the use of the best available data; and</p><p>-co-operate with other Member States and Third Countries.</p><p>When established the maritime spatial plan will provide a robust policy and forward planning context for considering applications for development in the maritime area. </p><p>It is intended to bring proposals to Government shortly concerning the administrative arrangements for implementing the Directive&rsquo;s requirements.</p></reply>

However, I do recognise the difficulty faced by households in accessing the housing market and therefore an affordable rental pilot scheme was announced as part of Budget 2016 with &euro;10 million being made available from the proceeds of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to fund a pilot in 2016.  The details of the Scheme are currently being finalised in my Department and will be completed by end-year, for rollout in early 2016.</p><p>The Scheme will be an ongoing annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions.</p><p>The pilot Scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall. It is intended that the scheme would be made available to employed households on low to moderate incomes, as well as being a possible support option for some households who qualify for social housing support.</p><p>A State policy intervention - such as a subsidy - would be applied to bridge the gap between what people can afford, and what the housing market charges. Such a scheme would also be expected to facilitate and incentivise private investment into this sector.  </p><p>The shortage of supply of housing is at the heart of the housing issues in Ireland and, in that regard, I recently announced, with my colleague the Minister for Finance, a package of measures to boost new housing construction and enhance supply at more affordable prices. These include:</p><p>-The enhanced supply of more affordable starter homes in key locations through a targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels;</p><p>-New National Apartment Planning Guidelines to be issued to reduce the cost of apartment building in Dublin City,</p><p>-Changes to aspects of the operation of Strategic Development Zones to enable swifter adjustments to meet market requirements; and,</p><p>-The Government&rsquo;s Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to examine funding for housing infrastructure on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The package also included a number of measures to support rent stability in the private rented sector, pending additional housing supply coming on stream in the coming years.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention. All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention and includes Rathcaled, Ballynacarrigy, Castletown and Finnea Co Westmeath.</p><p>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. </p><p>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 20,000 premises to date in County Westmeath with over 6,500 more expected to be served by commercial investment. Approximately 17,800 remaining premises in County Westmeath will be covered either by further commercial investment or be the target for the proposed State intervention under the NBP. The breakdown of premises covered per townland is available on the high speed Broadband map.</p><p>Over 40 responses were received following the publication of the NBP proposed Intervention Strategy in July last. Non-confidential versions of these submissions are being published and can be accessed at . </p><p>Meanwhile, my Department continues to review the technical and financial detail relating to potential new commercial investment proposals. I expect to proceed to formal procurement before the end of the year.</p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.</p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018 with an ambition of 100% coverage by end of 2020.</p></reply>
