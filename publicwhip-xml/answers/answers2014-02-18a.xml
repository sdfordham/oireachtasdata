As the declamping fee has remained unchanged since 1998 it is clear that clamping is being used to incentivise compliance with parking regulations, rather than as a revenue generating exercise.</p><p>  When properly used as part of a controlled and responsible parking enforcement regime, clamping is intended to modify driver behaviour so as to encourage the sustainable use of parking facilities, which is by its nature a finite resource intended for the common good.  Prior to the introduction of clamping in Dublin, the problems associated with illegal parking were endemic, causing difficulties for residents and traders alike who could not access parking during business hours, as metered spaces were often occupied by all-day commuters. Contrasting Dublin before the introduction of clamping with today, it is evident that the use of clamping as an instrument of  public parking policy has been highly effective.</p></reply>

The derogation was introduced to allow a 5-year period within which vehicles operating at heights in excess of the new limits could be withdrawn from use or to allow the necessary height reductions by operators. This derogation expired on the 31st October last. </p><p>  Following the expiry of the derogation, specific concerns have been raised with me by the agri-sector in relation to the effect that the 4.65 m maximum vehicle height restriction would have on the cost of transporting fodder. Unfortunately, these concerns were only raised by the sector immediately prior to the expiry of the 5 year derogation in October last, and not prior to the 2008 regulations being signed into law nor in the subsequent five years.</p><p>  Notwithstanding this, I have considered the various issues involved, consulted with my colleague Minister Coveney, with Irish Rail and the IFA and arising from this have asked my officials to draft regulations to allow for a very narrow exemption for the haulage of agricultural fodder, i.e. straw and hay only, from the height limits brought in by the 2008 regulations. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-18a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021800053#WRA01700"><p>Given our fiscal constraints, the main priority for transport under the  Capital Investment  Plan to  2016 is to protect investment made to date and  to maintain safety standards.   </p><p>  On the bus side the priority is to fund replacement PSO buses. There is also a small allocation provided to the National Transport Authority (NTA) for accessibility improvements at bus stops and bus stations. There is also some funding available to support improvements for bus passengers in the Regional Cities.</p><p>  In relation to Bus&aacute;rus, I am advised that because of its protected status, permissible changes to the building structure are limited. The NTA has provided some funds in recent years for the provision of enhanced information displays and passenger information systems at Bus&aacute;ras.</p><p>  I understand that discussions have taken place between the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann in relation to the need for further improvements but that substantial funding is required to proceed with these improvements.  Given the limited financial resources currently available both within Bus &Eacute;ireann and to the NTA under the current capital plan, it has not been possible for these station upgrade proposals to be advanced at the present time.  Should funds become available under the next capital plan then any contribution by the NTA would need  to have regard to the mixed use of the station for both PSO and commercial operations.  </p><p>  There are no plans to construct a new bus station in Dublin at present.  However, in relation to off street parking for coaches, following a review by the NTA, a  site owned by CIE has been identified and the NTA in conjunction with CIE is currently engaging with Dublin City Council in relation to planning. Subject to approval the aim is to have  the coach park ready for use in the autumn. This  facility is targeted at coaches with a layover period in the city greater than about two hours.   </p><p>  Dublin City Council and the NTA are also currently examining alternative locations for on street parking to facilitate tourist coaches as some existing spaces will be removed arising from the construction of  Luas Cross City.   Final proposals are expected to be provided shortly.  </p><p>  I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA in relation to further details regarding improvements at Bus&aacute;ras and coach parking provision. Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

A full range of marketing material is being produced which will include on-line information as well as maps, brochures and other material.  Other supports being put in place for tourism-related businesses along the route include digital platforms, sales plans, trade and community engagement, international publicity, domestic marketing and visitor engagement.  In addition, in order to drive international business, the tourism agencies last year introduced the route to overseas buyers for the 2014 tourism selling season. </p><p>  With regard to the Greenway in Co Mayo, according to Mayo County Council, who have installed electronic counters along the route,  the footfall on the Greenway was 170,000 visitors in 2011, 190,000 in 2012 and 208,000 in 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-18a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021800053#WRA02200"><p>I propose to answer Question 106 and 113 together.</p><p>  The Government attaches great importance to the continued operation of Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann. Their services are vital to many of our citizens and to the Irish economy. </p><p>  Unfortunately, CI&Eacute; is in a precarious financial situation and is dependent on continued bank funding. The three CI&Eacute; subsidiaries have incurred accumulated losses of &euro;230m over the period 2008 to 2012, a position which is unsustainable.  Given the pressure on the public finances, there is no possibility of additional funding by the Exchequer. To compensate for the reduced passenger revenues and PSO subvention, CI&Eacute; has engaged in a cost recovery program over recent years. The cost savings agreed last year by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus workers had to be implemented and I hope that the discussions with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann unions, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Committee (LRC) and which are due to be balloted on shortly, will also be successfully concluded.  </p><p>  The total PSO subvention payable to the National Transport Authority (NTA) for 2014 is &euro;209.7 m (a reduction of &euro;16.8 m from 2013).  The allocation of the 2014 subvention, including the amount payable to the three CI&Eacute; subsidiaries, is decided by the NTA in accordance with their PSO contracts with the companies.  The CI&Eacute; Group Business Plan has already factored in the expected cut in PSO subvention in 2014 and CI&Eacute; has negotiated improved bank facilities in relation to refinancing of the Group. I intend to propose no further reduction in subvention from 2015.</p><p>  The Government continues to provide substantial Exchequer investment in the public transport network despite the significant financial challenges.   Over the three years 2011-2013, the total Exchequer allocation to the three CIE companies, in respect of PSO services, free travel, school transport and capital expenditure, has been more than &euro;1.5 billion.  The priority must be to get a better return from the public transport system, through targeted investment, better use of existing resources and by using technology to make public transport more responsive and user friendly.</p><p>  While still in a difficult financial position, I have every confidence that the CIE Board and its subsidiary Boards are putting the necessary measures in place to ensure an improving position in 2014 and a return to financial viability. I will continue to support their determined efforts in that regard.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy Daly&rsquo;s reference to the West-Link toll bridge, a decision was made by the previous Government in 2006 to introduce barrier free tolling on the M50. Under the agreement reached between the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the National Toll Roads (NTR) to buy out the West-Link concession,  NTR was to receive annual payments of &euro;50 million, adjusted for inflation, for the years 2008 to 2020. The bridge was built with private funds and not tax euros and the situation is not comparable to public transport.  I am advised that the cost of compensating NTR for the buy-out was a matter for determination between the NRA and NTR in line with the 1987 West-Link concession Agreement. I had no role in those decisions.</p></reply>

However, I do appoint the board of the RSA and they receive some funding from my Department.  </p><p>  The Government decided in May 2011 to create a centralised NDLS under the RSA.  This decision was based on an examination of options for delivering driver licensing which showed considerable benefits from centralisation in terms of efficiency, uniformity of service, and security.  In addition, centralisation freed up significant numbers of staff in the local authorities for other work.</p><p>  The NDLS is structured with a central unit in the RSA and three outsourced contractors.  These are: a card producer for the plastic card licence; a front office to engage with the public; and a back office to process applications.  </p><p>  There have been a lot of problems with the speed of processing applications in the NDLS since the system came on stream last October.  I have had regular discussions with the acting CEO of the RSA regarding the difficulties people have experienced, and how the RSA proposed to address them.  The RSA acknowledged that there were teething problems when the service opened.  Some were technical and systems issues, while others related to new staff becoming familiar with rules and processes around driving licences and permits.   However, the system is improving.</p><p>  The RSA responded by increasing resources in NDLS centres experiencing delays, as well as in the licence processing centre, and providing further training to staff.  There are no major technical difficulties now affecting the service.  A booking system to allow for customers to make appointments has been operating in a Pilot Phase which was successful.  This system is now being extended on a phased basis to all NDLS offices.</p><p>  While I understand that there are still some backlogs in relation to applications, the situation has improved.   I have been informed that licence applications that are fully and correctly completed are being issued in a shorter timeframe than previously and work is continuing to achieve the target turnaround period of 8 days. The RSA has assured me that the remaining backlog largely has been cleared.  The NDLS can also respond to urgent situations where a licence is needed for travel abroad or for work purposes.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the policy of centralising driver licensing in the RSA is the right one, and that the legislation which the Oireachtas passed to provide for this is appropriate.  I have no plans to review the legislation.</p></reply>

I will consider whether to allocate further funding once the review of the operation of the CIS in 2013 is completed shortly. From the local authority output returns collated to date the indications are that it has been very successful in most areas.  A total of 299 schemes were completed in 2013 at an overall cost of approx. &euro;8.7 million, of which, approx. &euro;2.3 million came from local communities either by way of monetary contribution or the provision of materials, labour or machinery. This has resulted in over 173 kms of improved roads.</p><p>  The reality is we do not have as much funding for road maintenance as we would like, particularly given the recent severe weather which has caused significant damage to our regional and local road network. It is in this context that consideration will be given to whether additional CIS grants are allocated in 2014 while taking into account the impact that CIS grants can make in making available monies go further.</p></reply>

The other regulatory body &ndash; the Irish Aviation Authority &ndash; is not subject to FOI.</p><p>  Ireland has an excellent record and reputation in aviation safety and I am determined to maintain and defend that and ensure that public confidence is not undermined.  There is a comprehensive international framework in place to ensure aviation safety. The IAA performs its regulatory role in accordance with international and European standards and it publishes an annual safety report. </p><p>  The IAA is itself audited regularly by teams from international bodies including the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the European Aviation Safety Agency to ensure it is undertaking its regulatory activities to the required standards. </p><p>  The occurrence reporting regime in aviation is underpinned by standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and by EU Directives and Regulations. These require that both the information reported, and the reporter, are treated in a confidential manner. This system is critical in an important element in aviation safety. It is my view that the application of FOI to this system could be counter-productive and could, in fact, undermine safety. </p><p>  However, it might be possible to extend the FOI Act to other functions of the IAA. Last year, I brought Irish Rail under FOI. It is the first state owned enterprise or 'semi-state' to be so. Irish Water will also fall under FOI. Neither of these face significant competition from the private sector. I will examine the Deputies proposal and discuss it with the IAA before making a policy decision on the matter. I will also examine normal practice in other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

The most seriously affected were western and southern coastal counties, where many piers, promenades, sea walls, rock armour and adjacent roads and car parks were damaged, in some cases severely. Islands along those coasts also suffered badly.</p><p>   As part of the National Emergency Coordination Group for Severe Weather, my Department has worked closely with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government which has the lead role for severe weather events.  Last week, the Government considered a Report on the severe weather that affected Ireland from 13 December to 6 January and the damage caused to local authority, transport and other infrastructure.  The Government agreed that &euro;70 m euro would be made available for a programme of repair and remediation works. This funding will be directed to restoring roads, coastal protection and other infrastructure and amenities and includes &euro;16 m for roads, &euro;20 m for restoring coastal protection infrastructure, &euro;26 m for local authority infrastructure, tourism, amenity and community infrastructure, and piers/harbours, and &euro;8 m for other transport and OPW infrastructure, including &euro;1.5m for embankment repairs near Shannon Airport.</p><p>  In addition to the above, my Department estimates that damage to port infrastructure and facilities over the period of the earlier storms was in the region of &euro;4.4m. Ports will plan and carry out their own restoration works. All Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL)  aid to navigation services have remained operational but have been damaged in the earlier and more recent storms. Costs for damage to CIL property around the coast are estimated at over &euro;0.5m.  </p><p>  Further damage is likely to have been caused by the more recent storms and these will continued to be monitored by the National Emergency Coordination Group.</p></reply>

It is licensed by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). I am aware of the Memorandum of Understanding to which the Deputy refers. However I am not a party to it.  For the Deputy's information, the IAA is a notice party under the planning and development regulations so that details of any development with the potential to endanger or interfere with the safety, or safe and efficient navigation of aircraft are sent to the IAA. The issues of flight paths, minimum flying heights and safety regulation are also the responsibility of the IAA. I appreciate and understand that many residents from the areas surrounding Weston have concerns about the development of it. It is my desire that activity at Weston should take account of the concerns of local residents, with appropriate consultation.</p><p>  Local authorities are responsible for issues relating to planning. South Dublin County Council and Kildare County Council are responsible for land use and planning at and in the vicinity of Weston, including the nature and extent of operations at the airport.

The completion of this work and its publication in 2014 is one of my Department's priorities for this year. The purpose of this document is to have a clear framework for future transport investment, so that projects being promoted by different transport agencies can be robustly compared and interrogated. This framework will allow us to prioritise the types of investment that can enhance economic productivity, but also recognise that meeting the needs of people is a critical aspect of transport infrastructure provision. </p><p>  An integral part of this work is to understand and quantify the scale of future capital investment that is required to maintain our transport assets to their current standard.  In addition to this, there is a need to understand potential future demand levels and resultant supply constraints - and in particular where they are most likely to arise. This will allow an assessment of necessary investment levels to cater for demand growth and demand changes.  In terms of ensuring the efficiency of future investment, the assessment of specific projects will obviously remain subject to detailed appraisal of the costs and benefits of each individual project. </p><p>  A steering group is guiding this work and stakeholders and advisers such as Forfas have been involved in identifying strategic priorities. To ensure that wider stakeholder needs and concerns are fully addressed a public consultation on a draft framework will take place. </p></reply>

All of our main markets grew compared to 2012 and we enjoyed our highest ever number of visits from North America. Part of the success last year was certainly related to The Gathering with research suggesting that in the region of 250,000 of the additional visitors travelled to Ireland because of the initiative. </p><p>  In terms of targets for 2014, the approved Tourism Ireland Business Plan for 2014 contains a target of growing visit numbers to Ireland by a further 4% this year and growing the associated revenue from these overseas visits by 7%. As part of its actions to reach this target, Tourism Ireland will be undertaking extensive marketing campaigns throughout 2014.  Priority overseas markets will again be the United States, Great Britain, Germany and France, which together deliver almost three-quarters of all our overseas visitors but promotions will also continue in other markets across the world. Furthermore, I am confident that measures such as the retention of the lower VAT rate for tourism services, the reduction of the air travel tax to zero from April and the increased air access to Ireland will also help to ensure that the targets are met. </p><p>  In terms of new initiatives, Tourism Ireland, working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is placing a major focus on  highlighting the Wild Atlantic Way, for car touring and other forms of holiday. It will also promote key events, including the visit of the Giro d&rsquo;Italia cycle race, and the Croke Park Classic American football game, to encourage visits to Ireland. </p><p>  More generally, my Department is currently undertaking a review of Tourism Policy. The review is looking at all aspects of Irish tourism and a detailed analysis of all responses to the public consultation process is underway. Once the final tourism policy has been set, it is intended it will provide a robust foundation for a broader tourism strategy and action plan. I hope to have the policy document finalised by Easter. </p></reply>

I am pleased to confirm that Ryanair increased its business there by almost 30% in 2013. There is adequate capacity to handle any such expansion in the existing terminal.  I have indicated previously the question of the use of the old terminal does not arise as it has been decommissioned for use as an airport terminal. </p><p>  I am very conscious of the importance of Cork Airport in the development of the economy of the region as a whole, in particular, tourism. This is why DAA has established a Development Council for Cork Airport with its first meeting to take place in early March. This Council will provide for strong engagement with, and alignment among, key stakeholders in the Cork region and will serve to foster a common understanding, particularly at local level, of issues of concern, potential opportunities for growth and the operating performance of the airport.

I wish to underline the importance that Ireland attaches to the social dimension of the Open Skies Agreement and our commitment to the full implementation of Article 17 <i>bis</i>   of the Agreeement.</p><p>  My colleagues the Ministers for  Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection have responsibility for labour matters and social insurance matters respectively.  NAI has stated publically that it always follows the rules and regulations in all markets it operate in and offers competitive wages and conditions to all crew, regardless of crew base. My understanding is that NAI does not currently plan to operate services out of Ireland or base any of its aircraft crew in Ireland.</p></reply>

The agreement provides the legal framework for scheduled air services between the two countries and under the agreement it is open to any Irish, EU or Chinese airline to operate services between the two countries subject to the terms of the agreement. The establishment of such a service, however, has to be market driven and would be a commercial decision for any airline interested in initiating such a service. </p><p>  Enhanced air access to key tourism and business markets such as China has always been a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s aviation policy. I would very much welcome direct services to China and have no doubt that such a service would be of benefit to trade, tourism and other relations between both countries. </p><p>  The Irish airports and Tourism Ireland have attractive incentive and marketing programmes available to help support new services and I am aware the DAA have had discussions with Chinese airlines about the possibility of a service. The DAA recently signed a twinning agreement with Beijing Capital International Airport. The agreement is designed to enable the two airports to engage in a joint marketing initiative to deliver direct airline services between Dublin and Beijing. I intend to visit China later this year as part of a tourism and transport trade mission. As part of that I will seek to promote the value of such a route to my counterparts in the Chinese government and to the aviation and tourism industry there more generally.</p><p>  In the meantime, Ireland does have extensive one-stop connectivity with many Chinese cities through the established European hubs such as Heathrow, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt. In addition connectively with China has improved considerably since the commencement of Etihad&rsquo;s services to/from Abu Dhabi in 2007 and more recently Emirates services to and from Dubai in 2012.  </p><p>  Tourism Ireland has set an overall target of growing visit numbers by a further 4% this year and by 13% more than the 2013 figure by 2016.  The agency's Business Plan for 2014 and Corporate Plan for 2014-2016 include a number of actions to maximise the number of visitors from developing markets, including China.  I am referring this aspect of the Deputy&rsquo;s question to Tourism Ireland for a direct reply with further details.  Please contact my private office if a response is not received within ten working days.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-18a.168.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021800056#WRD01300"><p>The centenary of the outbreak of the First World War will be marked by events across Europe in August this year.  At national level, events to mark the outbreak of the First World War will take place over several days.  While detailed arrangements still to be settled, a Cross of Sacrifice monument at Glasnevin cemetery will be dedicated to the memory of the soldiers who died in the War.  Services of prayer and remembrance ceremonies will take place at national and community level.  Special presentations and exhibitions are being organised by the national cultural institutions.  Commemorative initiatives are also being prepared by local authorities, colleges and schools, heritage and community groups and media organisations.  The arrangements in Ireland will complement the commemorations taking place in Europe and the wider international community to mark this important centenary.</p><p>  The Government's approach to the Decade of Commemorations is guided by several principles: full acknowledgement of the totality of the island's history; the legitimacy of all traditions; the totality of the diverse history of the period; mutual respect; and historical accuracy.  These principles inform all activities undertaken in the commemoration of the First World War.</p><p>  My Department's commemorative policy is delivered by working in partnership across Government, and in conjunction with our partners in Northern Ireland and overseas.  Certain historical events call for joint British-Irish cooperation and attendance, in particular regarding the commemoration of the First World War.  The partnership allows for the further strengthening of the British-Irish relationship, grounded in a respect for the past and reconciliation.  Equally, commemorative events are an opportunity to strengthen and deepen North-South links.</p><p>  In November 2012, I attended the Remembrance Day commemorative services in Belfast, at the invitation of Belfast City Council.  At this ceremony, I laid a wreath at Belfast City Hall to remember those who died during the First World War.  On the same date, the Taoiseach attended Remembrance Day events in Enniskillen.  These two events marked the first occasion on which members of the Government participated in Remembrance Day ceremonies in Northern Ireland.  It served as a sign of a deeply embedded reconciliation process that is ongoing.  In 2013, I again attended the commemorative services in Belfast and the Taoiseach attended the remembrance service in Enniskillen.  </p><p>  On 10 January 2014, at Google's European Headquarters in Dublin, I launched an online archive of Ireland&rsquo;s First World War records together with Northern Ireland's First Minister, Peter Robinson, MLA, and deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, MLA.  The new archive,<i>'Ireland&rsquo;s Memorial Records</i> ', lists soldiers from the island of Ireland who died during the First World War or as a result of wounds sustained during battle.  The archive and launch event reflect the reconciliatory and historical value of an all-island approach to commemorating the First World War.</p><p>  My Department's Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds are providing support for a number of projects commemorating significant centenaries, including the First World War, as part of its regular funding of community and voluntary groups.  Several community and youth projects supported by the Funds have commemorations-related elements to their projects, exploring issues around identity and understanding of other traditions.  A number of these projects challenge the notion of separate histories and explore the ways in which drawing upon shared experiences can impact on contemporary societal relationships.  Commemorations have the potential to foster reconciliation and deepen understanding on a cross-community and cross-border basis between all traditions on the island of Ireland.  For this reason, the support provided by the Funds to the community sector is significant.  Several academic projects are also being funded through the Funds, facilitating research and public discourse on the First World War. </p><p>  Our network of Embassies will also participate as appropriate in commemorative events relating to the First World War in their host countries. </p></reply>

I am conscious of the difficulties experienced by Irish citizens who are undocumented in the United States, and I have met and spoken with many of them on my working visits there, and also with the various groups who lobby on their behalf.</p><p>  I have maintained contact, both directly and through our Embassy in Washington, with many key players in Congress who are influential in steering the process of US immigration reform.  Over the last five months, both the Embassy and I have had direct contact with some 70 Members of the House of Representatives and their staff.   These have included Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, Chair of the House Budgetary Committee and former Vice-Presidential nominee; Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee and several other leading Republican members of that Committee, including Immigration Sub-Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy; Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi; Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King; with House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and their staffs.  I have also maintained contact with key figures in the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives. </p><p>  I have reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government's interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  </p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last year.    </p><p>  Following passage of that Bill, the issue has been under consideration in the Republican controlled House of Representatives.  Public comments and private conversations which I, the Taoiseach and our Embassy in Washington DC had with leaders of the House Republican caucus, had given rise to expectations that the House would take up consideration of a series of immigration reform bills last autumn.  Unfortunately that did not come to pass.  </p><p>  Early last month, further public comments from Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Chief Whip Kevin McCarthy again raised hopes that the Republican leadership in the House saw the need to proceed with immigration reform.  To that end, the leadership prepared a set of draft principles that would guide their action on immigration in the House and presented them to the members of their caucus for consideration at a meeting on 30 January 2014.</p><p>  Informed by that discussion, Speaker Boehner gave a press conference on 6 February in which he expressed doubts that the House would pass immigration reform legislation this year.  He did reassert that immigration reform is something that needs to get done and that he would continue to consult his members.</p><p>  Given that expectations had again been raised, these and other comments are disappointing.  However, it is important that we keep our focus on the endgame.  The Government through our Ambassador in Washington DC and her team are continuing an extensive outreach and engagement with members of Congress and with the Irish groups and organisations who are lobbying for immigration reform.  We are monitoring the ongoing discussions within the Republican Party and continuing to press the case for addressing the concerns of our undocumented and to provide for a future legal flow for Irish immigrants to the United States.  The forthcoming St Patrick's Day visits to the United States will provide a further important opportunity to engage with US leaders in support of our immigration objectives and to assess the prospects for the weeks and months ahead.  We remain fully committed to the effort to achieve an outcome that addresses the needs of our undocumented and creates a legal path for the future.</p></reply>

The Irish Abroad Unit (IAU) manages a range of engagement between the Irish Government and the Diaspora; including support and recognition for Irish overseas in the form of the Emigrant Support Programme, the Presidential Distinguished Service Awards for the Irish Abroad, and structured engagement with the Diaspora geared towards economic development, through the Global Irish Network and the Global Irish Economic Forum.  The Unit also manages the Centenarians Bounty for Irish citizens not resident in the State, on behalf of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, and has responsibility for the Certificate of Irish Heritage, which is administered by an outside company.</p><p><b>Emigrant Support Programme</b></p><p>  The Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) provides funding to not-for-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish.  The key objectives of the ESP are to support projects and initiatives that address the needs of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable Irish emigrants; enhance access for Irish emigrants and Irish community organisations to local statutory and voluntary services; foster a more vibrant sense of community and Irish identity amongst the Irish abroad; and encourage closer links between Irish communities abroad and Ireland, to the benefit of both.  Since 2009, the Programme also supports projects aimed at creating practical results orientated links between Ireland and the global Irish, and projects that emerged as a consequence of the Global Irish Economic Forum and its follow up.  The Emigrant Support Programme allocation for 2014 stands at &euro;11.595m.</p><p>  Organisations in Britain and the United States receive the largest amounts of funding but recent years have seen a new wave of emigration from Ireland.  Many are heading to traditional centres of emigration but others are heading to new locations, building new communities, for example, in Western Australia, Western Canada and the UAE.  The Emigrant Support Programme supports organizations in these new locations to assist these new emigrants with the challenges they face on arrival in these countries</p><p><b>Global Irish Network/Global Irish Economic Forum</b></p><p>  In early 2010 the Global Irish Network was launched and currently comprises more than 350 senior Irish and Irish connected business people based in some 40 countries.  Network members come from a diversity of disciplines.  They have demonstrated a strong connection to Ireland and have a record of high achievement in international business or in assisting in the promotion of Ireland.  They provide Ireland with an invaluable resource of international expertise from which we can draw as we work towards continued economic recovery.</p><p>  To date, there have been three meetings of the Global Irish Economic Forum, in 2009, 2011 and, most recently in 2013.  Over these successive meetings, there have been changes in how they are conducted.  For example, in 2013, mentoring sessions were held to bring Enterprise Ireland clients together with Network members.  In addition, meetings were held outside Dublin for the first time, with meetings in Cork, Galway and Belfast. </p><p><b>Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad</b></p><p>The Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad was established in 2012<b>.  </b>The Award provides recognition by the Irish State for persons living abroad, primarily Irish citizens, those entitled to Irish citizenship and those of Irish descent, who have given sustained and distinguished service to Ireland and/or Irish communities abroad.  A High Level Panel based in Ireland considers all nominations received from abroad and makes recommendations to the Government and the Irish Abroad Unit administers the awards process.</p><p><b>Certificate of Irish Heritage</b></p><p>  The Certificate of Irish Heritage was introduced in 2011 to recognise descendents of previous generations of Irish citizens in an official way and give greater practical expression to the sense of Irish identity felt by many around the world.  The Certificate is administered on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by FEXCO, based in Killorglin, Co. Kerry.</p><p><b>Review of Diaspora Policy</b></p><p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will this year carry out a comprehensive review of our Diaspora Policy to examine all elements of our engagement with the Irish abroad.  The review will build upon the success of the Global Irish Network and the Emigrant Support Programme, and examine the needs and potential of both longstanding and new emigrants.  </p><p>  Consultations as part of the review will be wide-ranging, and will include Irish community organizations overseas, members of the Global Irish Network and other business figures, academia, as well as other Government Departments and bodies.</p><p>  The consultation process will begin shortly and conclusions of the review will be finalized this year.</p></reply>

The event was hosted and organised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p><p>  This was the third in a series of commemorative lectures forming the Iveagh House Lecture series.  Each address has recalled a significant event in our history; the first, by Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson in 2012, on the centenary of the Ulster Covenant, reflected on the life of Edward Carson, Irish unionism and its place in our political life today.  Last year, Governor of Maryland, Martin O'Malley, recalled the visit to Ireland fifty years ago of US President John F. Kennedy and reflected on Irish American relations.</p><p>  The Government is committed to the commemoration of historical events in an inclusive manner based on the principles of historical accuracy and in cooperation with key partners at home and abroad.  In line with this approach, the lecture was attended by guests from Ireland and Britain, members of both traditions in Northern Ireland, historians, leaders from civil society and elected representatives past and present.</p><p>  Several of the guests had been involved in the negotiation of the Declaration and in later phases of the Peace Process.  I was pleased in particular to welcome Kathleen Reynolds, representing her husband, former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, and members of her family, as well as former T&aacute;naiste Dick Spring.  </p><p>  My opening address reflected on the significance of the Declaration in paving the way for an eventual IRA ceasefire.  I noted the long, intensive and difficult work undertaken by the governments led by John Major and Albert Reynolds.  This work was continued and developed by John Bruton as Taoiseach.  I also acknowledged the immense contribution by US Senator George Mitchell, who was also in attendance, and who spoke about his personal experience of the peace process.</p><p>  John Major spoke of his work in building Anglo-Irish relations, his approach to negotiating peace and of how setbacks were overcome.  He spoke also of the deepening of the relationship between Ireland and Britain in the twenty years following the Declaration.  His comments were broadcast by RT&Eacute;.  I appreciated in particular his positive encouraging remarks on the future of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

They note the wide variety of other rights potentially affected by parades and other events and call for a new consensus based on rights, responsibilities, and relationships.  </p><p>  The proposals provide for devolution of responsibility for Parades to the Northern Ireland Executive, which would require legislation at Westminster and in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Such legislation would establish two new bodies which would take over responsibilities currently held by the Parades Commission.  </p><p>  An Office for Parades, Select Commemorations, and Related Protests would have responsibility for receiving event notifications and promoting dialogue and mediation among event organisers and local communities.  An Authority for Public Events Adjudication would in some cases set conditions on the relatively small number of events which prove contentious.  Determinations would be made by a seven-member panel led by a legally-qualified person.  Affected parties could pursue an internal review and judicial review.  A new Code of Conduct would be enshrined in legislation by the Northern Ireland Assembly. </p><p>  Throughout the Talks, I have made clear the Government's view to all participants and stakeholders that there is now a unique opportunity to make further progress towards advancing reconciliation and the creation of a truly reconciled and prosperous society in Northern Ireland.  That remains the Government's view and we will continue our engagement with the Northern Ireland Political Parties and the British Government to that end.  </p><p>  The Political Parties in the Northern Ireland Executive are currently discussing the Proposals, including those on Parades.  I and my officials are in regular contact with all of them, including with the Ulster Unionist Party.  I have invited Mike Nesbitt MLA, Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, to a meeting in Dublin at a mutually convenient time.  I have also indicated my availability to meet with him in Belfast.</p></reply>

This includes Embassies in all Eurozone and other EU Member States, with the exception of Croatia.  Following the recent Government Decision to expand the diplomatic network abroad, it is our intention that the new Embassy to Croatia will be fully operational in 2014 or as soon as practicable thereafter.  </p><p>  My Department has recently undertaken a Value-for-Money and Policy Review of our Bilateral Diplomatic Missions in the European Union Member States.  The final report has been submitted to me and presented to Government, and is now available on my Department's website.  The Review was directed by a Steering Committee comprised of an independent Chairperson and representatives from four Government Departments.  </p><p>  This Value for Money and Policy Review was undertaken in the context of the Government&rsquo;s wider Value-for-Money and Policy Review (VFM) initiative.  As outlined in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s <i>Public Spending Code</i> , the VFM initiative aims to secure improved value for money from public expenditure by analysing exchequer spending in a systematic manner. </p><p>  This Review concluded that Ireland's EU bilateral missions with their networking capacities have been, and will continue to be, a very relevant resource for a whole-of-Government approach to how Ireland maintains relations with its EU partners and to how Ireland can present a cohesive image of its values and foreign policy in the EU member states, both to Governments and to civil society.  </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of the recent Government Decision to expand the diplomatic network abroad.  This will include five new Embassies, including one in Croatia, and three new Consulates, which will be established in locations across South East Asia, Africa and the Americas. </p><p>  This expansion of the network is specifically designed to support Ireland's foreign trade and inward investment, and takes account of the soon-to-be published Review of the Government's Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, as well as the Value-for-Money and Policy Review referred to above. </p><p>  The expansion is also very much in accord with the recent report published by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade on the Contribution of the Department of Foreign affairs and Trade to Economic recovery. </p><p>The scale and presence of our diplomatic network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis.  Any decision to adjust the state&rsquo;s external representation will have regard to national priorities and available resources. </p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  I should point out that it was never intended that the USC would be a temporary measure.  It was designed and incorporated in to the Irish taxation system as part of its permanent structure and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.  </p><p>  As you may be aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by the Department of Finance in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available at;</p><p> </p><p>  As a result of the review, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum.  It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.   </p></reply>

The impact of serious and regular flooding on a property, including the issue of flood insurance, would be factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing the property.  </p><p>  In addition, one of the advantages of the banding system of values provided for in the legislation is to remove the need for precision in relation to the market value, except for properties worth over &euro;1million.

The EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC) generally provides that supplies of goods and services be chargeable to VAT at the standard rate but that lower rates are permitted in very limited circumstances.  Those circumstances do not extend to exempting flood gates from VAT. </p><p>  However, homeowners may avail of the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) in the carrying out of flood prevention works at their home, subject to compliance with the terms of the scheme. The HRI provides for tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a homeowner's only or main residence. </p><p>  Qualifying expenditure must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (inclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.  Works carried out between 25 October 2013 and 31 December 2013 will be considered to have taken place in 2014 for the purposes of awarding the tax credit. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the minimum threshold does not have to be reached by each contractor where a homeowner engages a number of contractors to carry out different works. So long as the aggregate payments reach the minimum threshold of &euro;5,000 inclusive of VAT, the homeowner will qualify for the credit.</p><p>  Work must be carried out by a qualifying contractor. If work is grant aided or, if any form of insurance or compensation is received in respect of the work, the amount of relief will be reduced.  The incentive runs to the end of 2015.  However, where planning permission for qualifying works is required and is in place before 31 December 2015, any work carried out between 1 January 2016 and 31 March 2016 will qualify for the relief.</p><p>  Qualifying expenditure under the incentive is expenditure which is subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  Expenditure which is subject to the 23% standard VAT rate does not qualify for relief.  Building services consisting of construction, demolition, alteration or reconstruction are liable to VAT at the reduced rate of 13.5% unless the value of goods, such as flood gates, etc., exceeds two-thirds of the total amount charged by the contractor.  Where this happens, the contractor will charge VAT at the standard rate of 23% on the total amount and this total amount is excluded from relief under the incentive.  A contractor may be in a position to invoice separately for materials and labour and, in such circumstances, the labour amount, that is chargeable at 13.5%, can come within the HRI relief.  This practice is acceptable provided the split between materials and labour is realistic and is not done to avoid VAT. </p></reply>

The impact of these decisions on tax revenue and employment is also modelled. </p><p>  When assessing the potential impact on the economy of such a measure, my Department must weigh the short-term benefits on economic output against the impact on the public finances. In this regard research produced by the ESRI as part of its Medium-Term Review of July 2013 is informative. Using the HERMES macroeconomic model, the ESRI tested the economic impact of a series of fiscal shocks to the economy. It includes simulations of the impact of a &euro;1 billion adjustment in income tax.  </p><p>  The results of the research suggest an income tax multiplier of -0.6   that is, a &euro;1 billion reduction in income tax results in additional GDP of about &euro;600m million over the forecast horizon. </p><p>  The relatively low GDP multiplier likely reflects the open nature of Ireland's economy and the fact that increased demand would 'leak out' through imports. The simulations also include the assumption that some part of a reduced tax burden would be saved rather than spent by households. This positive impact on output must be balanced against the impact on the public finances exerted through lower tax revenues. In addition, the Revenue Commissioners estimated that 856,000 tax units which equates to just over 39% of the tax base will be exempt from income tax in 2014.  It is also worth pointing out that it is generally accepted that low income earners spend a greater proportion of their disposable income in the economy. Therefore, any cut in the income tax burden would have no effect on the spending habits of these tax units as they would not benefit from the change.    </p><p>  When discussing the merits of such a measure it is important not to lose sight of the current fiscal position. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, Ireland's budget deficit remains one of the highest in Europe. In this context the opportunity cost of any large-scale revenue stimulus would be considerable. Moreover, any revenue shortfalls would have to be made up from alternative measures in order to continue to meet our deficit targets.</p><p>   In relation to the ESRI example, the simulations suggest that the deficit would increase by 0.5 percentage points of GDP and general government debt by just over 2 per cent of GDP, both by the end of the forecast horizon. Therefore, in relation, to the specific scenario put forward by the Deputy the increase in indirect taxes would be not be sufficient to cover the loss in income tax revenue.   </p><p>   Finally I would say that while there is a clear need to address the fiscal imbalances of the State, this Government is cognisant of the pitfalls of excessively taxing labour. Reflecting this, the Programme for Government contained commitments to not increase the marginal rate of tax.  My first three Budgets have achieved these commitments, which further demonstrate our commitment to encouraging labour supply and supporting employment growth into the future.</p></reply>

There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. The DRI will come into effect when the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational. This is not expected to take place until late 2014. </p><p>The overall Banking Union proposal involves an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks in the form of the single supervisory mechanism ('SSM'); a European deposit insurance scheme ('DGS'); a European resolution scheme commonly referred to as the Bank Recovery &amp;amp; Resolution Directive (BRRD) and; a<b></b>Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM)<b></b>  to coordinate the application of resolution tools to banks under the Banking Union.    </p><p>  As you are aware, one of the core objectives of Banking Union is to break the link between the sovereign and the banking sector by strengthening the banking system and making it more resilient. A key feature is the need to provide authorities with a credible set of tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in an unsound or failing bank so as to ensure the continuity of a bank's critical financial and economic functions whilst minimising the impact of a bank's failure on the economy and financial system, by requiring that shareholders bear losses first followed by creditors while at the same time minimising the costs for taxpayers.    </p><p>  Agreement on Banking Union is essential for Europe and we support the need to conclude the remaining elements namely the Single Resolution Mechanism as soon as possible. Finally, I can assure you that the Irish case for retrospective recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.   </p><p>  I remain confident that the commitment made by the EU HoSG in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected.</p></reply>

However, Ireland applies the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive, because Ireland applied a reduced rate to such services on 1 January 1991. However, this derogation is only permissible where the VAT rate applying is 12% or greater. In this case, it is not legally possible to introduce a 9% rate of VAT on all construction services. </p><p>  While it is possible for us to apply the 9% VAT rate to the construction of residential properties, this would involve having two separate VAT rates applying to construction services. This would be difficult to administer and could lead to underpayment of VAT. However, the home renovation incentive provides a tax incentive for property owners in the area of income tax. This incentive, which came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015, provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence. </p><p>  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate. The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (inclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;595. Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out. Works carried out between 25 October 2013 and 31 December 2013 will be considered to have taken place in 2014 for the purposes of awarding the tax credit. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the minimum threshold does not have to be reached by each contractor where a homeowner engages a number of contractors to carry out different works. So long as the aggregate payments reach the minimum threshold of &euro;5,000 inclusive of VAT, the homeowner will qualify for relief.</p><p>  Homeowners must be local property tax compliant on all properties they own in order to qualify under the Incentive, while building contractors must be tax compliant in order to carry out works. The scheme will be administered through Revenue s online systems. Contractors will be required to inform Revenue in advance of details of works to be carried and will also be required to notify Revenue in relation to any payments received in respect of the works. Homeowners will be able to view the information provided to Revenue by the contractor through the Revenue electronic systems and will also claim the relief through those systems.</p><p>  With regard to the cost of reducing the VAT rate on construction services, given the options for reducing the VAT rate, estimating a costing would not be appropriate as the Revenue Commissioners  statistics are not compiled in such a way as to provide a suitable basis to accurately estimate the impact on the Exchequer from the change mentioned in the question.</p><p>   </p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that receipts amounted to &euro;463 million in 2011 and &euro;483 million in 2012. This is broadly in line with the amounts anticipated to be collected in those years.  &euro;535 million was collected in 2013, due to an increase in the capital value of pension funds.</p><p>  The Jobs Initiative announced in 2011 included a range of revenue and expenditure measures to support the protection of existing jobs and the creation of new ones. It provided for the reduction of VAT on tourism services to 9% from 13.5% on a temporary basis until the end of 2013.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced in Budget 2014 the continuation of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector. The decision to retain the 9% VAT rate for tourism services will help maintain the momentum created by the success of The Gathering last year.  The estimated cost to the Exchequer of this measure is &euro;350 million in a full year and &euro;120 million for 2011 when it was introduced. This gives an estimated cost to the Exchequer of &euro;820 million to end 2013.</p><p>  A policy paper, published with the November 2012 Medium Term Fiscal Statement, found that the 9% reduced VAT rate appeared to have the desired impact both in terms of price pass through and by contributing to employment gains, with an additional 3,000 jobs in quarter 1 2012 relative to quarter 2 2011 in the labour intensive food and accommodations services sector of the economy. Further to this, the CSO website shows a 13% increase in employment from June 2011 to June 2013 in the food and accommodations services sector.</p><p>  The Jobs Initiative also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures, including a number aimed at retraining the workforce. While the details of the expenditure on these measures are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin T.D., I have been advised of the expenditure on a number of measures introduced under the Jobs Initiative.</p><p>  The JobBridge scheme has exceeded the 5000 places originally set out in the Jobs Initiative programme. Due to demand for places, extra funding was provided to the JobBridge scheme, with funding for a weekly average of 6,740 places in 2014. As of late 2013, the total number of internships taken up under JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, had passed 20,000. Indecon Economic Consultants undertook an evaluation of the JobBridge scheme in 2012 (published in April 2013) and their report found that 61.4% of the JobBridge survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships.</p><p>  While the expenditure figures for JobBridge during 2013 have not yet been finalised, the table below indicates the expenditure allocation to this measure under the 2013 Revised Estimates Volume (REV).<table><tr><th>   Expenditure Breakdown on JobBridge</th><th>2012 Provisional Outturn</th><th>2013 REV</th><th>2014 REV</th></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>&euro;000</td><td>&euro;000</td><td>&euro;000</td></tr><tr><td>National Internship Scheme - JobBridge</td><td>&euro;54,739</td><td>&euro;81,760</td><td>&euro;82,250</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>Numbers on the Scheme (weekly average on scheme)</td><td>2012 Provisional Outturn</td><td>2013 REV</td><td>2014 REV</td></tr><tr><td>National Internship Scheme - JobBridge</td><td>4,435</td><td>6,590</td><td>6,740</td></tr></table>  The numbers represented are the weekly average numbers on the scheme, not the year-end numbers. At year-end 2012, there were 5,532 on the JobBridge scheme and at year-end 2013 there were c. 6,000 on the scheme.</p><p>  In terms of measures in the education sector, the Springboard scheme as announced in the Jobs Initiative had initially provided for 5,900 places. During 2011 and 2012, over 10,000 people enrolled on programmes under the Springboard scheme.  The scheme was extended further in 2013 with 6,000 places under the third Springboard allocation. Further rollouts of the Springboard scheme have been considered and it is expected that further places will be provided under Springboard 2014. There are also education measures introduced under the headings of Back to Education Initiative and Specific skills training along with funding for Post Leaving Certificate courses. All these measures were aimed at retraining and educating the workforce to improve employability. Overall, in the region of &euro;270 million was spent in the 2011 to 2013 period on education measures.</p><p>  The Jobs Initiative also contained PRSI measures. These measures have helped improve competitiveness in terms of Labour costs, thereby protecting exists jobs and promoting new employment. It is hard to quantify the true cost of these measures to the Exchequer, but the original estimate of these measures for 2011 to 2013 was in the region of &euro;500 million.</p><p>  Overall, in the region of &euro;1.7 billion has been spent on measures introduced under the Jobs Initiative from 2011 to 2013. The difference between this expenditure and the amount collected under the pension fund levy has been made up by contributions from the national training fund and from allocations from within existing Departmental expenditure ceilings.</p></reply>

The levy will be in place for three years with an anticipated annual yield of &euro;150 million. As the levy is a percentage of an institutions DIRT liability in 2011, liability to the levy will relate to the size of an institutions Irish operation. The size of the levy is not unreasonable and should not jeopardise the banks  competitive or liquidity position.   </p><p>  The entire banking system has been underpinned by the strong Government support provided both here and abroad. I believe it is appropriate that the banking sector should make a contribution to the State's economic recovery.   </p><p>  As liability to the levy relates to DIRT payments in 2011, the levy should not impact on new entrants to the Irish banking market unless such new entrants take over the deposit taking business of a financial institution which had relevant DIRT payments in 2011. </p></reply>

However, the credit is more targeted, in that it is in the first instance, only available to the principal carer of the child.

The change follows a recommendation from the Commission on Taxation that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. </p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where Revenue had enough information, the new credit was given automatically and included in Tax Credit Certificates issued.  Where Revenue did not have such information the tax credit was not given.  The Revenue Commissioners placed advertisements in the national newspapers on January 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup>   to specifically bring this to the attention of affected taxpayers; who were advised to apply for the credit if they felt they were entitled to it.</p><p>  As the person in question does not appear to be the primary claimant, the tax credit of &euro;1,650 was removed from him and his standard rate band was reduced to the single persons level of &euro;32,800.  If a primary claimant gives up the credit in favour of a secondary claimant, then the secondary claimant may claim the credit provided they satisfy the relevant qualifying criteria. The qualifying criteria are:</p><p>  - the individual must not be married (unless separated), in a civil partnership (unless separated) or cohabiting;</p><p>  - the individual must not be jointly assessed as a married person or civil partner or in receipt of the basic personal tax credit for a widowed person or a surviving civil partner; and</p><p>  - the qualifying child must reside with the secondary claimant for at least 100 days on aggregate in the year.</p><p>In order to consider a claim from a secondary claimant, a completed form <b>SPCC1</b> and signed declaration from the primary claimant is required.

This is usually the parent who receives the child benefit in respect of the child from the Department of Social Protection. Child benefit is only paid to one parent, even in cases where child care responsibilities are equally shared. Therefore, the extension of such practice to this tax credit is logical.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, a principal carer can relinquish the new credit and associated extended standard rate band, such that it can be claimed by a secondary claimant provided certain conditions are met.</p><p>  It would not be feasible to split the credit, within a tax year, between carers in a way that would take account of the many different caring scenarios in existence. There is no one size fits all solution that could be employed and the tax code cannot be constructed in such a way as to cater for every possible scenario. However, given the provisions that allow the credit to be relinquished, it is possible for a separated couple to agree that each party can claim the credit in alternate years provided the qualifying conditions are met.</p></reply>

The solution offered to the borrower must take into account their individual circumstances, and comply with the policies and procedures of that institution, as well as the consumer protection framework including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears ('CCMA').  </p><p>  Specifically with regard to spilt mortgages, Section 2.5 of the Guidelines outlines the Central Bank's views on the key characteristics the Central Bank would expect to see in a split mortgage, and focusing on:</p><p>  - Treatment of the base loan of a split mortgage;</p><p>  - Treatment of future increase of income; and </p><p>  - Treatment of term of warehoused part of split mortgage.  </p><p>  The Central Bank's MART audits examine the banks' processes of determining and proposing sustainable solutions against the Central Bank's sustainability guidelines. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department has requested the six main banks operating in Ireland, and who fall within the Central Bank Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, to provide data on the restructuring situation in relation to all primary dwelling mortgages, both in arrears and not in arrears, on a monthly basis.  This process is separate from the Central Bank quarterly data collection and publication process and is intended to provide certain data on the level of mortgage restructures on a more timely basis.  It should be noted that these are voluntary and unaudited returns by the relevant banks, and given the short timeframe in which the lenders provide this information to my Department and more frequent reporting requirements, they have not gone through the lender's quality control process for regulatory return purposes.  However, it is considered to be a desirable development to place more timely and frequent mortgage restructuring data into the public domain.  </p><p>  The latest mortgage arrears and restructures data published by my Department for the period ending December 2013 shows that the lenders have 6,239 split mortgages for principal dwelling houses in place.  My Department publishes the number of split mortgages in aggregate format and not on an individual bank basis and does not collect data on the amount of mortgage debt warehoused as requested by the Deputy.</p><p>  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-18a.311.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021800058#WRF01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 to 203, inclusive, together.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Article 135(1)(i) of the EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC) provides that Member States shall exempt betting, lotteries and other forms of gambling, subject to the conditions and limitations laid down by each Member State.  The Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 provides that the acceptance of bets that are subject to betting duty are exempt from VAT. The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013, currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, proposes to licence remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries. Once the Bill is enacted, section 49 of the Finance Act 2011, which provides that these operators are chargeable with betting duty and betting intermediary duty under Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 2002, will be commenced.</p><p>  The acceptance of bets is the supply of a service for VAT purposes.  The place of supply of a service to a non-taxable person for VAT purposes is the place where the supplier s business is established.  The extension of the betting duty to remote (online) bookmakers and betting intermediaries will not, of itself, bring such operators within the scope of Irish VAT if they are not established in Ireland.  The specific facts of each case would have to be considered in deciding if an operator is established in Ireland.  Similarly, the extension of the betting duty will not, of itself, bring operators within the charge to corporation tax.  The corporation tax code looks at whether non-resident companies, which carry on a trade here through a branch or agency, are chargeable to tax by reference to whether the branch or agency-related income may be attributable to a permanent establishment here.</p><p>  Businesses, such as bookmakers, that are exempt from VAT are not required to register for VAT in relation to their supplies or to make bi-monthly VAT returns.  Businesses that are registered for VAT generally make a bi-monthly return that simply provides details of the total VAT on sales and the total VAT on purchases.  Businesses that are not established here have no requirement to make Irish VAT returns.  For these combined reasons it is not possible to report the total tax revenue raised in 2013 from the industry.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their overall approach to tackling compliance is to make the appropriate intervention following careful appraisal of the risk factors in each case.  Not all interventions conducted are in the form of an audit. The focus may vary from a comprehensive examination of all the taxes and duties for which a taxpayer may be liable, to a detailed check of a single tax-head, or a concentration on a single issue of concern.  This targeted approach is greatly supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including the Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling system REAP, integrating information obtained from multiple sources, and categorising taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria, including details of the compliance behaviour of the taxpayer in relation to filing and paying their taxes.</p></reply>

However, it is the case that in Budget 2014 tax relief for medical insurance premiums was restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.</p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the number of individuals insured has reduced over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs is unsustainable. If the relief were to remain unchanged and the trend was to continue, the cost would increase to approximately &euro;1 billion by 2020.</p><p>  Prior to this reform the State was effectively paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums via the system of income tax relief. In effect this means that those taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who have had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, are providing financial support via the tax system to those individuals who can afford such insurance.</p><p>  Although it is true that the restriction of the tax relief may have in some cases, led to a net increase in medical insurance premiums payable by individuals, it should be noted that many would only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals choose to purchase.</p><p>  The measure to restrict tax relief in respect of medical insurance premiums was approved by the D&aacute;il via Financial Resolution on Budget night and confirmed by the Oireachtas via the enactment of Section 8 of Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, which was signed into law by the President on 18 December 2013. I have no plans to review the restriction in the short term.</p></reply>

The issue of provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting.</p><p>  The Government is helping those who have been affected by flooding, by aiming to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works.  This involves:</p><p>  (a) prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities to address those areas of greatest need   including areas where industry are finding it most difficult to provide cover  - so that flood relief programmes can have maximum impact, where economically feasible,</p><p>  (b) improving channels of communication between OPW and the insurance industry with the objective of ensuring that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding, and</p><p>  (c) providing humanitarian assistance under the Dept. of Social Protection Humanitarian Assistance Scheme which gives financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes as a result of the flooding.</p><p>  This coordinated whole-of-Government approach is led by OPW with relevant local authorities and other bodies to maximise the level of resources available to address flood relief works.  Because of cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, it is an approach which will see benefits over the medium and long term.</p></reply>

No. 147 of 2013) as having "significant pyritic damage". These Regulations describe the methodology that must be used when a property is being assessed for pyrite damage. The assessing and testing procedures that must be carried out are highly technical and specialised and have to be carried out by an appropriately competent person such as an engineer or a geologist.</p><p>  The LPT exemption does not apply until such time as the property has been assessed and a certificate confirming &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; has been issued. This is the only type of certificate that is relevant and a homeowner cannot claim the exemption until it has been issued. This means that, in the absence of the relevant certificate, LPT must be paid up front or by means of one of the approved phased payment arrangements.</p><p>  Special arrangements apply in respect of the years 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners who do not have the relevant certificate on the first liability date of 1 May 2013 (liability date for 2013), or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014). While they are required to pay LPT for those periods, they may reclaim the tax paid if they obtained the certificate by 31 December 2013 and notified the Revenue Commissioners in writing by 31 January 2014. Such retrospective treatment only applies in relation to the years 2013 and 2014. The standard procedure is for homeowners to start the period of exemption from the liability date following the issue of the certificate. For example, a homeowner who has the relevant certificate on 1 November 2014 (liability date for 2015) can claim the exemption for the five year period of 2015 to 2019 but cannot reclaim LPT paid for any year prior to 2015.</p><p>  The rules governing when, and for how long, the exemption applies are complicated and are best explained by the use of examples. I am advised that detailed information and examples on how the exemption for residential properties with significant pyrite damage operates are provided by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, on www.environ.ie, and by the Revenue Commissioners in the LPT section of their website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.

However, it appears to me that the thrust of the Deputy's question is more to do with  whether an individual in receipt of rental income can be considered to be engaged in a trading activity.</p><p>  In that regard, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under existing legislation income tax is charged under Schedule D of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of a number of sources of income, which are classified into five separate Cases. Under this provision, rent received by landlords (individuals and companies) from property in the State is chargeable to tax under Case V, while income from trading activity in the State is chargeable under Case I. Therefore, for tax purposes, rental income is viewed as distinct from income arising from trading activity.</p><p>  In the case of trading activity, the law provides that taxable income is closely aligned to the accounting profit (subject to certain explicit prohibitions). In the case of rental activity, however, taxable income is the gross rent as reduced by a limited number of specified deductions as set out in section 97 (2) TCA 1997.</p><p>  These are:</p><p>  - any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>  - the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>  - the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p><p>  - the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and</p><p>  - payment of local authority rates.</p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.I have no plans to change the current taxation distinction between rental income and income arising from trading activity. Neither have I plans to extend the range of allowable deductions from gross rental income in arriving at taxable income for Case V purposes, save for my intention, as stated in earlier Parliamentary Questions to allow for a deduction for Local Property Tax. Such a change will require an amendment to the primary law but the manner and timing of this has not yet been considered.</p></reply>

The SGP is a rule-based framework that aims to co-ordinate national fiscal policies in the economic and monetary union.</p><p>- To monitor and assess compliance with the budgetary rule as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Act.  The budgetary rule requires that the Government's budget is in surplus or in balance, or is moving at a satisfactory pace towards that position.</p><p>- In relation to the budgetary rule, to assess whether any non-compliance is a result of 'exceptional circumstances'.

An intensification by the Central Bank of its engagement with mortgage lenders to require them, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, to propose and conclude sustainable and durable alternative arrangements to their customers in mortgage arrears; targets have, so far, been set for the period to end of June 2014 and by this date the banks will be required to have proposed sustainable solutions to 75% of mortgages which are more than 90 days in arrears and to have concluded solutions with 35% of such mortgages.</p><p>  2. Significant reforms to personal insolvency and the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland to make it more accessible for people with unsustainable personal and mortgage debt to address their position;</p><p>  3. Updating the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to provide additional safeguards to co-operating borrowers while also promoting and encouraging efforts by both lenders and borrowers to meaningfully address mortgage arrears or pre-arrears;</p><p>  4. Mortgage to rent which is now available as a social housing response to allow people to remain in their house, where possible; and</p><p>  5. The provision of an independent mortgage information and advice service.</p><p>  Regarding progress on the MART targets, the Central Bank has indicated that all six mortgage lenders covered by the MART process have reported that they met the 20% proposed sustainable solutions target for the second quarter of 2013 and also the 30% target for the third quarter in 2013.  In particular, with respect to the third quarter 2013 target, which is the latest available data, the lenders have reported to the Central Bank they had issued proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears against the 30% target. </p><p>  Furthermore, the Deputy may also wish to note, that according to information collected by my Department for the 6 main lenders, in the case of private dwelling homes some 51,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of permanent restructuring following engagement between borrower and lender.  A further 21,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of temporary restructures.  The data published by my Department and the Central Bank would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in early arrears and putting in place appropriate measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.   </p><p>  Taken together, the framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.  However, early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long-term mortgage restructures is being put in place.  However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this.</p></reply>

I note Mr. Trichet's comments in relation to how the Irish programme progressed, and the scale of the banking crisis in Ireland.  Our focus now is on continuing the recovery in the economy and in the public finances which enabled us to exit from our programme successfully last year.  That will be the key to our future success.</p><p>  Mr. Trichet appeared before the Committee as part of the EP's own initiative report evaluating the structure, the role and operation of the Troika actions in euro area programme countries. The Committee also met with European Commissioner Rehn, and ESM Managing Director Klaus Regling.

Ireland has welcomed both the OECD BEPS report of February 2013 which identified the problems of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, and the subsequent BEPS Action Plan published in July 2013, which outlined 15 actions to be taken to deal with the problems identified in the report.  The plan is essentially a roadmap, with a timetable for completion of actions varying from September 2014 to December 2015. </p><p>  As a result of this work, the OECD may change its international tax guidelines and make recommendations regarding mismatches which exist between different countries' rules, which countries would have to strongly consider implementing in their national legislation or tax code.  In addition preparatory work is under way on a multilateral instrument to which countries will be expected to sign up which will implement certain measures on a multilateral basis. </p><p>  The Government published Ireland's International Tax Strategy as part of Budget 2014.  It includes an International Tax Charter which sets out Ireland's policy objectives and commitments on a range of international tax issues.  The Finance (No 2) Act 2013 ensured that, in relation to our tax treaty partners, a company cannot be 'stateless' in terms of its place of tax residence.  The &quot;stateless&quot; company change will not by itself bring an end to international tax planning.  That would require concerted multilateral action by many countries acting together.  World leaders (G8, G20) have already acknowledged that a global, co-ordinated approach was needed.  The OECD is leading this concerted international initiative through its BEPS project.  Ireland is an active participant in this process.</p></reply>

The Act also sets out the Council's functions, which can only be amended through primary legislation.</p><p>  In that context, Regulation (EU) 473/2013 introduced a requirement that draft budgets and the stability programme update must be based on macroeconomic forecasts that are produced or endorsed by an independent body.  This endorsement function has been set out in an amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 and has been assigned to the Fiscal Council. </p><p>  This process took place for the first time as part of Budget 2014.  The endorsement states: The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council endorses as within the range of appropriate projections the set of macroeconomic projections prepared by the Department of Finance for Budget 2014 for the years 2013 and 2014 provided to the Council on 30 September 2013.  Since its establishment, the Council has published five Fiscal Assessment Reports and three other papers, all of which can be found on the Fiscal Council's website.  In line with commitments I gave during the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012, I respond to these reports, usually in my next fiscal policy publication.  However, given the gap between the last Fiscal Assessment Report in November 2013 and the publication of the stability programme update next April, I responded to the Council in writing on the 19<sup>th</sup> December 2013.  My response can be found on the websites of the Council and my own Department.</p><p>  The establishment of the Council has strengthened the fiscal governance of the country and its reports have widened and deepened the debate on fiscal policy.</p></reply>

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) was contracted as independent assessors and to provide project management resources.  E&amp;Y was contracted to conduct the loan file and impairment model reviews of AIB and PTSB.  KPMG was contracted to conduct the loan file and impairment model reviews of Bank of Ireland.  Third party costs for the BSA have still to be finalised, however it is expected that the final cost will be approximately &euro;11 million, including VAT. The CBI is responsible for paying for these services as the contractee.  However all costs incurred on the Financial Measures Programme are 100% recovered from the covered banks subject to the reviews.</p><p>  In common with all other significant banks in the Eurozone, the Irish banks are required to undergo a Comprehensive Assessment (CA) prior to the ECB assuming responsibility as the competent supervisory authority in November this year (2014).  The CA has a number of components including an Asset Quality Review (AQR) and a Stress Test.  The SSM AQR is similar to the CBI BSA exercise conducted in 2013 and accordingly the work performed in the BSA will go some way to satisfying the AQR requirements and informing the CA results.</p></reply>

The introduction of new Single Person Child Carer Credit achieves this outcome.  The Government, by allowing for the relinquishing of the credit to a secondary claimant, where a principal carer chooses to do so for whatever reason, actually provided for an additional option for single person carers, over and above that recommended by the Commission.</p><p>  As the credit is available to all qualifying persons, regardless of gender, I do not believe it could be construed as being discriminatory.

As of December 2012, the total number of full-time equivalent staff in permanent tsb was 2,305.</p><p>  There were 1,182 staff in IBRC at end December 2011.  All staff were made redundant on the date of liquidation (7<sup>th</sup> Feb 2013).  However many were rehired immediately to assist with the liquidation.  There were 566 staff remaining at end November 2013.</p><p>  Ulster Bank announced a reduction in staff numbers of 950 in 2012 and the implementation of this process is ongoing.  The Deputy will be aware that RBS is conducting a review of Ulster Bank to identify a viable and sustainable business model to support the Northern Irish and Irish economies.  The report is expected this month.  I am pleased with this commitment by RBS to remaining in the Irish market and look forward to hearing details of the business model. </p><p>  It is important to note that, whilst staff numbers have reduced in certain institutions, some of these jobs have been outsourced and overall numbers employed have not suffered the full reduction.</p><p>  In fact, employment in the sector increased in 2013.  The Quarterly National Household Survey (Q3 2013) shows the seasonally adjusted quarterly change in employment for those in the  Financial, Insurance and Real Estate sector.  Between Q2 and Q3 2013 there was an increase of 1,600 jobs in the sector.  <b> </b>   </p></reply>

The last phase of the Budget 2012 measure takes effect from September 2014.  This will bring the pupil threshold for a 2-teacher school to 20 pupils (up from 12 pupils).  While I acknowledge the concerns raised about this budget measure, it must be seen in the context of the major challenges the Government has in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent possible.  I am confident that the qualified and registered teachers in these schools will be in a position to continue to provide a high quality education to students.  The challenge will be to ensure that the resources that can be provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.</p><p>  An appeals process is available to schools affected by the measures introduced in Budget 2012.  Circular 0007/2014 which is available on the Department website provides the criteria under which schools can make an appeal.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>  Educational quality for the pupils has to be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  It is also necessary to consider the needs of local communities and of course there are wider social and cultural factors that need to be considered.  Given our population growth, we have increasing enrolment at all levels of education which is expected to continue in the medium term.  Many pupil places are required in areas that currently have no school provision at all and we have schools in areas of stable or declining population with relatively low pupil numbers.</p><p>  Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by my Department in a value for money review which I am considering in consultation with my Government colleagues.  My intention is to publish the report of the review on completion of this consideration process.</p></reply>

Measures have been taken by my Department and the Teaching Council to alleviate difficulties faced by teachers in this regard. </p><p>  One measure relates to the minimum service requirement for probation purposes to secure registration with the Teaching Council as a primary teacher being decreased from 170 days to 100 days in the 2011-12 school year.  If an applicant is unable to complete the requirements of a registration condition within the specified period, he or she may apply to the Council for an extension to that period. </p><p>  In addition, under circular 46/2011 my Department allowed schools and ETBs to participate in the National Internship Scheme, JobBridge, administered by the Department of Social Protection should they so choose. </p><p>  JobBridge can provide valuable teaching experience to teachers and assist them in securing employment subsequently. Particularly, a JobBridge internship may allow a newly qualified teacher to undergo the probation process and become registered without conditions with the Teaching Council, providing a pathway to an increased range of a career opportunities. </p><p>In the wider context, my Department is endeavouring to minimise the impact of recession wherever possible, this includes provision for additional teachers in primary and post primary schools, as well as additional resource teachers for children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

These arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the needs and priorities of the service are met. Given the importance of the teaching experience and expertise required for the role, it is a condition of the sanction received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is set at five years.</p><p>  The support services, including the Special Education Support Service (SESS), must engage in succession planning as a key strategy in ensuring continued support for teachers and school leaders in implementing national education policy priorities and CPD.</p><p>  Teachers continue to be employed by their Boards of Management while on secondment to work with the support services. Secondments are renewed, where necessary, on an annual basis and are subject to a number of provisions including the five-year limit referenced above, the priority needs of the service and the Board of Management's continuing approval.  There are eighteen full-time members on the SESS programme who are currently seconded from their primary and post-primary schools.  </p></reply>

The Report provides the initial findings from Ireland and is part of the Net Children Go Mobile European two-year research project under the European Commission's Safer Internet Programme. It builds on previous research by the EU Kids Online network into children's risks and safety online. My Department has provided funding towards the Irish element of this research and I look forward to the final report which is expected later in the year.   In January 2013, my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and I published the Action Plan on Bullying. Since then, good progress has been made on implementing actions designed to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools. These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyber bullying, are addressed. </p><p>  New National Procedures on Anti Bullying which include a specific reference to cyberbullying were launched last September. These are currently being adopted and implemented by all 4,000 primary and post primary schools in the country.</p><p>  My Department has supported awareness raising initiatives in relation to tackling bullying.  These include Safer Internet Day, an initiative, targeted at young people, to address internet safety issues, including cyberbullying.  I was very pleased to launch Safer Internet Day 2014 in Ireland last week.  </p><p>  Central to promoting safer use of the Internet by young people is a strong commitment to changing behaviour and raising the knowledge, skills and attitudes around preventing, responding to and reporting cyber bullying incidents. The continued implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying will increase capacity in these areas and build on my Department's current strategy to ensure that internet safety is mainstreamed throughout schools' teaching, learning and other practices. Resources are available on www.webwise.ie and include guidelines on developing Acceptable Use Policies.</p><p>  Implementation of these and other actions identified in the Plan will continue in 2014.</p></reply>

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) does not have a role in setting the contractual hours of work of SNAs.</p><p>Secondly, in relation to working hours for SNAs I wish to confirm that no report was prepared for the Department regarding the working hours of Special Needs Assistants prior to the introduction of Circular Sp.

Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary)  Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15/05 (Primary)  </p><p>This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs. These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time. </p><p>The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in these standard SNA contracts of employment.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year. </p><p>SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. I should point out that this divisor was agreed with both of the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.</p><p>Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS HOURS.  Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.</p><p>This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;</p></reply>

The annual increment was normally paid on the anniversary of appointment provided performance during the year is satisfactory. An exception is in the case of statisticians where at particular intervals and subject to satisfactory service, their salaries can be moved up by an number of increments to mitigate the reduced promotional opportunities in the area. Currently, my Department is applying the provisions of the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA), which came into effect from 1st July, 2013, to the payment of increments for all of its staff.  One of the measures agreed under the HRA was that staff increments - after payment of their first increment after introduction of the HRA - are to be deferred for periods of between three months and six months depending on salary level as follows:</p><p>- Less than &euro;35,000 &ndash; one three month increment freeze</p><p>- &euro;35,000 to &euro;65,000 &ndash; two three month increment freezes</p><p>- Above &euro;65,000 to max of PO (higher) scale &ndash; two six month increment freeze</p><p>- Salaries starting over &euro;100,000 &ndash; incremental progression suspended for three years</p><p>  In addition, as a balancing measure, the Agreement provides that for staff earning between &euro;35,000 and &euro;65,000* and on the maximum of their salary scale before or during 2013 as outlined below.

There have been some unexpected issues on the industry side requiring finalisation but I am confident that, in the coming weeks, I will be in a position to make an announcement on an agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the industry and the OPW.</p><p>  The OPW has to date provided information on 12 completed flood relief schemes in an agreed format to Insurance Ireland and I expect to see that, in these protected areas, the insurance industry recognises this significant capital investment on behalf of the taxpayer, and insures properties benefiting from that investment.</p><p>  It is important, nevertheless, to state that the OPW has no role or function in relation to the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry or of insurance matters generally. I am aware that the issue of obtaining insurance cover continues to cause great difficulty to people in certain locations.  Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case by case basis but, where flood defence investments have been made and the standard of protection can be verified, I see no reason why the insurance industry cannot provide flood insurance cover in these communities.</p></reply>

Compensation was paid in respect of loss or damage arising in connection with interference with property during the construction of the works, as provided for in the Acts.</p><p>  The Corrib Clare Arterial Drainage Scheme was constructed by the OPW between 1954 and 1964. The purpose of the scheme was to provide outfall to facilitate land drainage.  Maintenance of the scheme channels and associated structures, including those in the area in question, is carried out on an ongoing basis, in accordance with the OPW's statutory obligations under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</p><p>  In 2011, the OPW carried out substantial advance works for the Clare River (Claregalway) Drainage Scheme, the purpose of which is to reduce flood risk in the area. It is expected that construction of the remaining elements of the scheme will commence this year. I understand that the advance works had a significant beneficial effect in the area during the recent storms.</p></reply>

This significant allocation, coming on top of capital expenditure of &euro;270m in the 1996 &ndash; 2011 period, reflects the priority which is attached to addressing the problem of flood risk nationally.  The multi-annual allocation will enable the Office of Public Works (OPW) to continue to progress its current flood risk management programmes including major capital flood defence schemes, minor works, and the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. In addition, the Government is also spending approximately &euro;15 million per annum in current expenditure on an ongoing maintenance programme of completed arterial drainage and flood defence schemes.  This excludes works undertaken and funded by local authorities on flood defence infrastructure under their remit.</p><p>  The CFRAM Programme, examining the options for State investment in flood defences over the medium to long term and the Programme, focusing on 300 areas of potentially significant risk, lies at the core of the assessment of flood risk and the long-term planning of the flood risk management measures throughout the country, including capital structural and non-structural measures.</p><p>  The CFRAM Studies are comprehensive catchment-based studies through which, following public consultation, detailed flood maps are produced and flood risk management measures are assessed and taken to outline design. These measures will be prioritised and set out in a Flood Risk Management Plan.</p><p>  The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis using Multi-Criteria Analysis.  More information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie.</p><p>  Pending the completion of the CFRAM Programme, the OPW is continuing with its programme of major flood relief schemes. These schemes are focused on locations throughout the country where significant flood events have occurred in the past. Cost benefit analysis is the standard methodology used to determine priorities and for selection of major schemes.  Benefits are measured in terms of the damage and loss avoided.</p><p>  The identification and assessment of smaller scale flood risk problems and mitigation measures at local level within each county is a matter for the local authority concerned. It is open to local authorities to apply for funding under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme, introduced in 2009. The Scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.</p></reply>

The Scheme covers the area from Inniscarra Dam to downstream of the City on the River Lee, and it will also include proposals for Blackpool and Ballyvolane which are affected by tributaries of the River Lee.</p><p>  As I announced in Cork two weeks ago, the emerging preferred Scheme will be brought before the public in a Public Information day on 29th July, 2014. The full scheme and statutory documentation will then be formally placed on Public Exhibition in December 2014 and this will run over December 2014 to January 2015 when representatives of the Design team will be in attendance on advertised days to meet with the public and deal with any queries arising. The public will have a further month to make submissions on the proposals which will be considered as the scheme moves forward.    The project is overseen by a steering group consisting of officials from the OPW, the Local Authority and the design consultants for the scheme.  OPW and Cork City Council will consider how best to engage with local stakeholder groups to gather in their input, which will inform the options during the design process.</p><p>  It is intended that the completion of the detailed design and the procurement of a works contractor, along with formal Statutory Confirmation of the Scheme by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will be completed by November 2015 with the intention that works will be commenced before the end of 2015.  Pending the emergence of the preferred scheme proposals in the next few months it is not  possible to estimate how much the overall scheme will cost. However, the Government is fully committed to providing a flood relief scheme for Cork City as soon as possible, and to providing the necessary funding for this.</p></reply>

I am aware that the issue of obtaining insurance cover continues to cause great difficulty to people in certain locations.  Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case by case basis but, where flood defence investments have been made and the standard of protection can be verified, I see no reason why the insurance industry cannot provide flood insurance cover in these communities.</p></reply>

The Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are both making changes to Public Service pension schemes in order to control pension costs, including those changes noted in the recent Haddington Road Agreement.  Given the importance of maintaining a common pension scheme for these bodies on both sides of the border, I considered it appropriate that the changes being made in Northern Ireland should be reflected in the Core terms.</p><p>  This matter is the subject of ongoing negotiations with the relevant public service unions.  I do not propose to comment further while those discussions are ongoing.</p></reply>

This additional investment supplements the exchequer capital programme and is primarily focused on projects with a high employment impact and which can benefit local economies throughout the State. It is also predicated on the use of non-traditional funding methods e.g. private financing through the PPP structure and additional Exchequer investment through reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of State assets and the new licensing arrangement for the National Lottery.</p><p>  To date, a total of &euro;1&frac12; billion in new PPP projects has been announced with a further investment of &euro;250 million to be added to the pipeline once suitable projects have been identified. On the Exchequer side, an additional &euro;150m investment in schools, energy efficiency and roads projects was committed followed by the more recent announcement in relation to the use of &euro;200m additional investment from the Lottery Licence transaction.  Some &euro;45m will also be invested this year from part of the proceeds of the asset disposal programme to meet essential upfront costs associated with the new PPP projects.   This includes substantial enabling works at the Grangegorman DIT project which are well underway.</p><p>  As I announced on Budget day, a review of the public capital programme will be undertaken by my Department this year and will culminate in the setting of the Government's capital investment framework for the period ahead. It is my intention that the use of further proceeds arising from the sale of assets will be considered as part of the review, taking account of the infrastructure investment priorities identified in the review.  The review will also examine the scope for the utilisation of other non-traditional funding sources to augment investment in employment intensive projects that can promote economic growth and best meet our infrastructure needs.</p></reply>

The Study examined the causes and impacts of flooding in the area from Portmarnock on the northern side of the City to Booterstown on the Southern side.</p><p>  The main aims of the Study were to:</p><p>- Undertake a strategic examination of the risk to Dublin and Fingal from coastal flooding</p><p>- Identify appropriate strategies and policies to combat and manage that risk</p><p>- Identify options to reduce and/or manage the risk and to identify any capital funding required to deliver on the recommended strategy</p><p>- Specify an early warning system for coastal flooding.</p><p>  Some of the recommendations have since been carried out by Dublin City Council with funding from the OPW, including the flood relief works on the River Tolka and Spencer Dock. Significant works have also been undertaken on the River Dodder with the tidal section now almost completed and further works underway in the area up to Ballsbridge.  It is also understood that the City Council intend to commence flood defence works on the South Campshires on the River Liffey later this year.</p><p>  The City Council has also undertaken some works in the Sandymount area with longer term works to be investigated later this year. It is understood that works are also to be carried out near the Bull Island Causeway later in 2014.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Dublin City Council developed a flood relief scheme for Clontarf but it was rejected by the public. It is understood that discussions are ongoing with local residents and businesses before new proposals can be developed.

It is worth noting that Dublin City recorded its highest tide ever on 3<sup>rd</sup> January 2014 and had very minimal damages, as a result of works undertaken,  compared to a similar tide in February 2002 which flooded over 1250 buildings and caused over &euro;60 million in damages.</p></reply>

The EU Thresholds for the relevant years are listed as follows.</p><p>  The main advertising thresholds in effect from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009 were as follows:<table><tr><th>Works</th><th> Threshold</th><th> Public Bodies</th></tr><tr><td>Contract Notice</td><td>&euro;5,150,000</td><td>Government Departments and Offices, Local and Regional Authorities and other public bodies.</td></tr><tr><td>Supplies and Services<br /><br /><br /> </td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Contract Notice</td><td>&euro;133,000</td><td>Government Departments and Offices</td></tr><tr><td>Contract Notice</td><td>&euro;206,000</td><td>Local and Regional Authorities and public bodies outside the Utilities sector.</td></tr><tr><td>Utilities</td><td>- </td><td>- </td></tr><tr><td>Works Contracts / Prior Indicative Notice</td><td>&euro;5,150,000</td><td>Entities in Utilities sectors covered by GPA</td></tr><tr><td>Supplies and Services</td><td>&euro;412,000</td><td>Entities in Utilities sectors covered by GPA</td></tr></table>  The main advertising thresholds in effect from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011 were as follows:<table><tr><th>Works</th><th> Threshold</th><th> Public Bodies</th></tr><tr><td>Contract Notice</td><td>&euro;4,845,000</td><td>Government Departments and Offices, Local and Regional Authorities and other public bodies.</td></tr><tr><td>Supplies and Services<br /><br /><br /> </td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Contract Notice</td><td>&euro;125,000</td><td>Government Departments and Offices</td></tr><tr><td>Contract Notice</td><td>&euro;193,000</td><td>Local and Regional Authorities and public bodies outside the Utilities sector.</td></tr><tr><td>Utilities</td><td>- </td><td>- </td></tr><tr><td>Works Contracts / Prior Indicative Notice</td><td>&euro;4,845,000</td><td>Entities in Utilities sectors covered by GPA</td></tr><tr><td>Supplies and Services</td><td> &euro; 387,000</td><td>Entities in Utilities sectors covered by GPA</td></tr></table>  For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website    or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers. Data relating to contracts awarded below EU thresholds would be held by relevant contracting authorities. The following information is based on data available on above EU threshold awards only:</p><p>- In 2008 296 Contracts valued at &euro;568M of the total known awarded contract above threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies.</p><p>- In 2009, 172 Contracts valued at &euro;753M of the total known awarded contract above threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies.</p><p>- In 2010, 115 Contracts valued at &euro;293M of the total known awarded contract above threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies.</p><p>- In 2011, 123 Contracts valued at &euro;240M of the total known awarded contract above threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies.</p><p>  In 2011, the public procurement awards that went to non-domestic companies represented less than 5% of the overall annual public procurement spend (approximately &euro;13.1 billion). The main centres of origin of companies that have been awarded public procurement contracts above the EU threshold in 2011 are:<table><tr><th>Country/Region</th><th>No. of Contracts</th></tr><tr><td>Northern Ireland</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>EU Other</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Non-EU (US, UAE etc..)</td><td>18</td></tr></table>  Data 2012 and 2013 will be available later this year. I should point out that the Public Service Reform Plan published by my Department includes a recommendation to improve performance measurement and procurement expenditure analysis. In this regard, a key focus of the Office of Government Procurement will be a move towards centralisation of data collection in the area of procurement activity. The centralisation of data collection will not only enable the Office to procure in a more cost efficient manner but will also capture more informative data on SME participation.</p><p>  It is important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the open market regime also offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

There have been some unexpected issues on the industry side requiring finalisation but I am confident that, in the coming weeks, I will be in a position to make an announcement on an agreed Memorandum of Understanding  between the industry and the OPW. </p><p>  The OPW has to date provided information on 12 completed flood relief schemes in an agreed format to Insurance Ireland and I expect to see that, in these protected areas, the insurance industry recognises this significant capital investment on behalf of the taxpayer, and insures properties benefiting from that investment. </p><p>  It is important, nevertheless, to state that the OPW has no role or function in relation to the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry or of insurance matters generally. I am aware that the issue of obtaining insurance cover continues to cause great difficulty to people in certain locations.  Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case by case basis but, where flood defence investments have been made and the standard of protection can be verified , I see no reason why the insurance industry cannot provide flood insurance cover in these communities.  </p></reply>

The Acts contain a number of time limits regarding the making of a claim for unfair dismissal.</p><p>  Section 8 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, as amended, provides that an employee may bring a claim for unfair dismissal against an employer before a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Section 8 also provides that the claim for redress is initiated by giving the required noticed in writing to a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, specifically &ldquo;(a) within the period of 6 months beginning on the date of the relevant dismissal, or (b) if the rights commissioner or the Tribunal, as the case may be, is satisfied that exceptional circumstances prevented the giving of the notice within the period aforesaid, then, within such period not exceeding 12 months from the date aforesaid as the rights commissioner or the Tribunal, as the case may be, considers reasonable,&rdquo;.</p><p>  With regard to an appeal of a Recommendation of a Rights Commissioner to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, section 9 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 provides that this may be initiated by either the employer or the employee within 6 weeks of the date on which the Rights Commissioner&rsquo;s Recommendation was given to the parties.</p><p>  With regard to an appeal of a Determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to the Circuit Court, section 11 of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 provides that a party concerned may appeal to the Circuit Court from a Determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in relation to a claim for redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts within 6 weeks from the date on which the determination was communicated to the parties.</p><p>  With regard to a failure by an employer to carry out a Recommendation of a Rights Commissioner in relation to a claim for redress under the Unfair Dismissal Acts, section 8 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 contains the following provision: &ldquo;Where a recommendation of a rights commissioner in relation to a claim for redress under this Act has not been carried out by the employer concerned in accordance with its terms, the time for bringing an appeal against the recommendation has expired and no such appeal has been brought, the employee concerned may bring the claim before the Tribunal and the Tribunal shall, notwithstanding subsection (5) of this section, without hearing the employer concerned or any evidence (other than in relation to the matters aforesaid), make a determination to the like effect as the recommendation.&rdquo;</p><p>  With regard to the a failure by an employer to carry out the terms of a Determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in relation to a claim for redress under the Unfair Dismissal Acts, section 11(3)(a) of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 contains the following provision: </p><p>&ldquo;If an employer fails to carry out in accordance with its terms a determination of the Tribunal in relation to a claim for redress under the Principal Act within 6 weeks from the date on which the determination is communicated to the parties, the Circuit Court shall, on application to it in that behalf by -</p><p>(i) the employee concerned, or</p><p>(ii) if he considers it appropriate to make the application having regard to all the circumstances, the Minister, without hearing the employer or any evidence (other than in relation to the matters aforesaid) make -</p><p>(I) an order directing the employer to carry out the determination in accordance with its terms, or</p><p>(II) if the determination directed the re-instatement or re-engagement of the employee concerned and that Court considers it appropriate to do so having regard to all the circumstances, in lieu of making an order under subparagraph (I), make an order directing the employer, in lieu of re-instating or re-engaging the employee, to pay compensation to him under section 7 (1) (c) of the Principal Act and giving such directions for the enforcement of the latter order as it considers appropriate having regard to all the circumstances.&rdquo;</p><p>  Finally, Section 11(6)(a) of the Statute of Limitations Act 1957 provides that the statute of limitations period in respect of the enforcement of a Circuit Court order is twelve years from the date on which the judgment became enforceable.</p></reply>

IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base.</p><p>  When marketing Kerry for new inward investment IDA Ireland particularly focuses on the ICT (incl. software), International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sector.  On 4 June last, MYMIC Global announced that twenty two jobs would be created in Valentia over the next three years.  In addition there will be a further 15 jobs in the construction phase.  The jobs announcement was made in conjunction with IDA Ireland, Kerry County Enterprise Board and the Valentia Island Development Company.</p><p>  There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid.</p><p>  I am determined to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment and I am concerned about the lack of investment in certain regional locations.  I have, accordingly, requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations. This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken. This analysis, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, the changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that will be introduced in 2014 and our approach to regional development will inform the formulation of an appropriate FDI strategy from 2015 onwards.</p></reply>

This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the European Union.  All such grants come from the exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding. </p><p>  The guidelines for 2014 to 2020 were adopted by the Commission on 19 June 2013, and will enter into force on 1 July 2014. As a result, changes to Regional Aid grant rules will not be possible until 2021. </p><p>As things stand<b>,</b> Kerry qualifies for regional investment aid for SME&rsquo;s under the current 2007-2013 Regional Aid Map, at a rate of 20% for medium sized companies (50 to 249 employees) and 30% for small companies (under 50 employees). Since January 2009<b>,</b>   Kerry no longer qualifies for regional aid for investment projects by large companies.  </p><p>  For the 2014-2020 Irish Regional Aid Map, economic data such as unemployment and Gross Domestic Product for all counties, including Kerry, will once again be analysed afresh when deciding which counties will be designated for Regional Aid. </p><p>  If Kerry, or any other Irish region, was to be designated, aid to all categories of companies would be allowed.  The rates for SME&rsquo;s would be the same as those that apply in 2007-2013.  The rates for investment by large companies would be 10% for certain activities only. </p><p>  My officials are currently compiling the most up to date economic data for each county in order to determine which counties will qualify for inclusion in a revised Regional Aid Map for Ireland. Once this data has been compiled and analysed, qualifying regions up to a maximum of 51.28% of the total population will be included in the new map. This must be agreed by Government and submitted to the European Commission by the end of June, 2014. </p><p>  It is important to note that all of the Country, including those areas not entitled to Regional Aid, can qualify for other forms of State investment e.g. Research &amp;amp; Development Aid, SME Investment Aid, Training Aid, and Aid for Environmental protection etc.</p></reply>

The Equality Tribunal has jurisdiction to investigate and decide upon complaints of discrimination under the Employment Equality Acts, the Equal Status Acts and the Pensions Acts. The Equality Tribunal also provides a statutory mediation service.  </p><p>The Equality Tribunal is one of the front-line services directly affected by the current turbulence in the labour market. The responsibility for the Equality Tribunal was transferred from the Minister for Justice and Equality to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation<font color="#FF0000"> </font>with effect from 1 January, 2013 as part of the ongoing reform of the State's employment rights and industrial relations structures.</p><p>  I am informed that the average waiting time for a hearing of a complaint under the Employment Equality Acts is approximately 117 weeks.  However, in cases where the complainant and respondent opt for mediation, a mediation hearing is arranged within approximately twelve weeks of the initial lodgement of the complaint. </p><p>  The Equality Tribunal has recently been endeavouring to put measures in place in order to reduce the current waiting time for a hearing. These measures include increasing the individual work loads of staff and improved scheduling arrangements, training more mediators and increasing the number of venues. In addition five experienced Rights Commissioners have been trained in the area of Employment Equality legislation with a view to appointing them as temporary Equality Officers. On appointment as Equality Officers these five Rights Commissioners will be in a position to hear cases immediately and thus contribute to a substantial reduction in the current waiting time.  My Department is currently working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to obtain the necessary consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for confirmation of their appointments.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the Equality Tribunal to reduce backlogs and waiting times for hearings, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable. This is one of the reasons why I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies. </p><p>  My objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.</p><p>  A new two-tier Workplace Relations structure will be established comprising two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five (i.e. the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court). We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.</p><p>  The preparation of the legislation which will give effect to the new workplace relations structures is at an advanced stage. My intention is to publish the Workplace Relations Bill as early as possible during the Spring/Summer Dail session 2014 with a view to having the new structures in place during 2014.</p></reply>

They are either conventions, which are legally binding international treaties that may be ratified by member states, or recommendations, which serve as non-binding guidelines. Conventions often lay down the basic principles to be implemented by ratifying countries, while related recommendations supplement the conventions by providing more detailed guidelines on how they could be applied. </p><p>  Every year, the International Labour Organisation contacts its member countries, formally requesting information on the application of the various conventions that they have ratified.</p><p>  Since March 2011, Ireland responded to 48 requests from the ILO on various conventions.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-18a.703.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021800063#WRL04600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 344 and 345 together.</p><p>  The most recent regional employment data, from the Central Statistics Office shows that in the 12 months up to the end of September 2013 an additional 10,000 people were in employment in the South East region, including Waterford, and that the unemployment rate there fell by 2.8% during that period.  This is a very positive development, representing a welcome improvement in numbers at work in the region and reflects the success of Government policies, especially the Acton Plan for Jobs and various initiatives to enhance competitiveness and create a positive environment for growth and jobs.</p><p>  In the 5 year period 2009 to 2013 inclusive there have been a total of 70 IDA sponsored site visits by potential investors to Waterford.  Details of the number of site visits in each of the years in question are set out in the attached tabular statement (Table A).</p><p>  Details of the numbers of jobs gained and lost in IDA client companies in each of the years 2009 to 2013 are set out in the attached tabular statement (Table B).</p><p>I am informed by IDA that the proposed new advanced building facility, which the Agency is funding in Waterford will be 2,348sq.metres and will be located that the IDA Technology Park, at Butlerstown on the Cork Road in Waterford.  The building design has taken account of the flexibility requirement of potential end users by creating front of house open plan office area with open plan production area to the rear offers flexibility for large scale open plan use or again the potential to subdivide or introduce cellular spaces.  I understand that   the procurement process is ongoing with an expected outcome within the next month.</p><p>  I should also like to say that during 2013 there were two significant IDA Investment announcements for Waterford.  In February, Sanofi announced plans to invest &euro;44m in Genzyme&rsquo;s biotechnology campus in Waterford.  This investment will increase the site&rsquo;s diversity of products and comes on top of a &euro;150m investment a little more than a year previously.  The investment ensures that the Waterford facility, which currently employs approximately 500 people, can produce the company&rsquo;s latest products and provides an indication of the Waterford site&rsquo;s value to the company.  In March, Nypro Healthcare announced plans to establish an additional state of the art medical devices facility in Waterford.  This will result in the creation of over 200 new high quality jobs in the coming years.</p><p><b>TABLE A</b></p><p><b>Table showing the number of IDA sponsored site visits by potential investors to Waterford in each of the years 2009 to 2013, inclusive </b><table><tr><th>County</th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2013</div></th></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>TABLE B </b></p><p><b>Table showing the number of jobs gained and lost in IDA Ireland client companies in each of the years 2009 to 2013, inclusive </b><table><tr><th>County</th><th></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2013</div></th></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>New Jobs Created (Gross Gains)</td><td><div>166</div></td><td><div>246</div></td><td><div>144</div></td><td><div>117</div></td><td><div>172</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>Gross Losses</td><td><div>-635</div></td><td><div>-455</div></td><td><div>-1,066</div></td><td><div>-284</div></td><td><div>-120</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

As regards jobs created, the only figures available to my Department are those in respect of jobs created, on a county basis, in client companies of the Enterprise Development Agencies under the aegis of my Department.  </p><p>  Table 1, accompanying this reply, provides details of jobs created, since 2009 in companies in Co. Waterford that were supported by Enterprise Ireland (EI) and IDA Ireland and, from 2010 onwards, in the case of companies supported by Waterford County and City Enterprise Boards .</p><p>  It should be noted that the data in the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey, which is the active time series and the source for the data relating to EI and IDA-supported companies, can change year-on-year.  For example, companies that enter the population or have transferred agency, have the opportunity to revisit numbers for the previous year when they are completing the Survey.  As these figures are compiled on an annualised basis, the figures for 2013 are expected to be published in April 2014.</p><p>  Details of companies in Co. Waterford in receipt of payments from Enterprise Ireland for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set out in Table 2 accompanying this reply.  The information on company payments relating to 2013 is prepared as part of the process for the finalisation of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts.  These audited figures will be made available on publication, later this year, in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Annual Report 2013. </p><p>  Details of companies in receipt of payments from IDA Ireland for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set out in Table 3 accompanying this reply.  It should be noted that grants paid by IDA Ireland in a particular year are not necessarily linked to either the investments won or the jobs created in that year.  IDA Ireland does not make details of grants paid to individual companies publicly available.  Details of grants paid for 2013 should be known in July 2014. </p><p>  The information requested by the Deputy regarding company names and type of support received relates to operational matters within the County Enterprise Boards .  Details of the companies supported by Waterford City and County Enterprise Boards, including the type of support received, are published in their Annual Reports.  These Reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas once the accounts are cleared by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The details of grants paid for the period in question are not immediately available.  However, I will arrange for the information to be conveyed to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p><p>  It should also be noted that prior to 2010, the CEBs could only report on the number of jobs existing in CEB-supported companies.  In 2010, the CEBs&rsquo; data recording system was changed, thereby enabling them to produce figures for jobs existing, job gains and job losses for the years from 2010 onwards.</p><p><b>Table 1: Jobs created in companies based in Co.

The remaining land and property portfolio of Shannon Development will remain in the ownership of Shannon Development and continue to be managed by Shannon Development on the same basis as previously.</p><p>  The wider land and property assets of Shannon Development will be used as a development and promotional tool and, within Shannon Group, there can now be a greater focus on maximising the efficiency and effectiveness of the property management function.  Shannon Group will seek to maximise the use of all of Shannon Development&rsquo;s portfolio of land, industrial and building infrastructure and the network of business parks.  </p><p>  By combining a strong independent Shannon Airport with the extensive property holdings, experience and expertise of Shannon Development we will create a strong new State company which will work with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland on developing an International Aviation Services Centre in the region. I am convinced that with strong implementation we can create a world-class cluster in this region and help create the growth and jobs to drive the economy of the Shannon-Limerick area.</p><p>  The Government also decided as part of the restructuring of Shannon Development to rationalise the tourism and enterprise support agencies in the region. Shannon Development's tourism support functions have been transferred to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and its enterprise support functions have transferred to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.

In line with the public consultation procedures conducted under Section 57 of the Act of 2005, a draft of proposed regulations was published on the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s website for a period of one month in early 2012, along with a Regulatory Impact Assessment and a copy of the Directive.  Draft regulations providing for transposition of the Directive in line with the principles contained in the Act of 2005 were subsequently transmitted by my Department to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) at the end of 2012. </p><p>  However, legal advice received from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) in early 2013 required a reversal of this approach, as concerns were raised about the suitability of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, as a vehicle for transposing this Directive.  My Department was subsequently advised that transposition should instead be effected using the Ministerial regulation making powers contained in section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972.  </p><p>  Officials from my Department and the Health and Safety Authority have been working together with the OPC on the framing of draft regulations, so as to expedite the transposition arrangements in a manner that is true to the spirit of the Directive, while also ensuring appropriate and proportionate enforcement measures attuned to our existing national regulatory framework.  The European Commission has been informed in the meantime of the legal issues that have given rise to the delayed transposition. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the delay in the transposition of the Sharps directive, the Health and Safety Authority has produced a very clear guidance document, available on their website since last year, that outlines the procedures that must be followed in order to comply with the provisions of the Directive.  The requirements of the Directive have been brought to the attention of the healthcare sector, throughout the transposition period and since the date on which the Directive came into effect, in communications and presentations made by the HSA presentations at seminars including events held by the Institute of Occupational Health and Safety, Nursing Homes Ireland and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The HSA has also communicated on the &lsquo;Sharps Directive&rsquo; and its implementation at different times with a number of other interested parties in the healthcare sector, including those involved in the dental profession and HSE Office of Health Protection.</p><p>  The transposition deadline for this Directive was 11 May 2013.  On 23 January 2014 the EU Commission issued a Letter of Formal Notice of Infringement against Ireland (Ref. 2013-0274) requesting Ireland to submit a response within two months i.e. by 21 March 2014.  It is anticipated that the transposing measures will be submitted before that deadline and that any escalation of the infringement proceedings would accordingly be averted.</p></reply>

The scheme, which is means tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.  Humanitarian assistance does not include risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses. </p><p>  In dealing with events of this nature the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows: </p><p>-   Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments for food, clothing, personal items and temporary accommodation in the immediate aftermath of the event. A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially but this will increase as the extent of the problems become clearer. </p><p>-   Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items. It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known. </p><p>-   Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required. It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental/Agency response. Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting. </p><p>  Following the June 2012 flooding, approximately 120 payments were made to affected householders in the Cork area to the value of some &euro;150,000.  Of these, 27 payments totalling &euro;16,000 were made to persons living in the Blackpool area.  There were no payments made in respect of tenants of Douglas Village Shopping Centre as the humanitarian assistance scheme does not cover business or commercial losses.</p><p>  Any person experiencing hardship as a result of the severe weather conditions, should contact the Department&rsquo;s local representative administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme who may be able to offer assistance.</p></reply>

Some 425 not-for-profit companies and co-operatives shared annual funding of &euro;46m from the programme in 2013.  Contract holders must deliver tangible services that are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising and other public funds.  The programme is not intended to represent full-funding for any operation.</p><p>  Each contract holder is responsible for their own budgets, income, financial and other liabilities.  Contracts are generally offered on a three-year cycle based on a business plan or similar submitted by the company.  Continued funding is subject to satisfactory compliance with the programme&rsquo;s operational requirements, financial position of the company, continued eligibility of the company and service, progress on delivery of the stated objectives in the business plan, and an assessment of a business plan for the following three year contact cycle.  A regular review process is undertaken to ensure compliance with contract obligations, audit issues, continuing capacity of the organisation to manage public funds, the need for and quality of service delivery, sustainability, and value for money.</p><p>  A re-contracting process for the period 2014-16 for organisations operating under the Community Services Strand of the programme was undertaken in 2013.  This involved the submission of business plans by contracted organisations.  These business plans and past performance were reviewed by Pobal and the conclusions submitted to the Department for consideration and decision.  The business plan and operations of the company referred to by the Deputy was reviewed under this process.  The company in question was approved for a funding contribution for one full time manager post and eight full-time equivalent posts (FTE) plus &euro;25,000 operational funding per annum up to end of 2013 with a total value of &euro;209,264 pa.  The business plan submitted by the company as part of the 2014-16 review process was considered to have limitations including the demonstrated level of activity for the level of funds granted.  The level of output delivered by the company was considered low when compared with similar services.  While the continued need for programme support was recognised, both Pobal and the Department are concerned about the value for money being delivered for the high level of public funds provided to the company.  In particular, the level of output delivered by the company was less than that delivered by similar operations.  </p><p>  The programme&rsquo;s contribution to the company&rsquo;s turnover has increased in recent years and is significantly above the level generally accepted for companies supported by the programme.  In light of these conclusions, approval for a reduced level of funding was given.  The phased reduction in funding over 2014 to 2016 will ensure value for money is delivered and should stimulate the company into diversifying its income sources and increase productivity to underpin its ongoing sustainability and decrease its dependence on CSP funding to more satisfactory levels.  The company has been offered an opportunity to seek a review of the decisions made.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 79,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  The Department completed a review of the maximum rent limits which came into effect on 17 June 2013 and will remain in place until 31 December 2014.  The emphasis of the review was to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market.  The current maximum rent limits are prescribed on a county basis with Dublin divided into Fingal and non-Fingal areas.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments including the household benefits package. </p><p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients. </p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers and particularly those who are living alone. In Budget 2014, I was able to maintain the rate of the living alone allowance at &euro;7.70 per week.  While the decision to the telephone allowance was a difficult one it allowed my Department to maintain at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, such as the free electricity/gas allowance and the free television licence.  These are very valuable supports for customers. We have also maintained the value of the fuel allowance and free travel. </p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full.  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer.  The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. </p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.  There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014.</p></reply>

As a result of budget changes introduced in 2013, the practice of uprating those on means reduced payments to the maximum personal rate on back to education allowance (BTEA) was discontinued from 1st January, 2013.  From that date, new entrants to the BTEA scheme aged over 25 years will get their existing social welfare rate entitlement only. </p><p>  In the case of the above named, an incorrect decision was made on the rate of BTEA payable in respect of the persons in question when they commenced full-time study.  Both customers were awarded the maximum rate of &euro;188 instead of a reduced rate of BTEA, due to household means.  To ensure a consistent approach, the rate of BTEA was corrected.  The weekly rate of BTEA has therefore been revised to reflect the customers&rsquo; current household means.  It should be noted that if a customer&rsquo;s circumstances change while participating on a BTEA supported course, a revised decision should be made by the relevant Local Social Welfare Office.</p></reply>

Food poverty is a complex multidimensional issue and impacts on a range of policy areas.  There are many factors which can impact on food poverty: level of income, the cost of food, the availability of healthy food, access to food outlets and education and culture. </p><p>  There is no official measure of food poverty in Ireland.  In 2011, the Department published a technical paper on the construction of a food poverty indicator based on the analysis of food-related deprivation items in the Central Statistics Office Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), developed in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  Using this methodology, the latest (2011) figure for food poverty is 11 per cent of the population, as calculated by the ESRI. It is not possible to provide local level data on this food poverty indicator because of the sample size in SILC.  </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s primary role is to provide income supports to sustain an adequate standard of living and to prevent poverty. Welfare payments and other social transfers are very effective in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate.  Recently published ESRI research shows that welfare payments and other social transfers lifted almost 40 per cent of the population out of at-risk-of-poverty in 2011, which equates to a reduction of 71 per cent in the pre-social transfer poverty rate.  As a result, Ireland is among the best performing countries in the EU in reducing poverty through social transfers. This reflects the continuation of substantial State investment in the social protection system, despite the challenges and constraints of the economic and fiscal crisis. </p><p>  In addition, my Department administers the school meals programme as a targeted intervention for children at risk of food poverty and educational disadvantage. In 2013, the Department provided &euro;37 million for food provision to almost 205,000 children, in over 1,600 schools and organisations.  The Department also supports Healthy Food for All, a national charitable organisation, which works to improve access, availability and affordability of healthy food for low-income groups, by developing community and school food initiatives.</p></reply>

The Fund will support national schemes whereby food products and basic consumer goods are distributed to those identified as being the most deprived.  Under this regulation, Member States will be required to devise operational plans to procure supplies and support the distribution of food and consumer good using partner organisations (NGOs) and other public bodies to support these efforts.  </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has been tasked with the development of the operational programme and has been in discussion with the European Commission and other agencies in setting out the implementation arrangements.  A key priority for the Department is to ensure the administrative and associated cost burdens associated with the Fund are minimised to ensure that the indicative EU and Exchequer allocation of up to &euro;3.5m per annum is prioritised for the purchase of goods.  The programme requires certain tasks to be undertaken in the preparation of the operational programme, including consultation with interested parties and stakeholders.  The current position is that the European Commission is continuing to finalise its guidance for Members States to underpin the delivery of the programme.  Given that this Fund represent a new and innovative approach to the delivery of such support, a number of matters remain to be clarified before commitments to a particular delivery approach can be made.</p></reply>

Responsibility for delivery of this initiative rests with individual county and city councils.  Gateway has a target to provide for 3,000 placements focusing on those who have been unemployed for 24 months or more.  Potential participants are currently being selected by a random process conducted by the Department of Social Protection for recruitment by county and city councils. </p><p>  Progress on the roll-out has been slower than anticipated.  Delays in the main relate to the on-going staff restructuring processes of county and city councils, the ongoing engagement with stakeholders, particularly Trade Unions, and operational matters relating to securing resources, identifying work and supervisory cover.  So far some 1,600 work placements have been identified in councils in the initial phase of the rollout. </p><p>  To date some 61 persons have commenced working with Limerick, Fingal and Louth councils, with a further 60 expected to start work with these councils in the coming weeks.  Progress is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks across a further 10 council areas.  Despite the obstacles identified, county and city councils have given assurances of accelerating the recruitment process to fill all places identified and to meet the target of 3,000 placements.</p></reply>

Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  Typically over 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years.  People who were previously self-employed and are now in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available to other job-seeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients.</p><p>  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  </p><p>  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.   </p><p>  Further, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments, including the previously self-employed, may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.  </p><p>  The Work Placement Programme is also open to persons not in receipt of a social welfare payment, although the participant will not receive a payment while on the programme.</p></reply>

While there is no pre-determined level of replacement rate, which would influence every individual&rsquo;s decision to work, higher replacement rates may indicate lower incentives to take up employment.  In this regard a replacement rate in excess of 70% may be considered to be excessive.  </p><p>  Replacement rate analysis, as supported by research by the ESRI, demonstrates that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the Register each year. In this regard it may be noted that almost three-quarters of the people on the Live Register are only claiming a personal rate for themselves. They are either single or may have a spouse or partner who is working. In addition, 53% of the people on the Live Register receive less than the maximum personal weekly rate. </p><p>  High replacement rates are generally associated with a relatively high number of dependent children and/or receipt of rent or mortgage supplement. However, it is important to note that, as the following table demonstrates, only a very small and decreasing proportion of persons on the Live Register are in receipt of these additional supports. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Rent Supplement</th><th>Mortgage Interest Supplement</th><th>Local Authority Mortgage Allowance</th><th>% of Live Register availing of  these supports</th><th>Total Live Register </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>44,247</td><td>10,880</td><td>152</td><td>12.7%</td><td>434,784</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>39,377</td><td>8,078</td><td>90</td><td>11.2%</td><td>423,733</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>34,531</td><td>4,766</td><td>39</td><td>9.9%</td><td>395,411</td></tr></table></p><p>  Reductions in the numbers of people in receipt of housing support has been the major factor in achieving reductions in instances of high replacement rates.  In addition, changes such as basing entitlement under the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme on a five rather than a six day week and the recognition of Sunday as a day of employment under the jobseeker schemes, also having a positive effect on reducing replacement rates for some jobseeker recipients.</p><p>  In the area of housing, significant moves have been taken to address the impact of housing entitlements upon replacement rates. Arising out of commitments in the Programme for Government to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme, proposals to integrate the systems for providing rent supplement and social housing support have been advanced. It is intended to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from the Department of Social Protection (currently provided through rent supplement) to housing authorities using a new housing assistance payment.</p><p>  The effect of this transfer and the introduction of a new form of housing assistance payment will be to address one of the significant disincentives to accessing full-time employment that exists under the rent supplement scheme. This will have a further positive impact on replacement rates. </p></reply>

Data on each client&rsquo;s past occupation, and his/her education, is collected at the point of registration for job-seekers&rsquo; payment; these and other relevant data are processed and the probability of leaving the live register is calculated (PEX).  At a later stage the jobseeker is interviewed and the relevant information is updated to assist in the clients&rsquo; job search (including through collection of additional details on past work history, education, and any barriers to employability such as numeracy or literacy issues). Summary statistical information on the clients&rsquo; last held occupation as well as demographic and regional information is published on the Central Statistics Office website. </p><p>  With regard to measuring the success of activation measures the main measure used is the extent to which participants go on to take up employment or further education/training. </p><p>  In this regard, the Department has compiled a longitudinal database to track outcomes of participants on the Department&rsquo;s schemes/programmes, which can also be used to monitor outcomes for programmes operated by other Departments. The database includes information on the skillsets of participants, and provides a basis for more systematic programme evaluation. The Department has commissioned the ESRI to conduct an initial &ldquo;pathfinder&rdquo; evaluation of the Back to Education Allowance Scheme using this database. It is planned to tender for a broader econometric evaluation of activation schemes in the near future.</p><p>  In addition, an evaluation of the DSP Contact Centre service for employers is carried out every six months. Based on the results of these evaluations, measures are taken to ensure that job placement rates for Live Registrants are maximised.  </p></reply>

Help will also continue to be available for people with special or additional heating needs through the heating supplement and exceptional needs payment scheme under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p><p>  The electricity allowance has a monthly value of &euro;35 for both electricity and gas customers. The value of the allowance was protected in Budget 2014.  Electric Ireland and Bord G&aacute;is gas customers receive this amount as a credit on their bills.  Customers who have switched to other companies receive a direct monthly cash payment.</p><p>  A poverty impact assessment was carried out in late 2011 in the context of developing a range of options for the administration of the household benefits package in a de-regulated domestic energy market. The assessment focused on the potential impact of changing the electricity allowance from a unit base to a cash base to avail of cheaper rates available. It also examined the issue of the vulnerability of older people who are the main recipients of the household benefits package. </p><p>  Before January 2013, the free electricity allowance was based on Electric Ireland standard units even though it was possible to avail of cheaper rates from other companies.  The poverty impact assessment noted that there was little incentive for customers to switch to other cheaper companies.  Only 16% of social welfare customers had switched companies to avail of cheaper rates, compared to 42% nationally.  With the units based approach it was not possible for customers to carry over any saved units from Electric Ireland to other companies;  this acted as a disincentive for customers wishing to obtain better value.  Under the new cash credit system, it is now possible for a customer with Electric Ireland to transfer to other companies while maintaining their cash credit.</p><p>  Current data shows that Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners have the lowest consistent poverty rate and as a group compared to the rest of the population are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension and other benefits.  Between 2004 and 2011, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.9% to 1.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group also fell, from 27.1% to 16% over the same period.</p></reply>

This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. The purpose of T&uacute;s is the provision of quality work for those who are unemployed in order to break the cycle of unemployment and to improve a person&rsquo;s opportunities in returning to the labour market.

When a death occurs it is registered on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner.

Section 28 (7) of the Act provides that, if a coroner ascertains that a body is that of a stillborn child, he or she shall notify a registrar in the functional area of the authority in which the body is located of the stillbirth and shall give to the registrar, in as far as he or she can ascertain them, the required particulars in relation to the stillbirth, and the registrar shall register the stillbirth in such manner as an tArd-Chlaraitheoir may direct. </p><p>  It is not intended to amend the Civil Registration Act, 2004 to allow for the registration of deaths without a medical certificate or a coroner&rsquo;s certificate stating the cause of death.</p></reply>

CIB is working closely with the three Donegal based MABS companies to address client demand in North Donegal with a view to re-balancing of clients attending each of the services, particularly in the light of very low demand in Donegal South and West. </p><p>  In addition, staff have been redeployed from outreach services to the main Letterkenny office, the full approved staffing level has been restored following a long term absence and provision for additional capacity has recently been made.  </p><p>  MABS operate an appointment scheduling system and this means that in some cases clients may have to wait a number of weeks for the next available appointment. While waiting for an appointment, clients can use MABS free self-help materials to take holding action and to begin the process of assessing their situation.  The MABS Helpline can also support clients while they are awaiting their first appointment with a MABS money adviser.</p><p>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service is made up of a network of 53 companies which includes 51 local companies and 2 national companies, MABS ndl and National Traveller MABS.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at .  In 2014 funding of some &euro;18.6   million has been provided to MABS.</p><p>The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has responsibility for MABS, compiles information on the waiting times in each MABS office on a quarterly basis and posts it to the    website.  The most recent statistics available, compiled to end of December 2013, record that the average waiting time from first point of contact to first appointment with a money adviser is some 4.5 weeks. This is a national average and can are vary greatly between offices.  Details are provided by county / office area in the table below.</p><p>  Sixty percent of MABS services (31 out of 51) have waiting times of 4 weeks or less and three quarters of services (39 out of 51) have waiting times of 6 weeks or less. 12 MABS services have longer waiting times.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the ongoing monitoring of MABS services and the deployment of available resources to meet demand will continue to contribute to the reduction of waiting times across the MABS network of offices.</p><p><b>MABS Client Waiting Times &amp;amp; Numbers at 31 December 2013</b><table><tr><th>Company</th><th>Contact Phone </th><th>Waiting  time  - Average Weeks</th><th>Number awaiting first appointment</th></tr><tr><td>Arklow &amp;amp; District</td><td>0761 07 2390</td><td>2.4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>0761 07 2400</td><td>1.6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymun</td><td>0761 07 2150</td><td>4.2</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>0761 07 2330</td><td>9.4</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>Bray</td><td>0761 07 2250</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>0761 07 2070</td><td>0.6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>0761 07 2410</td><td>3.4</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Charleville</td><td>0761 07 2420</td><td>8.8</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>0761 07 2430 Ennis<br /><br />0761 07 2790 Shannon</td><td>2.2</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>0761 07 2270</td><td>3.8</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>0761 07 2090</td><td>6.4</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>0761 07 2440</td><td>4.0</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>0761 07 2450 Dunmanway</td><td>1.6</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal North</td><td>0761 07 2460<br /><br />0761 07 2470 Inishowen</td><td>26.2</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal South</td><td>0761 07 2480</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal West</td><td>0761 07 2650</td><td>1.6</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Drogheda</td><td>0761 07 2490</td><td>9.0</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 10 + 20 </td><td>0761 07 2110 Cherry Orchard<br /><br />0761 07 2800 Ballyfermot</td><td>2.6</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 12 Area</td><td>0761 07 2500</td><td>5.4</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North City</td><td>0761 07 2510</td><td>7.8</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North East</td><td>0761 07 2290</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East</td><td>0761 07 2520</td><td>2.8</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire</td><td>0761 07 2530</td><td>5.2</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>0761 07 2540</td><td>1.0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Dundrum/Rathfarnham</td><td>0761 07 2310</td><td>3.4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>0761 07 2550</td><td>8.2</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas Cabra</td><td>0761 07 2170</td><td>1.0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Galway North</td><td>0761 07 2560</td><td>3.8</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Galway South </td><td>0761 07 2570<br /><br />0761 07 2580 Loughrea</td><td>6.0</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>0761 07 2190</td><td>4.6</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>0761 07 2590 Kilcock<br /><br />0761 07 2600 Newbridge</td><td>4.0</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>0761 07 2610</td><td>1.8</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>0761 07 2620</td><td>1.6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>0761 07 2630</td><td>6.8</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Liffey South West</td><td>0761 07 2350</td><td>3.2</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>0761 07 2210</td><td>8.2</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>0761 07 2640</td><td>2.2</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo North</td><td>0761 07 2660</td><td>6.0</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo South</td><td>0761 07 2670</td><td>14.4</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>0761 07 2680</td><td>10.2</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>0761 07 2690</td><td>3.0</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Mullingar</td><td>0761 07 2700</td><td>1.8</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>0761 07 2710</td><td>6.0</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>0761 07 2720</td><td>7.8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>0761 07 2730</td><td>4.2</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>0761 07 2370</td><td>3.8</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary North </td><td>0761 07 2740 Thurles<br /><br />0761 07 2760 Nenagh</td><td>2.6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary South </td><td>0761 07 2130<br /><br />0761 07 2750 Clonmel</td><td>2.0</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>0761 07 2050 Waterford</td><td>0.8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford West</td><td>0761 07 2770 Waterford West</td><td>0.4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>0761 07 2780 Wexford</td><td>1.2</td><td>4 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Both are included in a list of species protected under the EU Habitats Directive.  Consequently, Ireland is obliged to monitor and report on their status, including in relation to their population, every six years.   The most recent six year report submitted to the European Commission in June 2013 is available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at .      Management of seal populations will also require careful consideration of recently published studies from Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute concerning seal depradation (fish eaten by seals during fisheries operations) and bycatch of seals in set nets.    I understand further work is underway to enhance our understanding of this complex area.  The assessment of risk from inshore sea fisheries in relation to the Natura 2000 network by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Marine Institute later in 2014 will also need to carefully consider seal-fisheries interactions. All these studies will continue to inform policy in relation to seal protection.</p><p>  While seals are protected under the Wildlife Acts, licences may be obtained under section 42 of the Wildlife Act to hunt seals where damage is being caused.    Licences are issued in response to specific applications and each application is considered on its merits. This redress is available to individual fishermen to control damage to fisheries by seals at particular locations. </p></reply>

It was originally targeted at students with little or no Irish to enable them to follow the curriculum in Gaeltacht schools. My Department pays a grant to the organisations that administer the scheme at local level in the various Gaeltacht regions. An amount of &euro;724,275 has been sanctioned for the current school year and a total of 85 language assistants are employed on a part-time basis under the scheme. Their duties now also include enriching the vocabulary of those students whose home language is Irish.   Since the 2011/12 school year, I have sanctioned an increased allocation of &euro;150,000 under the scheme which helps to provide extra contact hours as well as facilitating other improvements in the scheme. This extra allocation further supports the substantial number of Gaeltacht schoolchildren who benefit from the scheme. </p><p>  While the operation of the scheme is reviewed on a regular basis, there are no plans at present to extend its scope. The Deputy will be aware that Gaelscoileanna is the national, voluntary organisation that provides advice and support for the development of Irish-medium schools at primary and at post-primary level. The organisation is funded by Foras na Gaeilge and has recently been selected as the lead organisation to be responsible for Irish-medium/immersion education and Irish-medium preschool education on an all-island basis as part of Foras na Gaeilge&rsquo;s new funding arrangements for Irish language organisations.</p></reply>

A report on the hull condition of the vessel, commissioned by INT in April 2013, highlighted serious safety concerns. Based on the report&rsquo;s findings, INT issued a &lsquo;Notice to Vacate&rsquo; to both of the businesses that had been operating from the vessel. </p><p>  The Deputies will also be aware that Waterways Ireland, given the health and safety concerns arising from the condition of the vessel, offered, as the property owners of the Grand Canal Dock, to arrange for the removal and disposal of the ship on INT's behalf.  I am advised that INT accepted the offer and confirmed its approval to Waterways Ireland to dispose of the vessel on its behalf on the ground of the health and safety risks arising. </p><p>Unfortunately, the position is that the Naomh &Eacute;anna has deteriorated substantially in the past 20 years and presents a real risk in the Grand Canal Basin. I understand that significant investment would be required to bring the vessel to the point where it would be safe and insurable. Accordingly, to mitigate the risks, Waterways Ireland proposes to move the Naomh &Eacute;anna to an adjacent dry dock, under a short-term licence agreement with NAMA, from where it will be dismantled under contract. The vessel&rsquo;s condition will not support its movement out of the Dock and I am advised by Waterways Ireland that this is the only practical way of ensuring the vessel does not sink in the main Dock, thereby giving rise to considerable additional expense. I am also advised that extensive works, entailing considerable additional costs, would be required to preserve the   already unstable hull of the vessel.  </p><p>Deputies will recall that a commitment was given in this House last Thursday that a meeting would be convened of the accountable bodies in this area, including my own Department, Waterways Ireland and other relevant bodies, to determine if anything can be done to avert the disposal of the Naomh &Eacute;anna at this time. I wish to inform the House that meeting took place but concluded that the proper course of action to be taken now is to proceed with the disposal of the vessel. This will now be done. Accordingly, I am advised that it is not feasible to   allow an opportunity for 16 weeks or six months as proposed for any interested group to provide a plan that would attract investment in the vessel's restoration.</p><p>This decision has not been taken lightly. Rather, it is because of   the continuing serious risk posed by the vessel, the disruption and expense that would be involved were it to sink in the Grand Canal Dock and the very considerable expense that would be involved in making it safe and insurable.</p></reply>

My decision on the consent application provided, inter alia, for the full repair and restoration of the monument buildings and the creation of a commemorative centre to honour the leaders of the 1916 Rising.</p><p>  My Department has recently received confirmation from the National Asset Management Agency that it has approved funding for works covered by the consent I have given under the National Monuments Acts, subject to compliance with all statutory processes. The arrangements for the disbursement of the NAMA funding are a matter for the Agency itself. </p><p>  The national monument is in private ownership and, accordingly, the advancement of proposals that reflect the terms of the consent I have granted is a matter for the owners.  The consent is, however, conditional on a revised project design that takes full account of the terms of my decision being submitted for my approval within 9 months of the decision date.  A further condition requires substantive works to commence on site within 3 months of the approval of the revised proposals.  </p><p>  There have been a number of meetings between my Department and the monument owners in the meantime to discuss and clarify various aspects of the 52 detailed conditions set out in the consent order with the intention of ensuring that the designs for the approved works are fully compliant with what I have prescribed.  There have also been discussions in relation to the site investigations needed to determine the works that will be necessary to stabilise and underpin the monument buildings.  As part of these investigations, the cellars under the yards to the rear of monument buildings, which I understand were in use until relatively recently, have been re-opened and are currently being cleared out.  </p><p>  My understanding is that the completed designs for the approved works will be submitted to me in the near future to verify that they are in compliance with the consent order.  They will be assessed as quickly as possible on receipt to establish whether they conform to the terms of my decision on the consent application.  The consultation procedures prescribed under the National Monuments Acts have already been completed in this case as part of the processing of the consent application and related Environmental Impact Assessment.  No.18 Moore Street is outside the bounds of the Preservation Order in this case and my role in relation to that building is confined to ensuring that any works to it do not adversely impact on the adjacent national monument.   </p><p>  As the national monument is not in the ownership of the State, the practical arrangements for the proposed survey of the national monument buildings by the 1916 relatives&rsquo; representative group, which the monument owners have agreed to in principle, are matters for the group and the owners to agree.  The arrangements for the management of the buildings once work is completed is primarily a matter for the owners.</p></reply>

The IFB has primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions. It is a statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry and I have no responsibility in relation to its day-to-day operational matters, including the allocation of resources to different support programmes and schemes.   Following consultations between my Department, the IFB and the Department of Finance, a number of changes to section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Film Tax Relief Scheme) are being introduced to ensure that Ireland retains or regains competitiveness in attracting foreign film projects to Ireland. The scheme was extended to the end of 2020 in the 2013 Finance Act and further changes were announced by the Minister for Finance in his 2014 budget speech.  The budget announcement brings forward the new regime for film tax reliefs to 2015, and extends the definition of 'eligible individual' in the scheme for film relief to include non-EU talent. I am confident that this will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allow the audiovisual production sector to maintain existing jobs and create new ones.</p></reply>

Designations of this nature do not mean there is a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; prohibition on further development or activities within these sites.

The 1987 Act sets out the statutory provisions in relation to the general use of metal detectors to search for archaeological objects on any lands and the particular requirements applying to their use or possession on protected monuments and archaeological sites.     My Department, in co-operation with the National Museum of Ireland, has recently published guidelines setting out advice to the public on use of detection devices and their impact on our archaeological heritage. The guidelines are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and are also being made available in museums, libraries, local authority offices, etc.  The guidelines explain both the provisions of the relevant legislation and the reasons why it was enacted in 1987. </p><p>  It is important to note that the 1987 Act does not prohibit outright the use of metal detectors for archaeological purposes, rather it ensures that such use takes place in a regulated manner, subject to appropriate safeguards. I am satisfied that the current regulatory provisions are reasonable and proportionate.</p></reply>

Prior to designation, land owners were given an opportunity to appeal the inclusion of their lands within the sites through a two stage process,which included an independent Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board. Many land-owners availed of that opportunity.  Under current legislation, once the designation is made by the Minister there is no mechanism to revisit its status, save for the loss of the scientific justification for its designation.    In the context of addressing infringement action brought against Ireland for breaches of EU law in the regulation of designated bogs, my Department has recently undertaken a review of raised bog NHAs. The review has proposed a reconfiguration of the network of raised bog NHAs, including the complete or partial de-designation of 46 exiting NHAs and the designation of new sites to ensure that the conservation value of the network is enhanced, while significantly reducing economic and social impacts arising from the displacement of active turf-cutters. Land-owners in any newly proposed NHA will be given an opportunity to appeal the inclusion of their land within the boundaries of the site.</p><p>  It will be necessary to introduce legislative change to allow for the de-designation of NHAs as part of the NHA review. The preparation of legislative proposals is currently underway and will be brought forward as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Tsunami-generating earthquakes have occurred in the wider north Atlantic region and hazard assessments by the Geological Survey of Ireland indicate that there is a small threat to Ireland from such events. Tsunami threats to Ireland include; a repeat of the 1755 magnitude 8.6 Lisbon earthquake, which GSI-commissioned modelling predicts could generate waves up to 4m high on the southern Irish coastline (see    ); the seismic zone responsible for this earthquake, and a similar one in 1761 that also produced a tsunami, is a fault zone called the Azores-Gibralter fracture that continues to be active and has had a few relatively large but non-tsunamigenic earthquakes in recent years; the 1755 and 1761 tsunamis were the last authenticated tsunami impacts on the Irish coast. Other potential tsunami generating events would include earthquakes along the Caribbean plate margin, submarine landslides and volcanic activity in the Canaries. To date modelled wave sizes for Ireland are less than those predicted in 100 year flood mapping and considerably less than those that recently occurred due to Atlantic storms.</p><p>  The international nature of ocean waters dictate that a co-operative international approach is the most appropriate response to the development of early warning systems and efforts in this regard are being coordinated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in the case of the North East Atlantic and Mediterranean. This international effort is currently being led by partners in France, involving partners throughout the Atlantic region and is expected to take some time. My Department is coordinating the engagement of national partners in this project and Ireland contributes seismic and sea level data to that system and participates in communications exercises in preparation for assimilation of tsunami warning into the national emergency management system. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-18a.1010.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021800068#WRQ01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 452, 453, 460, 475, 476 and 478 together.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been fully liberalised since 1999 in accordance with the requirements of binding EU Directives. The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. The regulation of the industry, including regulatory issues surrounding speeds, is a matter for ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg&rsquo;s website at   , as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses including those in Counties Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois and Meath. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>  -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last month, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband which is likely to include the prospect of fibre to the home services. The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market.</p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in a number of locations referred to in the Questions, including Kildare town in County Kildare, Borris in Ossory in County Laois and Dunshaughlin in County Meath before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputies concerned. </p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. In many cases, this includes follow-up queries and requests for further information. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. When this process is complete, it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country. </p><p>  In designing the procurement process for the intervention, my Department will be required to comply with the EU State aid rules which set out conditionality in relation to, among other things, technology neutrality. As different technological solutions exist to provide broadband services, no particular technology or network platform should be excluded. The EU State aid guidelines do, however, emphasise the role of fibre in assisting the delivery of high speed broadband through various platforms.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

Section 3(1) of the Act defines development to mean, except where the context otherwise requires, the carrying out of any works on, in, over or under land or the making of any material change in the use of any structures or other land.  Works involving the extraction of gravel from rivers, accordingly, require planning permission.  Furthermore, the extraction of stone, gravel, sand or clay in the case of fluvial dredging (other than maintenance dredging), where the length of river involved would be greater than 500 metres, requires an applicant for consent to furnish an environmental impact statement to the planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as the case may be.</p><p>  However, section 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain permission, subject, in many cases, to specific conditions.  Class 3, Schedule 2, Part 3 of the 2001 Planning Regulations provides that minor works relating to the construction or maintenance of any gully, drain, pond, trough, pit or widening or deepening of watercourses, the removal of obstructions from watercourses and the making or repairing of embankments in connection with any of the foregoing works is exempted development.  Development is generally not exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission if it could require an environmental impact assessment, and, since the commencement of amendments to section 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 on 21 September 2011, development is also not exempted from planning if it could require appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive.</p><p>  The Regulations are kept under review and I will consider whether any further amendments or clarifications of existing provisions are required in this area.</p></reply>

These changes were made on foot of the recommendations of a review group, established in 2013 by my Department, to examine the terms and conditions governing the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability.  Membership of the group included the County and City Managers' Association (CCMA), the Housing Practitioner Network, Local Authority personnel and my Department.  Consultations were held with organisations working with older people and people with a disability.  The aim of the review was to target the grants at those in greatest need, spreading the benefits as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in the operation of the schemes.  </p><p>  In the case of the Housing Aid for Older People (HAOP), there has been no change with regard to the range of grant-eligible works under this scheme.  Grant assistance for the replacement of sub-standard windows and doors is still available.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine the scope and extent of the works to be carried out.  While the maximum grant available under this scheme has been reduced from &euro;10,500 to &euro;8,000, it is worth noting that the average grant paid to applicants under this scheme in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was &euro;4,162, &euro;4,106 and &euro;3,995, respectively.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.</p><p>  Four regional main contractors covering eight meter regions were appointed by Irish Water following a public tendering process.  These contractors have responsibility for appointing sub-contractors who are responsible for recruiting suitably qualified staff to carry out the work.  The contractors received, as part of their contract, details of the panel of subcontractors formed by my Department.  The contractors may employ from that list, but are under no obligation to do so.  The employment of subcontractors is a matter for each regional contractor.</p><p>  Data supplied to the Department by Irish Water indicates that there were 1,060 people employed by the subcontractors at the end of January 2014.  The social inclusion commitment that forms part of the contracts for the metering programme requires that a minimum of 25% of the jobs be allocated to people on the live register, small businesses and school leavers/graduates gaining employment.  Irish Water is in the process of verifying the social inclusion targets for end January but has informed my Department that based on previous verifications it is confident that it has exceeded the social inclusion targets.</p></reply>

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law. </p><p>  Where two or more elections have the same polling day, as is the case for the forthcoming European Parliament and local elections to take place on 23 May 2014, regulations governing the taking of the polls may be made under section 165 of the Electoral Act 1992 to modify, as required, electoral legislation to enable the polls to be taken together.  As in the case of the European Parliament and local elections held in 2009, regulations to be made under section 165 of the Electoral Act 1992 in advance of the 2014 elections will provide that arrangements in relation to polling stations, including the selection of polling staff, will be a matter for the local returning officer responsible for the European Parliament elections.</p><p>  My Department routinely issues guidance to Returning Officers in advance of each election and referendum.  The guidance issued for the European Parliament and local elections being held on 23 May 2014 emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people.  Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed, particularly for the position of polling clerk where the responsibilities of the post can be fulfilled under the guidance of the Presiding Officer.</p></reply>

In that context the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland suggested at the Working Group for Engagement with Local Authority Representative Associations that each municipal district should be represented on the Corporate Policy Group (CPG).  The relevant provision in the 2014 Act was framed following engagement with the local authority representative associations regarding this proposal, which related only to representation on the CPG from the municipal districts and, accordingly, this requirement does not apply in relation to electoral areas in local authorities where the municipal district will not apply.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants in this sector.  The Act does not make provision for the Department of Social Protection to deduct payments for an award made against a social welfare recipient. </p><p>  Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.  However, while there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, this does not in any way preclude parties from pursuing enforcement independently through the courts including the seeking of a garnishee order.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities. The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.   </p><p>  My Department does not fund any service directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. Payments made by my Department under Section 10 generally equate to 90% of costs incurred by housing authorities and these authorities provide at least 10% of the cost of such services from their own resources. Housing authorities may incur additional expenditure on homeless related services which supplements funding by my Department and other agencies including the Health Service Executive.   </p><p>  While it is clear that a proportion of funding must be used to provide sufficient bed capacity to accommodate those in need of emergency accommodation it is equally important that resources are channelled to deliver more permanent responses in a more focused and strategic way. </p><p>  Details of expenditure on emergency accommodation by each of the 9 regions for the years 2009 to 2012 are presented in the table; anticipated outturn figures are provided for 2013 and the finalised figures are expected shortly. <table><tr><th>Region </th><th>2009 </th><th>2010 </th><th>2011 </th><th>2012 </th><th>2013 <br /><br />(anticipated) </th></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>&euro;24,397,869 </td><td>&euro;23,812,112 </td><td>&euro;20,637,019 </td><td>&euro;21,480,711 </td><td>&euro;23,211,421 </td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East </td><td>&euro;647,482 </td><td>&euro;706,131 </td><td>&euro;603,815 </td><td>&euro;596,284 </td><td>&euro;661,507 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>- </td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West </td><td>&euro;3,272,105 </td><td>&euro;2,709,591 </td><td>&euro;2,277,486 </td><td>&euro;2,819,672 </td><td>&euro;2,623,927 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td></td><td> --</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>Midland </td><td>&euro;620,262 </td><td>&euro;489,697 </td><td>&euro;496,310 </td><td>&euro;500,507 </td><td>&euro;484,662 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>North-East </td><td>&euro;1,254,284 </td><td>&euro;987,344 </td><td>&euro;1,010,497 </td><td>&euro;957,606 </td><td>&euro;607,462 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>North-West </td><td>&euro;170,973 </td><td>&euro;168,483 </td><td>&euro;174,608 </td><td>&euro;151,224 </td><td>&euro;137,764 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>South-East </td><td>&euro;1,331,020 </td><td>&euro;1,267,039 </td><td>&euro;1,435,474 </td><td>&euro;1,328,768 </td><td>&euro;845,267 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>South-West </td><td>&euro;2,207,807 </td><td>&euro;1,871,783 </td><td>&euro;1,535,326 </td><td>&euro;1,837,284 </td><td>&euro;1,554,756 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>West </td><td>&euro;1,022,715 </td><td>&euro;793,305 </td><td>&euro;574,106 </td><td>&euro;753,565 </td><td>&euro;610,888 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;34,924,518 </td><td>&euro;32,805,484 </td><td>&euro;28,744,640 </td><td>&euro;30,425,621 </td><td>&euro;30,737,655 </td></tr></table>  Traditionally it has been difficult to quantify the number of homeless persons on an on-going basis; this is in part a consequence of the volatility within this cohort of housing need. The Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS) was extended nationally in 2013 and is now operational nationwide. PASS will assist housing authorities to report on the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed and 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data. These reports will be published on my Department's website as soon as they are available.   In advance of the composite national data on homelessness to be available through PASS, the most complete set of data available in relation to homelessness nationally is the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland</i>, which was published on 6 September 2012. This report indicated that a total of 64 individuals were sleeping rough on Census night, 10 April 2011, while identifying a further 3,744 people as housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term. Of the total of 3,808 individuals included in the report almost 60% were in long-term or transitional housing arrangements. This report is available on CSO's website, . </p><p>  In February 2013, I published the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i> in which the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.   </p><p>The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions has submitted its first report to me. The report considered information on the homeless population, emergency and other accommodation as well as housing supply issues. I am considering this report and its recommendations and I will consult with my Government colleagues on the implementation of these recommendations, as appropriate. A copy of this report is available on my Department's website, .</p></reply>

I have increased the level of funding available for the grant schemes by 12% in 2014.  Every local authority has increased funding for grants compared to the allocations for 2013.  Offaly County Council&rsquo;s overall allocation under the grant schemes for 2014 is &euro;586,105 compared to &euro;551,663 last year.  Allocations in 2014 were determined on the basis of the level of grant activity in local authorities in 2013 and on population statistics with a weighting applied in respect of the numbers of persons aged over 65 years. </p><p>  Through careful management of my Department &rsquo;s housing budget in 2013, additional funds were made available to local authorities with high levels of grant activity, including Offaly County Council. I will be applying the same close scrutiny to the capital budget for 2014 and, in the event of savings arising, these grants will be a priority for supplementary funding.       </p><p>  In January 2014, some changes to the terms and conditions of the grant schemes were notified to local authorities. These changes are intended to spread the benefits of the schemes as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in their operation. I am aware that the grant measures are heavily subscribed across all local authority areas and my Department will be requesting authorities to prioritise those applications where the most urgent need exists.   </p></reply>

The LGMA also took on the residual functions of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, which has dissolved as of 1 November 2012. The LGMA is a central resource for the local government sector, providing, procuring and coordinating a range of support services and expertise which are most appropriately and efficiently delivered on a shared service basis at national level. </p><p>  A detailed breakdown of the annual income and expenditure for the LGMA is contained in its annual reports, the latest of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</p><p>  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA) was established in 2012. It rationalises the functions of the National Building Agency (NBA), the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) and the Centre for Housing Research (CHR). The AHP and the CHR have been closed down and the NBA ceased operating in June 2011. The HSCA was set up to work with and support local authorities, approved housing bodies and my Department in the delivery of housing and housing services.</p><p>  As published in the Revised Estimates Volume, provision of &euro;1,600,000 has been made for the HSCA for 2014, in comparison to &euro;1,704,000 in 2013. In accordance with the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (Establishment) Order 2012, the Agency&rsquo;s first accounting year will be from date of establishment to 31 December, 2013. The accounts are currently being audited and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</p><p>The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to be formed and registered under the Companies Act.  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 provided for the transfer, in part, of water services functions from 34 water services authorities to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014. The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2014 provides an amount of &euro;490 million for Irish Water from the Local Government Fund in 2014; the final outturn figure for 2014 will be slightly less at &euro;486.5 million.  This amount will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities, and met by them from their own resources and general purpose grants.   In 2014, Irish Water will also receive &euro;240 million in equity from the Minister for Finance  <i>.  </i></p><p>  The Pyrite Resolution Board was established on an administrative basis in February 2013 and was placed on a statutory footing in January 2014 following the enactment of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013.  The role of the Board is to oversee and direct the delivery of a cost effective pyrite remediation scheme for homeowners whose homes are affected by significant damage due to pyritic heave and where there are no other practicable options for redress.  The Board will work with the Housing Agency to deliver the scheme.  Using existing staff resources from my Department and the Housing Agency the Board will be able to undertake its role efficiently and without the necessity for a separate staffing structure.  </p><p>  Initial funding of &euro;10 million is being made available to my Department in 2014 to enable the remediation programme to begin and I expect that additional funding for 2014 and 2015 will be allocated later this year.  It is estimated that approximately 1,000 dwellings are currently in need of repair and the required work programme will be undertaken over a two year period.  </p></reply>

A loss in income from this source would have a negative impact on the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund, and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.  </p><p>  I have no plans to adjust the surcharge element for paying motor tax on a half-yearly or quarterly basis.</p></reply>

For example, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on the arrangements for local authority financing. In addition, under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, the Minister for Finance, from 2014 onwards, is to pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this will contribute to a range of financial supports being provided to local authorities, including General Purpose Grants and funding, on the basis of Service Level Agreements, for water services which local authorities will be providing on behalf of Irish Water. </p><p>The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. Given the significant changes to local government financing already taking place in 2014, as outlined above, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax proceeds in 2014 , particularly in terms of General Purpose Grants, with a priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. </p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p><p>  The implications of local retention of Local Property Tax, including identifying any necessary legislative requirements, are being considered in the context of preparations for the budgetary process for 2015.</p></reply>

I also refer to the outline Heads of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill which I issued in February 2013.</p><p>  The National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, which was published in December 2012, provides for the development and implementation of sectoral and local adaptation action plans which will form part of a comprehensive national response to the impacts of climate change.  The Framework provides that sectoral adaptation plans are to be made by the relevant Department or Agency and published by mid-2014.  Sectoral plans will be revised at least every 5 years.</p><p>  The spatial planning process provides the means through which climate change responses, including adaptation, will be integrated and implemented at local level.  Under the National Framework, local authorities will make an assessment of the extent to which existing development plans adequately address adaptation to climate change, for example, in respect of flood risk assessment and, where they consider it necessary and appropriate, will initiate a review process of relevant plans by mid-2014.  Local development planning will, in effect, become the mechanism for the delivery of local climate adaptation action.</p><p>  In terms of adherence to EU and international protocols on climate change, Ireland is subject to legally binding greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets, pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol in respect of the period 2008 to 2012, and a 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision (No. 406/2009/EC) in respect of the period 2013 to 2020.</p><p>  Under the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland was required to limit growth of GHG emissions to 13 per cent above 1990 levels over the period 2008 to 2012.  Under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision, which applies to GHG emissions outside the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System, Ireland must limit growth of GHG emissions to 20 per cent below 2005 levels over the period 2013 to 2020.</p><p>  Ireland is on course to confirm compliance with its target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol in the commitment period 2008 to 2012.  </p><p>  In respect of the period 2013 to 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s emission reduction target under EU law is ambitious and challenging.  I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the mitigation trajectory in the first half of the compliance period.  I will keep under review progress in terms of meeting the compliance challenge in the years 2017 to 2020, having regard to the outcome of the on-going programme for the development of national climate policy and legislation. </p></reply>

The statutory certificates must be given by the lead designer, who must be a registered construction professional prior to commencement and by the Assigned Certifier, also a registered construction professional, whose role is to prepare and implement an inspection plan during construction, so that the Assigned Certifier is in a position, in conjunction with the builder, to sign the certificate of compliance on completion.</p><p>  An extensive public consultation process was undertaken in 2012 to inform the development of the revised building control regulations which will come into effect on 1 March 2014.  Comprehensive consultation documents were published including <i>Strengthening the Building Control System - A Document to inform public consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012</i> which sets out the context in which the reforms will operate and the regulatory impact of these for building owners and industry stakeholders. This document remains available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>  In summary terms, the arrangements being put in place for the control of building activity may result in additional design, certification and, possibly, insurance costs which must ultimately be borne by the building owner.  Such additional costs would be justified by the enhanced quality and standard of design and construction of the building project concerned in light of several notable instances of non-compliant buildings which failed to meet minimum building standards.  It is anticipated that the statutory inspection process will reduce the incidences of defective works on site and the resultant associated costs of carrying out remedial works will reduce accordingly.</p></reply>

The statutory certificates of compliance must be signed by a registered professional i.e. a person who is included on the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors maintained in accordance with parts 3 and 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007 or on the register of chartered engineers established under the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969.</p><p>  Architects, Building Surveyors and Chartered Engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in regulation is entirely appropriate.  Depending on their personal circumstances it may be open to persons who are members of the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (<b>CIAT</b>), and who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers referred to which would enable a person to sign statutory certificates of compliance as provided for under the new regulations when they come into effect on and from 1 March 2014.  There is no question of persons who are not included on the statutory registers being permitted to sign certificates of compliance.</p><p>  My Department has had detailed engagement with CIAT subsequent to the public consultation on the proposed Building Control Amendment Regulations (which led to S.I. No 9 of 2014).  In this regard, my Department has outlined a number of options in keeping with the Building Control Act 2007 which could be pursued by CIAT with a view to progressing the registration of its Chartered Architectural Technologist members.  In May 2013 <b>CIAT</b> presented a case for recognition of Chartered Architectural Technologists as a route to inclusion on the register of persons entitled to use the title of Building Surveyor in accordance with Part 5 of the Building Control Act 2007, based on benchmarking the competence of Chartered Architectural Technologists against existing routes to registration as a Building Surveyor.  In June 2013 <b>CIAT</b> presented a similar case in respect of inclusion on the register of persons entitled to use the title of Architect in accordance with Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland (SCSI) and the RIAI, as the registration bodies for the relevant professions under the Act of 2007, and as the competent authorities in Ireland for the purposes of the EU Directive on the recognition of Professional Qualifications, are currently considering the cases put forward by <b>CIAT</b>.  Neither I nor my Department have any role in the assessment or validation of professional qualifications in this manner and cannot pre-empt the outcome in either case.  However, should the SCSI or the RIAI as appropriate determine that the competence of the Chartered Architectural Technologists is equivalent to the requirements for inclusion on either register, it would fall to me as Minister to bring forward relevant suitable amendments to the Building Control Act 2007.</p></reply>

The funding to be provided to local authorities for the provision of water services in 2014 is governed by Service Level Agreements between Irish Water and individual authorities.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides Irish Water with responsibility for charging customers for the provision by it of water services.</p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 also assigns responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  It is envisaged that the Commission will engage in public consultation as part of this process.  A key role for the regulator will be to protect the interests of all customers and to drive efficiencies in the water services sector.  The vast majority of household waste is collected by private waste collectors. In the very few areas where local authorities still collect waste, they do so in a market open to competition from private operators.  As waste charges represent a fee for a service provided, primarily by the private sector, their inclusion with the Local Property Tax does not arise. </p></reply>

The new regulations are necessary following the widespread instances of failure by owners, designers and builders to comply with their statutory obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 to design and construct buildings in accordance with the building regulations. Arrangements for a smooth transition to the new regulatory environment on 1 March 2014 are well in hand and my Department will continue to work with all parties to ensure they understand their obligations and the steps necessary to meet them.</p><p>  As regards the issue of third party certification, it is not clear what useful purpose would be served by imposing a requirement for independent verification of design or construction by a third party as suggested. The merits of a designer overseeing the implementation of their design cannot be overlooked. Neither is there any intention to constrain the capacity of all-in service delivery models in key sectors of the industry. Enforcement powers under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 continue to be vested in the local building control authorities and it is here that independence is called for and in place.  The RIAI are supportive of the new Regulations.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act (No. 2) 2013 provides for the transfer of water services functions from the local authorities to Irish Water.  The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.  The CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p><p>  The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Water Services (No.2) Act, 2013.  The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan.  The CER will carry out a public consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs in the coming months.  Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015.</p><p>  An inter-departmental working group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges.  The group is examining the issues arising for those with specific medical conditions, which require high water usage, in the course of its work.  The group comprises my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.  A final report will be submitted for consideration by Government when the group has completed its examination of the issues involved, and the Government will decide on the proposed approaches to be taken in relation to affordability, medical needs and the free allowance.</p><p>  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean.  Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations.  The Environmental Protection Agency is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these regulations.</p><p>  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 also requires that Irish Water will prepare codes of practice, on a range of matters, including standards in relation to the performance by Irish Water of its functions and billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided.  Irish Water will also be required to prepare a code of practice on any matter considered necessary by the CER.  I expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in fulfilling its functions.</p></reply>

There is no provision whereby motorists can come to individual payment arrangements with a licensing authority.  Any such change to the basis of payment for motor tax would be required to be underpinned by primary legislation and be made equally available to all motorists.  It would also be administratively cumbersome and potentially have a negative impact on the flow of income to the Local Government Fund and consequently on allocations to local authorities from the Fund.  I have no plans currently to introduce such a change.</p></reply>

This will enable local authorities in the areas worst affected by severe weather to help affected communities by restoring roads, coastal protection and other infrastructure and amenities.  The Government decision was based on estimated costs supplied by local authorities.  The arrangements for drawing down the funds by local authorities will be finalised following discussions between local authorities, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with the intention that it will be done as speedily as possible to enable local authorities to continue to help affected communities.  This funding is in addition to the &euro;25 million which Government has already announced for the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Humanitarian Assistance schemes and &euro;1m of this will now be channelled through the Society of St Vincent de Paul and the Irish Red Cross to assist families affected by the storms and flooding.

The majority of increments are awarded on the basis of a single point per annum, subject to relevant performance criteria being met.  Over the course of the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA), incremental progression has been further adjusted, extending the period for qualifying increments by a further 3, 6 or 12 months, depending on salary levels, and suspension of increments for 3 years for those on salary scales starting over &euro;100,000.  Full details of increments and related balancing measures are set out in Paragraphs 2.16 to 2.23 of the HRA.</p><p>  Two exceptions to the standard single point per annum incremental progression arise for Meteorologists and Statisticians in my Department.  In these cases, after an officer has completed three years&rsquo; service in the grade, the Head of the Division must review the officer&rsquo;s record of service and capability to discharge the highest duties of the grade of Meteorologist or Statistician.  As soon as the Head of the Division certifies, as a result of such review, that the officer&rsquo;s efficiency and record of service are such as to warrant extra recognition, the officer will receive advancement on the scale of three additional increments, i.e., by four increments in all.  In the case of Meteorologists the officer will be required to complete a language proficiency test in two of the following languages, French, German and Russian to enable the officer to read with ease technical publications in the corresponding languages.  There are currently 2 Statisticians and 35 Meteorologists serving in my Department to whom these particular provisions may apply.</p></reply>

It had been indicated in reported statements that the Committee intended to present a submission concerning the cause of the fire on the occasion of the recent anniversary.  Whether in that context, or at any other point, I will of course arrange for the examination as appropriate of any such submission, and for a response to issue to the Committee in due course.

Both the Commissioner and myself have been careful not to refer publically to any individual relating to that report.  It is also important to note that, having received the papers submitted by  GSOC, the Director of Public Prosecutions directed no charges against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or anyone else.  The Report by GSOC contains a series of recommendations related to informant handling procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, oversight of those procedures, as well as intelligence handling and information exchange between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  At the time I sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the Report and its recommendations.  The Garda Commissioner has pointed out the many changes which has been made to its handling of these matters  in recent years including the putting in place of a code of practice for the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources.  As such, many of the recommendations made by GSOC were already incorporated into Garda procedures, including improved training for Garda&iacute;, the development of an electronic system for maintaining records, placing emphasis on the necessity for Garda&iacute; to comply with professional standards, strict procedures for handling and disseminating intelligence as well as coordination between specialist units and robust internal auditing.  The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as   <i>agents provocateur.</i></p><p>  Although it is not referred to in the GSOC Report, I should emphasise that there has been, since 2010, an independent, external oversight mechanism in place to ensure compliance with the code of practice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the management and use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources.  The current holder of this appointment is Mr Justice Thomas Smyth, former judge of the High Court.  In addition to monitoring compliance with the code of practice, Mr. Justice Smyth&rsquo;s remit requires him to communicate any matters which he considers appropriate, including recommendations, to the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report to the Minister for Justice and Equality annually on the discharge of his functions.</p><p>  In the wider context  I have previously advised this House that following receipt of the GSOC Report I convened a meeting  with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23 July last to discuss the need for enhanced cooperation between the organisations to ensure the effective and efficient investigation of allegations of Garda misconduct.  Both the Commissioner and the Chairperson agreed on the need for the highest possible level of cooperation between the two organisations. In that regard the Garda Commissioner has established a dedicated office within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to process and monitor requests from GSOC and ensure all correspondence with GSOC is attended to in a timely manner.  In addition, revised protocols were agreed and signed by the Chairperson of the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner on the 23rd September 2013.  These revised protocols put in place clear procedures for the timely sharing of information, including sensitive information and access to PULSE, and more generally for enhanced cooperation.  These protocols will be subject to further amendments in lights of the recent agreement that the Ombudsman Commission will have direct access to the PULSE system for the penalty points investigation and any other investigation in which they are engaged.  Finally, I should mention that a committee has also been established, chaired by a senior official of my Department, with senior representatives from the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to act as a forum where any future emerging issues concerning the protocols can be identified and appropriately addressed.</p></reply>

As I have advised the Deputy previously, the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) has indicated that in the interest of confidentiality it will not be providing details or breakdowns of the numbers of applications for the various debt solutions received or being processed at this time.  The ISI has indicated that it fully intends to provide quarterly statistics once a statistically meaningful number of applications have been processed.  This is anticipated to be in the second quarter of 2014.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>The ISI has advised that it will not be publishing information in relation to the occupations of applicants for the various debt settlement solutions.</p><p>  It should be noted that the ISI does not provide advice on insolvency arrangements, this is a function of Personal Insolvency Practitioners and Approved Intermediaries and therefore the number of Garda&iacute; that may have sought advice on insolvency arrangements is unknown.  I can advise, however, that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Discipline Regulations have been updated on a number of occasions since 1923, most recently in 2007.  There is nothing in these Regulations, the Garda Code nor indeed in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which acts as a barrier to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na availing of debt resolution mechanisms contained in that Act.  The Commissioner has made it clear that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are in financial difficulties with domestic mortgage repayments in providing a home for themselves or their families will not be subjected to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations provided there is a genuine effort to deal with these financial difficulties. I fully agree with the Commissioner on this point.</p></reply>

The change will allow a relative of a child, such as a grandparent, to apply directly to court for access - this removes the current two stage process under which such a person currently has to apply for leave to make the application. This is in line with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in its 2010 report <i>Legal Aspects of Family Relationships.</i></p><p>  The Scheme also replicates the provisions requiring solicitors for an applicant or respondent to advise their clients of alternatives to court proceedings, such as mediation or counselling in an effort to come to an agreement. The Family Mediation Service can assist families in dispute in trying to develop agreed solutions.</p><p>  Proceedings should therefore arise only where the parties are in dispute and are unable or unwilling to come to an agreed solution, and my proposals are intended to simplify and streamline that process in the interests of the child and the entire family.</p></reply>

Details in respect of each category are as follows:</p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself.  The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary on the applicant's appearance in court.  Unfortunately figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown by county of the number of certificates granted for criminal legal aid.</p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>  The Legal Aid Board is a statutory, independent body in accordance with the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995. The issue raised by the Deputy is a matter for the Board.  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board.</p><p>  The Legal Aid Board operates 30 general full time law centres in 23 different counties.  The number of applicants in each of the last three years at the law centre(s) in each of the counties in which the Board has a full time presence are detailed below.  The Board has six general law centres in Dublin and two general law centres in both Cork and Galway.  In addition, the Board also operates part time law centres in the counties where it does not have a full time presence. Each of these centres is operated by a full time centre and the numbers getting services at these centres are included in the applications figure for the full time centre. I should point out that the Board operates a part-time centre in Drogheda which is operated by its law centre in Monaghan (rather than its law centre in Dundalk).</p><p>  Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputy that persons seeking legal services can apply at any law centre and are not required to apply within the county in which they reside.  Thus the figures are not reflective of the addresses by county of the applicants. This particular information is not readily available.</p><p>  Law centres are almost invariably unable to offer legal services to all on demand and are obliged to operate a waiting list system for non prioritised matters. However every applicant is offered an appointment with a solicitor assuming that they meet the financial eligibility criteria and that their issue is of a nature that comes within the remit of the civil legal aid scheme. At that appointment they will get legal advice. Some applicants require representation in court either to take court proceedings or to defend court proceedings. In those cases the solicitor makes an application to the Board for a legal aid certificate on the person&rsquo;s behalf. The Board does not retain a breakdown by law centre of the number of these applications that are granted/refused.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Number of applicants in each of the last three years at the law centre(s) in each of the counties in which the Board has a full time presence</b><table><tr><th><div>County</div></th><th><div>2013</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td><div>193</div></td><td><div>279</div></td><td><div>281</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td><div>472</div></td><td><div>582</div></td><td><div>739</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td><div>1,809</div></td><td><div>2,208</div></td><td><div>2,357</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td><div>643</div></td><td><div>636</div></td><td><div>670</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td><div>4,532</div></td><td><div>5,600</div></td><td><div>4,821</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>871</div></td><td><div>939</div></td><td><div>603</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>610</div></td><td><div>609</div></td><td><div>611</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>858</div></td><td><div>884</div></td><td><div>1,027</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td><div>784</div></td><td><div>747</div></td><td><div>836</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td><div>406</div></td><td><div>523</div></td><td><div>622</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><div>707</div></td><td><div>853</div></td><td><div>732</div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td><div>444</div></td><td><div>378</div></td><td><div>383</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>320</div></td><td><div>381</div></td><td><div>379</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>371</div></td><td><div>393</div></td><td><div>398</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td><div>785</div></td><td><div>574</div></td><td><div>560</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>371</div></td><td><div>469</div></td><td><div>389</div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td><div>349</div></td><td><div>423</div></td><td><div>408</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td><div>319</div></td><td><div>459</div></td><td><div>319</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td><div>632</div></td><td><div>503</div></td><td><div>636</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>505</div></td><td><div>562</div></td><td><div>580</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td><div>511</div></td><td><div>557</div></td><td><div>550</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>498</div></td><td><div>590</div></td><td><div>589</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td><div>557</div></td><td><div>696</div></td><td><div>797</div></td></tr></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

This decrease in expenditure is mostly attributed to a reduction of 10% in fees payable which was implemented on 1 October 2011.  Unfortunately figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown by county. </p><p>  The Courts Policy Division of my Department will forward a list outlining payments made under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to solicitors and barristers in 2013 to the Deputy.</p><p>  The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if they cannot afford to pay for legal representation, there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him/herself in person or through legal assistance of his/her own choosing or, if he/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p><p>  There is no limit to the number of occasions a person can be granted legal aid under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.</p><p>  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.</p></reply>

The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning. </p><p>  Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with the ETBs and a range of other educational agencies.  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the ETBs (220 in the academic year 2012/13).  The Service seeks to deliver relevant programmes that cater for holistic needs, ensure broad access and high participation, and prioritise those with basic education needs. It promotes the principles of adult and community education and supports a multi-disciplinary approach within the prison system. </p><p>  Programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover. Educational courses and curricula which are based on individuals participating in one or more subject areas for an academic year and then sitting examinations are only appropriate for a small number of prisoners. </p><p>  The Junior and Leaving Certificate courses are available but increasing numbers of prisoners require a more flexible curriculum which has multiple entry and exit points that take account of prior educational attainment. FETAC accreditation is therefore widely used with assessment by portfolio compilation. All prison Education Centres meet the quality assurance standards demanded by FETAC. </p><p>  Organisations who provide in-reach education roles include Open University, the Samaritans, the Red Cross, Grow, Toe by Toe, Writers and Artists in prison. Other courses run through the education centres include pre-release programmes, parenting, hairdressing, Alternatives to Violence.  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.   <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Court fees orders are made by myself as the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>  During 2013, the Courts Service carried out a comprehensive review of court fees. The review considered areas in which court fees were unduly low having regard to the service being provided. It also examined the scope to harmonise and standardise court fees within and across jurisdictions to facilitate the introduction of on-line fee payments and the scope to introduce fees for items that were currently exempt from fees. Fees for new areas of work which were not reflected in the existing fees orders were proposed and the impending increase in the jurisdictional limits of the Circuit and District Courts, which since came into effect on 3 February 2014, was taken into consideration.  The Supreme Court and High Court (Fees) Order 2014 (S.I. 24 of 2014)  also came into effect on the 3 February 2014.  This order, which includes the fee for Supreme Court Appeals,  was made on foot of recommendations from the Courts Service on appropriate scales of court fees and charges in accordance with Section 6 (2)(e)of the Courts Service Act, 1998.   As the Deputy will appreciate, court fee income forms a significant part of the funding for the general operation of the courts and the Courts Service keeps its fee structure under continuous review in accordance with the power given to it under the Courts Service Act.  In view of the foregoing, I  have no plans to reverse the fees introduced on 3 February last.</p></reply>

With that in mind, I will be inviting local authorities to follow up on their estimates of damage by applying for funding under the programme and to indicate their prioritised list of eligible projects on a county-by-county basis for consideration for funding for repair of the damage caused by the recent storms. The funding will be focussed on infrastructural repairs to fisheries and aquaculture-related harbours, piers and slipways.  </p><p>  In addition to the funding to be provided to local authorities, my Department will be moving to repair storm damage to piers, harbours and coastal infrastructure in its direct ownership. This will include moving as quickly as possible to repair the significant storm damage to North Harbour in Cape Clear, west Cork; Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre, County Waterford; the Gun Rock beacon, Inisboffin, County Mayo; the West Cove navigational beacon, County Kerry; and Roonagh Pier, County Mayo. </p><p>  In relation to inshore fishermen, a temporary one-off scheme of assistance to these pot fishermen will be administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The scheme will be focused on smaller inshore fishermen, with vessels under 15 metres. It will provide a set amount of &euro;24 per lobster pot lost or &euro;12 per shrimp pot lost, equivalent to 40% of the replacement cost, and will be capped at a maximum of 50 pots for under 12 metre vessels and 100 for under 15 metre vessels.  A fisherman who has lost 100 pots at the replacement cost of approximately &euro;6,000 will receive assistance of a little under &euro;2,500. While I am conscious that some pot fishermen have reported losses of several hundred pots, I believe these are exceptional cases.  </p><p>  A fisherman availing of these schemes will be required to provide certain evidence to BIM to show that he was actively pot fishing in the months before the storms and evidence of purchase of pots that were lost. In addition, he will be required to make a sworn declaration concerning his losses. The budget for this Scheme will be borne by the existing Vote within my Department and is not additional funding. There is no scope to increase this budget further, so I am emphasising that should applications exceed this budget, the rate of assistance will be reduced, either in terms of the amount of payment per pot or the maximum number of pots, in order to remain within a managed budget.</p><p>  The Deputies will agree that these are significant interventions in the current economic circumstances and are a clear indication of this Government's commitment to rural coastal communities and the inshore fishing sector.</p></reply>

DAS (now to be known as Areas of Natural Handicap) is to be delineated by Member States using soil and climatic criteria, as proposed by the Commission, as follows:</p><p> - Climate, including Low Temperature and Heat Stress;</p><p> - Soil, including Drainage, Texture &amp;amp; Stoniness, Rooting Depth and Chemical Properties;</p><p> - Soil &amp;amp; Climate, including Soil Moisture Balance;</p><p> - Terrain, including Slope.</p><p>  An area (administrative unit) would be delineated as an area of Natural Handicap, when it meets the proposed threshold set for one of the above criteria only. The Commission are suggesting the delineation be carried out a LAU2 level &ndash; DED in Ireland's case. To qualify under the new system, an area will need to show that at least two-thirds of its utilised agricultural land meets at least one of these eight criteria.</p><p>  The resultant Areas of Natural Handicap would be subject to a fine-tuning process. These so called Second Stage Criteria are designed to remove areas which, although they meet the biophysical criteria, are deemed to have overcome the natural disadvantage and, therefore, should not benefit under the Scheme. The Second Stage Criteria would not apply to the criteria Low Temperatures, Heat Stress and Slope. The suggested ones for the other criteria are as follows:</p><p> - Soil Moisture Balance: Fine tune using % of area that is covered by fixed irrigation;</p><p> - Drainage: Take account of the artificial drainage, which can in effect move soils from one class to another;</p><p> - Texture and Stoniness, Rooting depth and Soil Chemical properties: Fine tune using production related indicators.</p><p>  Commencement of the process must firstly await finalisation of the Teagasc innovative Irish Soil Information System (ISIS), which is designed to complete the national soil survey and which is scheduled for completion in late 2014. On completion of ISIS the necessary comprehensive delineation may initially commence to see which land is included and excluded as Areas of Natural Handicap. Under the CAP Reform agreement, Member States have until 2018 to introduce a new regime.</p></reply>

It is one of our largest non-EU markets and the strong 2013 sales performance contributed greatly to the rise in value of overall pigmeat exports by 3% in 2013 to &euro;525m.  </p><p>  In January 2014 the Lithuanian authorities discovered two cases of African Swine Fever in wild boar near its border with Belarus. They put in place the required disease control measures and informed fellow member states and the EU Commission of the outbreak.  The EU Commission, being the competent authority for agreeing sanitary and phytosanitary matters on behalf of the EU informed the OIE, the international organisation for animal health. </p><p>  The EU Commission proposed, under Chapter 4 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, to provisionally exclude the affected region in Lithuania from exporting pigs and pigmeat to other countries including Russia, thereby &ldquo;regionalising&rdquo; the outbreak and allowing other EU Member States not affected by the disease to trade freely in live pigs, pigmeat and pigmeat products.  </p><p>  The value of the Terrestrial Code is twofold; the measures published in it are the result of consensus among the veterinary authorities of OIE members, and it constitutes a reference within the World Trade Organisation Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures as an international standard for animal health and zoonoses.  </p><p>  However, the Russian Federation and Customs Union refused to accept regionalisation of the disease and imposed a ban on all exports of pigs, pigmeat and pigmeat products from the EU certified after 26 January 2013.  </p><p>  A meeting took place last week in Vilnius between the EU Commission and Russian Federation   and while no progress was registered the Commission continues to pursue the matter with urgency. </p><p>  I am in agreement with the EU Commission that the ban is  disproportionate as it does not respect the OIE rules on regionalisation.  The Commission services are currently considering instigating a WTO panel action against the Russian Federation for its non-respect of the regionalisation provision.</p><p>  I spoke on the matter at the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday of this week and I confirmed that Ireland supports the Commission approach to protecting the OIE based regionalisation approach to managing animal disease outbreaks. I urged fellow Member States to continue to act as one on this issue and to show support for the Commission`s approach to dealing with the current difficulty.</p><p>  I warned that time is running out for producers and processors in the EU and I encouraged the Commission to step up its efforts to find a solution soon. This solution needs to bring to an end to this unnecessary blanket ban on EU product while assuring the continued protection of the EU against the threat of animal disease.</p><p>  My Department officials met with industry representatives last week to update them on developments and will continue this arrangement until the matter is resolved.</p><p>  On a positive note the Russian Federation agreed this week to lift the ban on finished product containing pork subject to certain conditions and treatment of the meat before export.  This however accounts for only a small proportion of our exports to Russia.</p></reply>

In general this group holds low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. </p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2009 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme. The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have the immediate benefit of an additional &euro;10.3 million in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. </p></reply>

This higher throughput has led to factories giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the requirements of their retail customers. Prices for &lsquo;in-spec&rsquo; steers and heifers are relatively stable. While the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to affect demand, the young bull kill has increased by 60% between week 1 and week 6 of 2014.</p><p>  The Irish beef industry is hugely dependent on exports and the need to ensure that it is producing efficiently for overseas markets cannot be ignored. Finished cattle prices continue to be impacted by weak demand, particularly for manufacturing beef, in key export markets. One of the main difficulties in marketing young bulls over 16 months at age is that these animals are outside the specifications preferred by the UK market. This is a major disadvantage at present because the UK market has effectively become the highest-priced beef market in the EU.</p><p>  With regard to winter finishers, it must be remembered that most cattle are traded several times during their lifetime based on their perceived value to producers and the price at which they are bought and sold is determined by supply and demand in the marketplace. The particular difficulties experienced by producers who market cattle over the winter period were considered by the Beef 2020 Activation Group, which was established to set out the actions necessary to achieve Food Harvest 2020 targets. The Group&rsquo;s report noted that a more widespread use of contracts would provide price certainty for winter finishers but acknowledged the problems faced by the processing industry in moving to a generalised contract system. </p><p>  Bull beef production is a specialised system of production and delays in young bull slaughtering undoubtedly put pressure on producer profit margins. However, neither I nor any Agriculture Minister can interfere in a trade that is cyclical in nature and prone to short-term price fluctuations. I am, of course, entirely sympathetic to those farmers still facing difficulties in getting their cattle slaughtered but I have no function in relation to commercial transactions between the meat factories and their suppliers. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of the industry &ndash; in this instance, processors and farmers working together &ndash; to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain operates for the benefit of both parties and does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. The current situation strongly underlines the need for the industry to improve communication on market trends and signals along the supply chain. An industry-led solution to clear the backlog of bull beef is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to engage constructively in discussions on the issue.</p><p>  Recognising the importance of maintaining confidence in the beef sector, I recently announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014. This package will include a &euro;23m for Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the suckler beef sector. It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the 2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.</p></reply>

In general, the relief applies provided the beneficiary qualifies as a 'farmer'. To qualify for agricultural relief, the person receiving the gift or inheritance must be a 'farmer' at the Valuation Date</p><p><i><i>Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers</i></i></p><p>  This relief provides for a full exemption on stamp duty on transfers of farm land to certain young trained farmers. To qualify the young farmer must be less than 35 years of age and must of have attained a minimum agricultural education standard. This measure was extended in Budget 2012 for a further three year period until 31 December 2015.</p><p><i><i>Enhanced Stock Relief from Income Tax</i></i></p><p>  Enhanced rates of stock relief are provided for in certain circumstances &ndash; A 100% stock relief rate is available for up to four years for certain young trained farmers. This measure was extended in Budget 2013 to the end of 2015. If a young dairy farmer has used the four year window of claiming the 100% stock relief, he/she can avail of a 50% rate of stock relief if they participate in a registered Milk Production Partnerships. This measure was introduced until end of 2015 in Budget 2012.</p><p><i><i>Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax</i></i></p><p>Retirement relief from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on land transfers is available where an individual over 55 years<sup></sup>  disposes of some or all of his land once certain criteria are met. There are two separate Retirement relief thresholds depending on the relationship of the transferor to the transferee. Budget 2012 introduced the following changes to the &ldquo;transfers of land to a child&rdquo; thresholds with effect from the 1 January 2014, with the 2 year lead in period flagged in advance to allow for an orderly transition;</p><p>  -  Irrespective of the amount of consideration for the transfer, full CGT relief may be claimed by a person aged between 55 &ndash; 66 years of age on the transfer to his/her child.</p><p>  -  For land transfers by persons aged over 66 years of age the amount of full CGT relief is only available on considerations up to &euro;3 million, again to encourage earlier lifetime transfer of land holdings.</p><p>  -  If the child disposes subsequently of the land within 6 years, clawback of the above reliefs applies.</p><p>  These taxation measures reflect the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the agri-food industry and in particular to the expansion planned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. Recognising the importance of all taxation measures in the farming sector, a review was recently announced in Budget 2014. The &lsquo;AgriTaxation Review&rsquo; will analyse the benefits of the various tax measures to the agriculture sector and the wider economy versus the costs, i.e. value for money to the economy. The overall objective of the review is not to change the level of support to the sector through the tax system but rather to maximise the benefits to the sector and the economy for that existing level of support. Two of the six key policy areas identified for examination are 1) encouraging and attracting young farmers and new entrants to farming and 2) succession &ndash; earlier lifetime transfers within families (and non-family transfers also where no apparent successor available). The public consultation process for the Review was launched on Tuesday 11th February 2014 and will run to Tuesday 25th March 2014, a period of 6 weeks. It is planned that the Review&rsquo;s findings will form part of the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s considerations in the context of Budget 2015.</p><p>  In addition to the tax reliefs my Department has also provided a range of on-farm supports, most of which were supported under the old Common Agriculture programme. These on-farm supports included:</p><p>  -  the New Entrants to Dairying Scheme (which helped revitalise the sector through the provision of milk quota to dynamic educated farmers);</p><p>  -  the Dairy Efficiency Programme (which encouraged the adoption of best practice management and production methods on farm by means of Discussion Groups);</p><p>-  the Dairy Equipment Scheme which had a weighting towards young farmers and had as its aim the encouragement of   new entrants/young farmers in milk production by providing them with a financial support to meet the capital costs associated with either starting up or taking over a dairy enterprise, and ensuring that they have the most up to date technology available to compete in the modern dairy sector.</p><p>  -  the provision of financial support for ICBF and Animal Health Ireland to improve breed quality and animal health. </p><p>  The new CAP Programme will facilitate the introduction of further supports in the areas of knowledge transfer and capital equipment and I propose to announce such supports over the coming months.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-18a.1494.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021800075#WRX02800"><p>In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land. In general this group holds low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. </p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2009 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme. The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have the immediate benefit of an additional &euro;10.3 million in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. </p><p>  I have recently announced details in relation to the measures proposed for inclusion in the new Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014-2020.  These proposed measures form the basis for a public consultation in relation to the new RDP, and written submissions have been invited by 19 February.  Details in relation to the consultation process and the proposed measures for the new RDP can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The consultation process will inform the next stage of RDP design, including the detailed development of new schemes.</p></reply>

The position is that  the administrative functions are being transferred to the Cavan office but the Department&rsquo;s vets, inspectors and technical officers will remain in place at the existing local offices to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from these offices. Frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will continue to be available in the Tullamore office.</p><p>  The transfer of the administrative functions out of the Tullamore office arises from an extensive review of the local office structure which was carried out by the Department over the last number of years.  This review concluded that, arising from investment in technology and the substantial reduction in disease levels in recent years, significant efficiencies would accrue from the centralisation of administrative functions in two centres, thereby giving rise to significant scope for redeployment of administrative staff from existing local offices.  The process of centralising the administrative functions commenced in 2012 and is on-going.</p><p>  In line with Government policy, the Department has actively sought redeployment opportunities for administrative staff in local Offices and staff have already been transferred from the local offices in Limerick, Tipperary, Enniscorthy and Waterford to other Departments and agencies, such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, in order to enable those bodies to provide important services, including the property tax, Garda vetting etc.  With regard to Tullamore, the Department is finalising arrangements to redeploy administrative staff from the Tullamore Local Office to the Department of Public Expenditure (Shared Payroll Services) in Tullamore with effect from 1 March 2014. </p><p>  This Department will continue to maintain a public office in Tullamore and, indeed, in all of the locations from which the administrative functions are being transferred. The centralisation of administrative support should not impact negatively upon local access and services for local customers<font color="#004080">.</font></p></reply>

It is for this reason that the payment is restricted to those who are establishing or have established such a holding in the previous five years. In addition the restricting of the payment to a maximum of five years will make it possible to support those young farmers who will come on-stream in the years subsequent to 2015.</p><p>  Persons who establish their holding after May 2010 will qualify under the definition of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; provided that they also meet the other relevant criteria. </p><p>  Most farmers who have been farming for more than five years hold existing entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme. Where such farmers hold low value entitlements they will benefit significantly from the process of convergence that will apply under the Basic Payment Scheme. The purpose of the convergence model adopted by Ireland is to achieve a phased redistribution of payments between those who currently hold high value entitlements and those who hold low value entitlements. </p></reply>

Both yields and quality of later cut hay and silage were good, while yields of specialist crops such as fodder maize and beet were well above average. Excellent conditions last Autumn provided an opportunity for farmers to extend the grazing season. In this regard and in conjunction with my colleague Minister Hogan, a number of amendments to the Nitrates regulations were introduced to encourage additional production. The extension of the period for the application of organic fertilisers and the discounting of certain amounts of meal when calculating the amount of phosphorus fertiliser that could be used supported farmers to extend the grazing period last Autumn and in turn keeping animals grazing for longer.</p><p>  The situation continues to be monitored. Supplementary concentrate feeding has fallen significantly in cost since last year and significant volumes of fodder continue to be advertised on farming media and associated websites. Notwithstanding the recent difficult weather conditions, mild winter temperatures have also resulted in grass covers on farms that are well above last year.</p><p>  The indications are that there is a satisfactory supply of fodder available at present. The quality of fodder conserved is generally excellent on farms and subject to a normal spring turnout, overall quantity should be sufficient. At this time, and subject to normal spring conditions prevailing, it is anticipated that adequate supplies of fodder will be available.</p></reply>

When considering the impact of the transition from the current Single Payment Scheme to the new Basic Payment Scheme, there are three &lsquo;reference points&rsquo; to be considered. </p><p>  Any farmer who received a direct payment in 2013 (Single Payment, Grassland Sheep Scheme, Burren Life Scheme, Beef Data Scheme) is automatically eligible to receive an allocation of entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015. It is presumed that the Company received such a payment in 2013 and therefore holds the &lsquo;allocation right&rsquo;.</p><p>The <b><i>number</i></b>   of entitlements that will be allocated to a farmer under the new Basic Payment Scheme will be based on the number of eligible hectares the farmer declares in 2013 and 2015, whichever is less.

The Adoption (Information and Tracing ) Bill will address this matter but the legislature will be constrained in the nature of any access which can be granted to adoption records by these legal considerations. My Department is continuing to work on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible.  However, as I have previously advised the House, very complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill, in particular  in seeking to reconcile an adopted person&rsquo;s request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent.  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues and I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  </p><p>  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration. The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.   In the meantime I am open to any proposals or suggestions in relation to policy on this matter that assists in achieving as much access as possible in a manner that is legally and constitutionally sound. </p><p>  I have been anxious to see improvements in existing procedures for the tracing of birth parents by people who have been adopted.  The Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1st January last, has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the Agency implement much more improved and consistent arrangements. I have been advised by the  Agency that it is reorganising adoption services in 2014 at a national level,  and will consider how best to deploy its staff to deal with this important issue so as to facilitate access to records where they exist. </p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring records from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Agency.  In the case of the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, for example, some 25,000 records have been transferred to the Agency&rsquo;s Regional Adoption Service in Cork.  Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these records has taken place.  The advice of the National Archives has been sought in relation to the proper storage of these records that are of great significance. </p><p>  I have raised the importance of arrangements for the management of these records directly with the Child and Family Agency and I have also asked my officials to examine the work that could be undertaken with the Child and Family Agency, the Adoption Authority and other stakeholders to improve arrangements for managing and accessing the records that are available. </p><p>  I would urge birth mothers to enrol on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register which was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  Applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register.  I believe there is an opportunity in the context of the considerable public attention this area is receiving to promote awareness amongst women whose children were adopted of the importance of registering their consent for contact to be re-established.   </p></reply>

Within the Child and Family Agency, the Education Welfare Service has specific responsibility for the Agency&rsquo;s general function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. </p><p>  The primary role of the Educational Welfare Officer (EWO) in this service is to advise and assist both schools and parents in relation to their respective rights and responsibilities on issues relating to school attendance, including suspensions. While an EWO can offer advice and support to a school principal in relation to the suspensions of an individual pupil, it is ultimately a matter for the school authorities to determine policy and practice around suspensions.</p><p>  The Educational (Welfare) Act 2000 obliges the principal of a recognised school to notify an Educational Welfare Officer where a student is suspended for a period of not less than six (6) days. On receipt of such a notification an EWO will consult as appropriate with the school, parents/guardian and student in relation to the continued education of the child and his or her full participation in school.  Under Section 29(1)(b) of the Education Act 2000, a parent/guardian may appeal a suspension of a student.</p><p>Guidance issued to all schools in <i>Developing a Code of Behaviour</i>  (2008) by the then National Educational Welfare Board  covers a wide range of issues relating to suspension as an element of behaviour management planning, including;</p><p>  -  When is it appropriate to use suspensions?</p><p>  -  When is it not appropriate?</p><p>  -  Length of suspensions</p><p>  -  Opportunity to appeal the decision of a principal to the Board of Management</p><p>  -  Grounds for the removal of a suspension</p><p>  -  Appeals under the Education Act 1998</p><p>  -  Obligations to report under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.</p><p>It has been the experience of the Educational Welfare Service that school Principals generally are open to advice from EWOs based on the guidance in <i>Developing a Code of </i>  Behaviour and very often seek the assistance of their assigned EWO in such matters. </p></reply>

The current, essentially ad hoc, arrangements for the operation and management of guardian ad litem services is a legacy issue which my Department is addressing as a priority this year in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality.  </p><p>  My Department is actively examining all aspects of service provision in this area, with a view to the introduction of more regulated and sustainable provision which will address a range of issues including payment arrangements.  While mindful that it is, in fact, the courts who appoint guardians ad litem in care proceedings,  the examination is taking account of the potential key elements of a reformed service such as criteria for the engagement of guardians ad litem, their role and responsibilities, their status, necessary qualifications and experience for appointment, and the basis for their remuneration.  </p><p>  Other reforms which have already been initiated or completed as part of the wider programme of legal reform relating to children are also very relevant.  These reforms include  the establishment of the Child and Family Agency on 1 January last, the amendment to Section 17 of the Child Care Act enacted in 2013 to reduce the frequency and related cost of renewing interim care orders, the introduction of national procedures relating to Court practice by the Child and Family Agency, the examination being given by the Minister for Justice and Equality to the establishment of dedicated Family Courts and the referral of a draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill in respect of the Children and Family Relationships Bill to the Oireachtas.  This latter proposed legislation, which is being taken forward by the Minister for Justice and Equality, signals the proposed introduction of revised arrangements for guardians ad litem in respect of certain family law proceedings. This is an important context for the collaboration which is underway between both Departments.</p><p>  I plan to bring forward legislative proposals to reform this area in the current year in collaboration with the Minister for Justice and Equality.   </p></reply>

Given the changing landscape of intercountry adoption, this may no longer be the case. I am  examining a number of proposals in relation to amendments to the Adoption Act, 2010.  Any change to the length of validity of a declaration must take account of the necessity to ensure that an applicant's current situation in relation to their suitability to adopt is considered in the adoption process.</p></reply>

These programmes include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childhood Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. </p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community childcare not-for-profit services to enable them to charge reduced childcare rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low to middle incomes.  Parents qualify for support on the basis of their social welfare entitlement or their income status.  Parents participating in the Springboard programme can apply for childcare support under the CCS programme if they have a qualifying social welfare entitlement.  The City and County Childcare Committees will advise parents of the qualifying criteria and of the  community services participating in the CCS programme in their area.  </p><p>  The eligibility criteria for parent participation in the Childhood Education and Training Support (CETS) programme is determined by Solas and the Education Training Boards, which come under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  The function of my Department is to monitor the take-up of childcare places available to those parents approved for support and to administer the relevant funding.  Determining which courses will enable parents to  qualify for support under the programme is therefore a matter for the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills. </p><p>  The ECCE programme is a universal programme implemented by my Department which provides one free pre-school year to all eligible children before they commence primary school. Children aged between 3 years and 2 months and 4 years and 7 months in September in the relevant year are eligible to avail of the free pre-school provision.</p></reply>

Wexford for the 2013/2014 school year. This funding was provided under the School Completion Programme following the consideration and approval of a service proposal received from Wexford Local Development in relation to the Meitheal programme.</p><p>The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a targeted intervention aimed at those school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. The School Completion Programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort. SCP<b></b>  supports 124 local projects operating in 472 primary and 225 post-primary schools across the country and a small number of stand-alone initiatives with compatible objectives. This includes five SCP projects currently in operation in Co. Wexford supporting 22 primary and 9 post primary schools, which were allocated just under &euro;970,000 this academic year. </p><p>  These school based projects provide a range of supports and interventions designed to support individual children identified by the Local Management Committee as being at risk of early school leaving within those school communities. This project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise creative and innovative approaches to address the needs of local young people most at risk of early school leaving. </p><p>  Having regard to the targeted nature of the School Completion Programme, my Department advised Wexford Local Development to engage with the existing local projects in relation to the Meitheal Programme with a view to ensuring a coherent and coordinated approach to delivery of support services in Co. Wexford. </p><p>The newly established Child and Family Agency is responsible for the strategic and operational direction of the School Completion Programme within the Education Welfare Services pillar of the Agency. Within this remit the Agency will manage the SCP budget and the allocation of funds to projects within the programme. It is understood that discussions between the SCP projects and Wexford Local Development are being facilitated by the Child and Family Agency with a view to   developing collaborative area based approaches to the provision of targeted supports within the SCP.  </p><p>  As with all major spending programmes, the School Completion Programme budget is subject to an adjustment under the terms of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure. I am advised that no proposals have yet been formulated by the Child and Family Agency in relation to funding for the 2014/2015 academic year. All allocations for the next academic cycle will be considered within the annual service planning process.</p></reply>

This arose from a clerical error whereby the <i>Administrative Costs</i>only were included as the <i>Total Payments </i>figure<i>.  </i>As pointed out previously, the error was corrected in the 2010 Accounts and I do not propose to have an audit undertaken on the matter.  </p><p>  All awards and costs of the Tribunal are paid by my Department on behalf of the Tribunal.  As each year progresses my Department recoups these costs from the two Special Accounts established under Sections 10 and 11 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts 1997 and 2002.  The Hepatitis C Compensation Scheme is demand led and it is difficult to accurately forecast payments within calendar years.  Furthermore, there is a timing issue between the making of payments by my Department on behalf of the Tribunal and the recoupment of such funds from the Special Accounts established under the Acts.  </p></reply>

The size of the market can also be a factor in the prices set by manufacturers.</p><p>  My Department and the HSE have implemented a medicines pricing policy which aims to reduce the prices for medicines/improve value for money whilst also maintaining continuity of supply and availability of essential medicines. These aims are balanced in an attempt to maximise public health gain from available resources. As part of the pricing policies there has been a price freeze (i.e. no price increases allowed except in exceptional circumstances) for a number of years.</p><p>  Over the last few years thousands of price reductions on medicines have occurred. For example, the price of over 500 different presentations of various medicines reduced by between 5% and 29% on the 1st November 2013 as a consequence of agreements reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI). In overall terms, price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per item reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels. </p><p>  Occasionally, price increases are required to maintain supplies of specific essential medicines. However, the HSE each year refuses a significant number of requests for price increases. Less than 50 price increases were allowed in the 8 years between 2006 and 2013.</p><p>  In October 2012, Aspen Pharma Trading Ltd  informed the HSE that, following an examination of the viability of a number of product lines, it had decided to increase the price of Purinethol in Ireland and a number of other EU countries (including Germany, UK, Denmark and Finland). </p><p>  The HSE engaged with the company in an attempt to negotiate a lower price, however, it was unwilling to do so.  The HSE was faced with the choice of allowing increased pricing (in line with other international markets) or running the risk that the product would be withdrawn.  Having regard to the importance of the product and the fact that Aspen Pharma Trading Ltd is the sole supplier to the Irish market, the HSE considered that a price increase was necessary to maintain supply and agreed to grant a price increase from 1 March 2013.  Despite the price increase, no other supplier has chosen to enter the Irish market.  Reversal of the price increase in the absence of an alternative supplier could result in the sole supplier exiting the market and patients being left without access to this medicine. </p><p>  In relation to price variations in Irish pharmacies, I would encourage patients to engage with their pharmacists to ensure they are getting best value for money when purchasing medicines. In this context, my Department has asked the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to consider how to provide for greater price transparency in pharmacies. </p></reply>

There are 32 Standards.  Each one is supported by a number of criteria.  These criteria are indicative rather than prescriptive, setting out how a service can be measured as to whether the standard is being met or not.</p><p>  Standard 25 addresses the physical environment for all types of nursing homes. When the Standards were introduced a distinction was made between new and existing facilities, indicating that, except in limited circumstances, existing facilities should have no more than two residents per room by 2015.  The Chief Inspector of Social Services (HIQA) has discretion to extend this timeframe.  In contrast the criteria for all new builds, new extensions or first time registrations indicate that a minimum of 80% of residents should be accommodated in single rooms and that all bedrooms should have en suite facilities.</p><p>  In 2013 HIQA issued a regulatory notice advising the sector that <i>&ldquo;where particular criteria regarding premises are not met in the Centre, the provider must provide clear evidence of the other ways by which they are reaching the Standard and must demonstrate to the Chief Inspector that these alternative arrangements are delivering on the Standard for each individual resident. In the case of Standard 25, the Chief Inspector will require substantial and exceptional justification for any premises which purports to meet Standard 25 without implementation of the individual criteria.&rdquo;</i></p><p>  In this context the HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet residential need now and in the future.</p></reply>

There is a link between consumption and harm and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  </p><p>  The Government has decided that minimum unit pricing is the most effective policy measure to deal with the sale of alcohol at cheap prices.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.  It is not expected that minimum unit pricing will affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade sector or the majority of alcohol products sold in the off-trade sector.</p><p>  A health impact assessment, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, has been commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.  The study should be finalised by the end of Quarter 2 this year.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to the provision and development of services for these children, having regard to available resources. </p><p>  The HSE National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report (2012) and the Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme set out the overall policy context for the provision of autism services to children and young people.  The objective of the Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services for children with a disability including those with autism so that there is a clear pathway to the services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  This Programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision that currently exist around the country.  In 2014, the HSE are taking a number of key steps in implementing the change programme, including rolling out a new model of assessment and intervention, in line with the Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People.  An additional &euro;4 million has been allocated, which equates to 80 additional therapy staff, for these purposes.  </p><p>  I have been advised by the HSE that it is not in a position to provide details regarding the amount of money that is currently being spent on autism services specifically.  The manner in which funding is allocated by the HSE allows for a distinction between broad categories of funding such as services for older people, primary care and disabilities in general. Disability services are provided based on the needs of an individual rather than by the actual type of disability. Individuals with autism or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome may attend autism-specific services or may obtain services from a service provider who provides services for a wide range of intellectual disabilities including autism.  </p><p>  I also understand that the HSE does not currently collect data on children and adults identified with autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome specifically, either on a national, or on a county basis. At the same time it is important to note that, due to the complexity of their presentation, many individuals with autism may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or a co-morbid mental health component.</p><p>  The health sector&rsquo;s National Intellectual Disability Database (NIDD), which was established in 1995, has been designed to provide a comprehensive and accurate information base for decision-making in relation to the planning, funding and management of services for people with an intellectual disability including individuals with autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome.  While the database presents information on the needs of people with intellectual disabilities, information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded, as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.  There is currently no epidemiological data regarding the prevalence in Ireland of Autistic Spectrum Disorder.</p><p>  However, I am advised that some estimates are available through the national census data. For example, the 2006 national census collected data on disability and a follow-up study, the National Disability Survey (NDS), was carried out on 16,000 people.  Approximately 22% of respondents to the NDS reported difficulties with intellect and learning.  Five percent of this group attributed their difficulties to an Autistic Spectrum Disorder.  38% of the total group was aged 0-17 years and a further 25% were 18-35 years old.  Thus the prevalence of ASD within this cohort could be estimated to be in the order of 1.1%.  </p><p>  My Department has asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information requested in relation to assessment for autism.</p></reply>

If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds, as outlined in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE routinely considers whether the refusal of eligibility will result in undue financial hardship for the applicant or any dependants. Eligibility may be granted, on a discretionary basis, if the applicant cannot arrange general practitioner, medical and surgical services, for themselves and their dependants, without undue financial hardship. </p><p>  Medical card or GP visit card eligibility is not granted solely on the basis of a person&rsquo;s medical condition (other than persons affected by the drug Thalidomide or persons affected by Symphysiotomy).  Medical card applicants or their dependants, affected with primary immunodeficiency conditions, who submit supporting medical reports with an application for a medical card and who do not qualify for a medical card on an assessment of means, have the management of their medical condition considered during the assessment process to determine if the refusal of eligibility would result in undue financial hardship for the applicant or any dependants.</p><p>  I am advised that PCRS management has, in recent weeks, met with a number of health care professionals from Crumlin Children's Hospital who have specific responsibility for the treatment of children with significant primary immune deficiency disorders.  PRCS management clarified the process by which the assessment of medical card applications is undertaken and the granting of eligibility under the Medical Card Scheme.

The level of such fees paid is a commercial decision made by individual health insurers.</p><p>  I have consistently raised the issue of managing costs with the private health insurers and I have strongly urged them to reduce their overall costs including professional fees.  While there has already been some reduction in such professional fees with VHI reporting that it has reduced consultant fees to pre-2004 levels, I will continue to urge all health insurers to achieve further fee and cost reductions in the interests of consumers.</p><p>  In this regard, I appointed Mr. Pat McLoughlin to work with insurance companies and my Department on an independent review process to identify effective cost management strategies to help ensure the long-term sustainability of the private health insurance market.  I am currently examining Phase 1 of Mr. McLoughlin's report, <i>Review of Measures to Reduce Costs in the Private Health Insurance Market 2013</i>, which was published on 26th December 2013.  The second phase of Mr. McLoughlin&rsquo;s review commenced in January 2014 with a view to reporting within three months, and will study further the drivers behind rising costs in the health insurance industry and seek to address them.</p></reply>

These include: 1. A <i>Procurement Framework for Home Care Services</i> (with quality and screening requirements) came into effect in mid-2012.  These apply to services procured by the HSE from external providers. 2. <i>National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Home Care Package Scheme</i><b><i></i></b><i>were</i><b><i></i></b>introduced in parallel with above. 3. New<i> National Quality Guidelines for the Home Help Service </i>have been prepared.

Determining whether a person is "ordinarily resident" is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>  The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides for two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Persons with full eligibility (medical card holders) are entitled to a range of services without charge, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and maternity and infant care services.  People with limited eligibility (non-medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient pubic hospital services including consultants services.</p><p>  It is recommended, however, that the persons concerned, should contact the HSE local office in the area they want to move to (Dingle) and confirm how they might meet the conditions for ordinarily resident status if they wish to apply for public health care.  In relation to private health insurance, Open Enrolment Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, provide for maximum waiting periods for eligibility for payment under a health insurance contracting payments resulting from injury or accident, in respect of first entry to health insurance and in respect of pre-existing medical conditions.  The maximum waiting periods that an insurer may apply under the legislation is as follows: 26 weeks, in respect of a person who is under the age of 55 years; 52 weeks, in respect of a person who is of or over the age of 55 years and under the age of 65 years; 104 weeks, in respect of a person who is 65 years and over.</p><p>  In the case of &quot;pre-existing&quot; conditions the  maximum waiting period for eligibility for payments under a health insurance contract is: 5 years, for a person who is under the age of 55 years; 7 years, for a person who is of or over the age of 55 years and under the age of 60 years; 10 years, for a person who is of or over the age of 60 years and under the age of 65 years.</p></reply>

While these services are in the process of being reconfigured under the HSE&rsquo;s National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years), it is important to note that all HSE areas have significant services in place for children with disabilities aged up to eighteen years.  These are provided directly by the HSE or by voluntary service providers funded by the HSE.</p><p>  The aim of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  </p><p>  Almost 60 geographic-based multi-disciplinary teams have been established to date under the Programme as part of the reconfigured service model.  It is hoped that a further 30 teams will be reconfigured this year, bringing the overall total to approximately 90 teams by the end of 2014.  These figures reflect all children's disability teams that provide early intervention and school age services to children aged up to eighteen years.  The transition to this new model is taking place on a phased basis and, importantly, includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, such as service users and their families.  </p><p>  Within this context I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed information requested concerning children's disability services in Laois/Offaly.</p></reply>

The remit spans the whole of Government. It is a pillar of Government policy that people with disabilities should be empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society. The National Disability Strategy is driven by this basic, but fundamentally important, objective. It is Government's goal to develop the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.</p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy. That Implementation Plan was published in July 2013 and is the first such implementation plan to be put in place since the National Disability Strategy itself was launched in 2004. The Plan was prepared by the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group, which I established in 2011. I continue to chair the Group to oversee the implementation of the Strategy. The Implementation Group brings together representatives of the relevant Government Departments and representative organisations, including the Disability Federation of Ireland, and also a number of people with disabilities. Significant discussion was undertaken between disability stakeholders and Government Departments to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan. The Plan sets out the practical measures across all Government Departments that will be taken to advance the Strategy and ensure that available resources are used to best effect. Progress on the Plan is kept under review by the Implementation Group and thematic meetings, at which all relevant bodies are present to ensure cross-sectoral input and review, are convened. Two such thematic meetings were held in 2013 and focused on the themes of Housing and Irish Sign Language.</p><p>  The vision for the Health Service Executive's Disability Services Programme is to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life. The Health Service Executive National Service Plan 2014 and the recently published 2014 Operational Plan for the Social Care Division outline the quantum of specialist disability services, the key reform initiatives and the additional investment in 2014 which it has assured me will give effect to this vision in 2014. The HSE will spend &euro;1.4 billion and employ a staff level of approximately 15,000 whole time equivalents in 2014 to provide specified levels of services. 2014 will also see an additional investment of &euro;14m to address deficits in disability services, a reform programme to transform services to a community based model of person centred supports, a focus on the implementation of the Health Information and Quality Authority standards for residential services for people with a disability. These developments and reform proposals will be carried out in an environment of effective communications and engagement with all those involved in services, including people with a disability and the Disability Federation of Ireland , through the HSE's National Consultative Forum.</p></reply>

Arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of front-line staff where there is an established service need. More generally, in order to mitigate the impact on front-line services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.</p><p>  It is Government policy to move to a consultant delivered service and there has been a significant increase in the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) over the past 5 years, the number increased from 2,260 in December 2008 to 2,555 in December 2013. However there are some specialties in which there is an international shortage and which have been traditionally difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale. There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals that have onerous rosters due to the limited number of consultants. The establishment of Hospital Groups will help to address this issue, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources - instead of to just one hospital.</p><p>  The ability of the public service to attract and retain high quality consultants shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required. If the health services are to continue to provide consultant-level opportunities for doctors to replace consultants who retire and eventually to expand overall capacity, this can only happen on the basis of a lower-cost model, hence the decision to reduce the pay of new consultants by 30%. This decision is being modified to enable consultants currently working in permanent posts within the public service to move to different posts, while retaining their existing salaries. Application of the revised guidance will support consultant mobility. Allowing serving clinical consultants retain their existing salaries will remove a blockage on movement within the system at present. This mobility will, in due course, also facilitate the roll-out of the Hospital Group model with staff appointed to the Group rather than being confined to specific locations.</p><p>  I set up a group under the chairmanship of Professor Brian McCraith last July to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures. The Group submitted an interim Report focused on training to me in December and is now progressing examination of the career structure to apply on completion of specialist training with a view to reporting to me by the end of March.

Considerable progress has been made over the last 12 months on progressing compliance with the provisions of the Working Time Directive in respect of NCHDs.  Data from the HSE shows that average working hours for NCHDs in 2009 was 60 hours a week, 54 hours per week in 2012 and 51.4 hours in the third quarter of 2013.</p><p>  The HSE is focused on advancing implementation of the Directive. Intensive negotiations conducted at the Labour Relations Commission in September and October resulted in agreement on a joint approach, involving hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs to achieving EWTD compliance. The agreement focused in particular on steps to be taken in the period up to the NCHD rotation on 13th January 2014 to eliminate shifts in excess of 24 hours. At a meeting between the HSE and the IMO on 6th February the progress made by the acute hospitals on achieving compliance with the agreed maximum 24 hour shift target was assessed. While the majority of hospitals have made significant progress, arising from that assessment the Director of Acute Hospitals will be imposing fines on a minority of hospitals where sufficient progress has not been achieved. This is in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</p><p>  NCHD recruitment and retention is required in order to facilitate the achievement of EWTD compliance. Achievement of full compliance will also require reorganisation of the delivery of certain services within Hospital Groups. The number of NCHDs in the public health system has increased by over 200 in recent years and now exceeds 4,900. However, there are international shortages of NCHDs in certain categories and specialties. There are also some hospitals to which it has been difficult to attract NCHDS, for a range of reasons including training opportunities and rural location.</p><p>  I set up the MacCraith Group to undertake a Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career structure last Summer. The Group is to make recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system, planning for future service needs and achieving the maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.  The Group provided an Interim Report in December 2013 focusing on training and is now examining career structures and pathways following training with a view to preparing a report by the end of March 2014. It will provide the final report by the end of June 2014.</p><p>  As it is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to revert directly to the Deputy in relation to the hospitals which have yet to comply with the EWTD.</p></reply>

I expect to have a further meeting with senior EIB officials next month when access to funding for transport projects will be further discussed.</p><p>  DART Underground remains a key element of the overall public transport integration strategy as it would deliver a quantum improvement in rail accessibility to the city centre with  benefits for  each of the four rail corridors radiating from the city centre. The National Transport Authority (NTA) which has statutory responsibility for  planning and developing public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area has include DART Underground as a key project in their &quot;Draft Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2011 - 2030&quot;.</p><p>  Apart from some limited work related to supporting projects there is no funding for the overall DART Underground  programme in the current capital plan to 2016.   Advance work on preparations for the capital plan post-2016 has commenced and projects will be prioritised arising from that work taking account of their costs and benefits and the funding available.</p><p>  The overall cost of DART Underground was estimated at just over &euro;4 billion in 2010. Over &euro;2.6 billion is the estimated cost of the Tunnel with associated works such as electrification, re-signalling and rolling-stock accounting for the balance.</p></reply>

That process, which was managed by the NTA, has concluded and all applicants have been informed of the outcome of the selection process.  The NTA has offered debriefing meetings to all unsuccessful applicants who requested one and is currently scheduling meetings with the successful applicants to initiate the process to establish the TCUs. I should add in the context of rural development that under the new RTP structure, for the first time local authorities will have a role in transport planning.  Local authorities will carry out strategic transport needs assessment in their areas, including for those who are socially excluded, and will develop annual transport plans, in consultation with the respective TCU, which will inform the NTA of transport gaps and needs in each county. It is also the intention that local authorities will house the TCUs where feasible. Finally, I recognise that tourism is particularly important to rural areas as a source of employment, particularly where there are often few other significant industries. My Department is currently engaged in a tourism policy review which is due to conclude by the middle of the year and these and other issues will be considered in that review.</p><p>  The wider question of the development of a rural development strategy is of course for the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

While some limited trials have been conducted in the United States, the technology is not yet sufficiently advanced for its general installation to be made mandatory.</p><p>  However, even though its mandatory inclusion in EU or UNECE vehicle type approval is not an imminent prospect, there is research and development taking place in the EU.  As part of Intelligent Transport Systems initiatives, EU-funded research projects have played a major role in the development of V2V standards, with more than &euro;180 million invested in some 40 different projects working on cooperative systems since 2002. These projects provided their results to ETSI and CEN/ISO, which in turn used them to develop standards.  The EU also funded different operational tests and pilots, as well as standardisation project teams. </p><p>  Work has already begun to fine tune existing standards and to deal with more complex use cases.  European organisations cooperate closely with American and Japanese organisations to ensure that the systems are compatible across the globe.  Following further development and trials, the normal progression would be to negotiate the inclusion of V2V technology in type approval standards.  Given the current state of development, it is unlikely that such a position will be reached in the near future, and I have no proposals to require its unilateral introduction in Ireland in advance of general type approval.</p></reply>

Road charging is an option that is open to any Member State and can contribute to the funding of a country&rsquo;s road infrastructure, particularly in the context of ensuring that out-of-state hauliers who use the infrastructure make a contribution to its funding.</p><p>  The new UK road user levy, due to come into effect on 1 April 2014, introduces a charge on all HGVs weighing 12 tonnes or more for use of UK roads including those in Northern Ireland.  I have previously expressed my concerns regarding the impact this levy will have on Irish hauliers to my UK and Northern Ireland colleagues.  Furthermore, I have sought exemptions for some roads in Northern Ireland to reduce the impact of the levy on Irish hauliers.  The issue has also been discussed at transport sectoral meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.  I will be meeting my colleague in the UK, Stephen Hammond M.P., Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport in late February and I intend to raise this issue directly with him again.</p><p>  As at 31 December 2013 there were 317,849 goods vehicles taxed in Ireland, of which 9,500 were 12 tonnes or more in weight.  This means that 3% of Irish-registered goods vehicles are within the scope of the UK levy.  I do not believe it is likely that a significant proportion of this cohort of Irish-registered goods vehicles that are subject to the UK levy will migrate to alternative jurisdictions.  Any operators that do so will then be subject to the cabotage regulations that apply to out-of-state operators and their transport operations within Ireland will consequently be greatly restricted.

Research by the Gathering project team indicates that 250-275,000 of the additional overseas visitors to Ireland travelled because of The Gathering, and these visitors were worth an estimated &euro;170 million in revenue.  My aim is to maintain the positive momentum that was created by The Gathering and ensure that we grow tourism numbers again this year.  There are a number of positive indications in this regard.  For example, all of the increased air capacity secured for the year of The Gathering has been retained for 2014, with a number of new additional routes also confirmed, and sea capacity has also increased this year.  Other legacy benefits include the opportunity to repeat some of the events that were initiated in 2013.</p><p>  The experience gained by using the community activation process, including town hall meetings and the Volunteer Ambassador programme, has provided many lessons which could be applied in future national or regional projects.  The Gathering was also highly successful in terms of using local authorities to set up a framework for mobilising communities and local organisation of events.  For example, F&aacute;ilte Ireland are using actively engaging communities to maximise the benefits of the Wild Atlantic Way.  Furthermore The Gathering increased the number of potential market contacts at both individual and group level and this information will help support future tourism marketing and promotions.  On a broader level, I anticipate the experience gained in many of these areas will be highlighted in the Tourism Policy Review which I am currently undertaking.  I hope to publish the new policy statement by Easter.</p></reply>

As it stands, legislation governing traffic and parking relates primarily to mechanically propelled vehicles.  I will examine the issue of animal-drawn vehicles in the context of the next Road Traffic Bill which I will introduce this year.  The practice of the holding of unauthorised sulky races on public roads which are open to traffic is dangerous and the whole area needs to be regulated.</p><p>  We already have procedures in which public roads can be closed to normal traffic for a period of time to allow for races, including marathons, cycle races and motorcycle races.  The Department is not proposing a complete ban on sulky races on public roads, but wants a new system where sulky racing can only be conducted in a way which is safe to the participants and to the public, and humane to the animals involved.  This would ensure that it would only be possible to hold properly approved sulky races on public roads when these conditions have been and where the road has been closed temporarily to normal traffic with the approval of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The hosting of major sports events, both participative and spectator sports, can provide a great showcase for Ireland, drive international visitor numbers and the media coverage of sports tourism events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination. </p><p>   Accordingly I am supportive of the ongoing efforts of the tourism agencies and the national governing bodies of sport to attract international events, subject, of course, to an assessment of the costs/benefits involved in any State financial support, in particular the number of overseas visitors. </p><p>   Other important sporting events take place each year, for example the GAA All-Ireland series, the Six Nations rugby and the Irish Open. Where appropriate, the tourism bodies work with these and other sporting bodies to maximise the tourism benefit of events.  For example, the Irish Open has in the past received significant support from F&aacute;ilte Ireland. </p><p>   Tourism Ireland is the body responsible for promoting the island of Ireland as a visitor destination in overseas markets.  Tourism Ireland, working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is promoting key sporting events taking place in 2014, including the visit of the Giro d&rsquo;Italia cycle race and the Croke Park Classic American football game, to encourage visits to Ireland.</p></reply>

In this regard, I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, that the Government imposed targets for new or increased credit facilities for SMEs on AIB and Bank of Ireland of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013. Both banks have achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets and I am informed that both banks sanctioned circa &euro;4bn in lending in 2013.</p><p>  AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets and they recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016, including lending to the tourism sector.  Although the targets were a useful policy intervention, the focus will now shift to compiling detailed data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector. </p><p>  This will facilitate the SME State Bodies Group and the Credit Review Office in monitoring progress against agreed annual SME lending plans and ensuring that new lending to SMEs continues to increase as a percentage of total sanctioned lending.   The Minister for Finance will keep this area under close scrutiny to ensure that the SME sector can access an adequate flow of credit to support the recovery of the economy.</p></reply>

With the vast majority of these visitors arriving by air, the importance of convenient, direct air access is critical to achieving growth in inbound tourism to Ireland. Tourism Ireland works with the Irish airports to fill strategic gaps and attractive incentive and marketing programmes are available to help support new services.</p><p>   Air access capacity to Ireland increased by 7% in 2013 compared to 2012, and this positive trend is set to continue this year. The &euro;0 rating for the airline Travel Tax announced in Budget 2014 will be introduced from April 2014. This was designed to generate additional air capacity to Ireland and has already reaped dividends in the shape of numerous new route announcements by both Irish and foreign airlines for the 2014 season.</p></reply>

These are available under &quot;Accommodation Statistics and Reports&quot; in the &quot;Research&quot; section of their website </p><p>  Since coming into office, the Government has taken key decisions to support tourism. The 9% VAT rate, which was initially a short-term measure, has been retained. The Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero from April, and this has helped to secure additional airline routes and capacity into Ireland. The Visa Waiver scheme, launched in July 2011, has helped grow visitor numbers from long-haul markets. </p><p>   The CSO estimate that in Q3 2013 133,300 people (seasonally adjusted) were employed in the accommodation and food service sectors alone. This represents an increase of almost 12% (14,200 extra jobs) since the same period 2012.  It is also the highest level of employment in the sector in the third quarter since 2007.  According to the CSO QNHS, the equivalent seasonally adjusted Q3 figures for employment in the accommodation and food services sector for the requested years are:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No.</th></tr><tr><td>2013 Q3</td><td>133,300</td></tr><tr><td>2012 Q3</td><td>119,100</td></tr><tr><td>2011 Q3</td><td>117,200</td></tr><tr><td>2010 Q3</td><td>125,000</td></tr></table>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has recently estimated that when other parts of the sector such as conferences, attractions and festivals are included the numbers in employment that the tourism and hospitality sector is supporting is now approaching 200,000.</p><p>  2013 has been a very good year for tourism. The CSO overseas tourism figures show that a total of just under 7 million overseas visits were recorded last year, representing an increase of 7.2% on the 2012 figure with all of our main overseas markets reporting growth.</p></reply>

An integrated and co-ordinated transport system is an important consideration when it comes to future decisions on transport investment. In making decisions as to future expenditure, my Department has been active to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken and that we do not look at land, maritime or aviation transport in isolation from each other. In previous times, this was a legitimate criticism of transport investment but I believe that, in recent years, this has been addressed. </p><p>  At a European level, my Department has been engaging and will continue to actively engage with the Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T) and to ensure it is integrated into Irish transport policy making.

This multi-modal EU policy is supported by domestic policy such as the new National Ports Policy that I launched in March 2013. For example the National Ports Policy's designation of Shannon-Foynes Port, Dublin Port and the Port of Cork as Ports of National Significance (Tier One) and Rosslare Europort and the Port of Waterford as Ports of National Significance (Tier Two) mirror the TEN-T designations of these ports as Core and Comprehensive ports on the TEN-T network. These designations are then taken into account by the National Transport Authority and the National Roads Authority when decisions are being made in terms of future planning.</p><p>  Other policy work is ongoing in my Department and I expect to publish two significant new transport policy papers in 2014. An aviation policy is now approaching completion while in relation to land transport, work is ongoing on a strategic framework for investment in land transport. Both the framework for investment and the aviation policy will help clarify transport priorities and will help to ensure that there is appropriate co-ordination and integration between the various modes. In a similar vein, the National Transport Authority have a statutory remit to develop an integrated transport plan for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and they are currently in the process of completing their implementation plan for transport investment in the GDA for the period to 2018. </p></reply>

The oversight of any such organisation in Ireland comes within the remit of the IAA whose primary functions are the oversight of the safety, quality and standard of the training being delivered, the conduct of examinations and flight tests.  They look at whether the company has sufficient resources to safely provide the training required to the internationally determined standards.  Regarding  oversight in the future I am referring the question to that body for direct reply   If you do not receive a response from them within 10 working days, please contact my private office.</p></reply>
