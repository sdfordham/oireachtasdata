Given the scale of the States investment some &euro;20.8 billion and the different financial instruments this money is invested in, there are a range of options available to recoup value from the bank and it is critical that we get these decisions right.  As a result Goldman Sachs International and William Fry are assisting the Department with this work by providing financial and legal advice respectively.  </p>  <p>  Reconfiguring the bank's capital structure, which is not longer fit for purpose given the new regulatory regime, is just the start of the process, but it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer.  Discussions commenced recently with the SSM (Single Supervisory Mechanism) and the Central Bank, AIB's regulators, regarding AIB's capital structure and this process is expected to take a number of months.  </p>  <p>  No decision has been made by the Government to sell any of our investments in AIB.  All options remain on the table and while I have said previously that an Initial Public Offering or IPO on the stock market, looks like the most likely exit route for the State, it is too early to specify what steps will be taken or to put a timeline on decisions.  Any sale will involve selling shares held by the ISIF.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated on numerous occasions, Government policy is that we will not remain a holder of our banking investments in the long term.  Given our high debt to GDP ratio, we do not have the luxury of holding all of these investments indefinitely and I envisage receipts from the gradual sale of these investments helping to play their part in reducing the State's overall debt burden in the coming years.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-23a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062300053#WRA01300"><p>It has been the consistent policy of the Government that proceeds received from the sale of assets should, to the greatest extent possible, be used to support and sustain economic recovery and employment creation.  Under Eurostat rules, the proceeds arising from the sale of the State's shares in Aer Lingus, representing the sale of a financial asset, will have no beneficial impact on Ireland's General Government Balance (GGB), and so will not provide any capacity for additional Government expenditure on a GGB neutral basis. </p>  <p>  For this reason the Government has decided to allocate the proceeds to a special fund - the Connectivity fund - which will operate on a commercial basis and therefore not constitute Government expenditure, but will facilitate the re-use of the proceeds for productive purposes within the economy on a GGB neutral basis.  </p>  <p>  The establishment of the new connectivity fund from the potential sale proceeds will be managed on a commercial basis by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  The Fund will be structured as a sub-portfolio of the ISIF, and will be managed and controlled in the same way as the main portfolio is managed.  </p>  <p>  Given that the proceeds came from the sale of the State's stake in a transport asset, the fund will be dedicated to enhancing connectivity both within and for the State.  It will allow for much needed investment in a range of commercially viable connectivity projects, both domestic and international.  The projects will generate economic impact and competitiveness benefits for Ireland through enhancing our regional connectivity, improving attractiveness and competitiveness in the tourism sector, and promoting investment and enhanced opportunities for growth.  For the purposes of the Fund, 'connectivity' will be broadly defined.  Therefore, connectivity will be taken to include traditional transport type projects, such as ports and airports, and access to such assets.  However, it will also take a wider definition of connectivity to include, for example, data connectivity (including broadband, fibre optic cables, interconnectors, etc) and energy connectivity (including energy inter-connectors and other related projects).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-23a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062300053#WRA01500"><p>Borrowers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities will be protected by the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 when it is enacted.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loan.  This Bill will require entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct.  Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated.  Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. </p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears specifically provides that the level of communications should be proportionate and not excessive, taking into account the circumstances of the borrowers, and that unnecessarily frequent communications should not be made.  </p>  <p>  The Bill was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February.  The Bill is continuing its progress through the legislative process.  The Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il on 17 June and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Second Stage in the Seanad tomorrow (24 June). </p>  <p>  The legislation will apply to all loans as defined, regardless of when they were acquired, thus capturing loan books that have already been sold.  A similar approach was used in 2013 in relation to debt management firms.  Also, when the requirement for a retail credit firm authorisation was itself introduced in 2007, existing non-deposit taking lenders (which up to then did not require authorisation from the Central Bank) had to get an authorisation from the Central Bank in order to continue their business.  The Bill has transitional provisions to allow existing firms seek and obtain authorisation from the Central Bank while continuing to do business.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this position, my officials do take an active interest in how the bank's cost base evolves to ensure that the State's interests as shareholder are protected and to ensure that the Government's remuneration policy is enforced. </p>  <p>  The bank has previously indicated that as part of its restructuring plan to reduce costs and increase efficiencies, outsourcing of certain functions would be considered in consultation with unions and affected staff.  I have also been informed by the bank that there have  been no compulsory redundancies as a result of its recent outsourcing activities.  Any staff who transfer under outsourcing arrangements transfer under the TUPE regulations.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that AIB has not at this stage confirmed any agreement to outsource some of its technology services in Application and Development Management teams to a third party provider.  Should any such decision be confirmed, then affected staff will be informed immediately and AIB will enter into a full process of information and consultation with employee representatives, as required both by law and under engagement principles agreed with the Irish Bank Officials Association (IBOA).</p>  <p>  As permitted by the relevant European Directive most occupational pension rights are not covered by Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (TUPE) in the Republic of Ireland (ROI.)  Occupational pension rights transfer on a limited basis under TUPE Regulations in Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that occupational pensions will form a key part of discussions during any consultation process that may arise with employee representatives.  In all previous similar transactions involving AIB, agreement has been reached between AIB and employee representatives in relation to pension issues.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-23a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062300053#WRA01900"><p>As you know, I met with senior management of Ireland's six main mortgage providers in May and outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.  There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.</p><p>In addition, I outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks.  This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates. </p><p>In advance of these meetings, I asked the Central Bank to prepare a report on the issue.  This report on the influences on standard variable rate pricing in Ireland was submitted to the Department of Finance last month and has been published on both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank websites.  </p><p>It is universally accepted that additional competition will have the effect of reducing prices to consumers, which in the mortgage sector means reducing the SVR.  Lower rates are available for many standard variable mortgage customers if they switch lender.  The banks must be convinced that they are at risk of losing customers if they persist with SVRs that are higher than the rate their customers could get elsewhere.  People who are in a position to move mortgages should look into their options to do so.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website at has useful information on mortgages and I understand that the CCPC is planning to provide better information to encourage mortgage switching.  I fully accept that this is not an option for everyone but I would encourage people to take the time to explore it. </p><p>The Government  made a commitment in the Statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016 to applying downward pressure on mortgage rates by increasing and supporting competition in the market and it will continue to work to fulfil that commitment.</p></reply>

The operational implementation of the Register is a complex process and the final timeline will be influenced by the scale of the technical and operational changes to be implemented by over 500 lenders. </p><p>In its Consultation Paper, the Central Bank sought views on its proposal to have an initial credit register implementation phase focusing on lending to individuals followed by a subsequent phase addressing commercial credit.  Responses to the Consultation Paper are now being reviewed and discussions continue on the phasing and extent of the data to be captured.  The Central Bank's intention is to establish a realistic schedule for lenders to commence data submissions and subsequently to access the Register information through enquiries.</p><p>In the meantime, lenders may continue to access the private credit bureau services they had heretofore used for consumer lending.

The first measure referred to is the stamp duty levies applying to the assets of funded pension arrangements introduced in 2011 to pay for the Jobs Initiative, the chargeable persons for which are the trustees of pension schemes and others responsible for the management of pension fund assets.  The second measure is the pension-related deduction (PRD) which has applied to the remuneration of public servants since 2009.</p>  <p>  The original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets ended last year.  The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, will also end after this year.</p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  </p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy collected as may be implied in the question.  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees etc) will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the income tax burden on low and middle income earners. </p>  <p>  With regard to the PRD, I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the application of the PRD to public servants resulted in an average reduction of some 7% in the remuneration of public servants (from March 2009) and was followed by a further reduction of 6% from 1 January 2010 in the remuneration rates applicable to public servants.  A third pay reduction applied to public servants earning in excess of &euro;65,000 with effect from 1 July 2013 at rates ranging from 5.5% to 10%.  I am further informed that these various reductions did not apply to employees of the organisations which form the membership of the pension scheme referred to in the question as they are not public service bodies for the purpose of the Financial Emergency Measures legislation under which these measures were introduced.</p>  <p>  Finally, while changes to the PRD are proposed from next year under the Lansdowne Road Agreement which will result in reductions in the PRD, particularly affecting public servants on low and middle incomes, there is no provision for the repayment of PRD already deducted from the remuneration of affected public servants.  </p></reply>

This is what was done in the case of Ireland and as a result we successfully exited the EU-IMF programme of financial support on the 15th of December 2013, and did so without the need for a pre-arranged backstop.  The programme met its key objectives - to put the public finances back on a sustainable path, to restore financial sector viability, to restore Ireland to financial market funding and to raise growth potential. Similar steps have been taken by other Member States including Spain and Portugal.</p>  <p>  I have stated before that I want Greece to remain in the euro area and that a nominal write down is off the agenda.  However, there is - of course - some room for manoeuvre in terms of maturity extension and other ways to reduce the burden of debt.  This is what we have done in Ireland, in cooperation with our European partners, with the extension of maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans, the reduction of interest rates, the replacement of the promissory notes with long-term bonds and the replacement of IMF loans with cheaper market-based funding. </p>  <p>   A revised list of counter proposals was submitted by the Greek authorities yesterday.  The Greek authorities will now work with the Institutions to come to an agreement by tomorrow that can be presented to the Eurogroup. </p>  <p>  Even at this very late stage, there is still time for a deal to be agreed.  It is still in everyone's interest that agreement is reached.  The situation of Greece's finances is very challenging with immediate financing needs to be addressed.  In addition, deposit outflows have continued from the banking system.  Therefore, urgent agreement on the necessary structural reforms is imperative to conclude the 5th review and release the associated disbursements.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware, however, that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 was passed by the D&aacute;il on 17th June and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Second Stage, which will be taken in the Seanad tomorrow(24th June).     The purpose of this legislation is to protect consumers whose loans are sold by regulated financial service providers to unregulated firms.  It will address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the Central Bank's codes and access for borrowers to the Financial Services Ombudsman after loan books are sold.   This legislation will ensure that borrowers retain their existing protections when their loan is sold.  A key element of this is the protection of distressed borrowers.  The CCMA, which the Deputy will be aware is a statutory Code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989, was revised in 2013 to strengthen consumer protections where necessary, and to ensure that the Code is facilitating the resolution of each case in a fair, sustainable and transparent manner.</p></reply>

Both Houses of the Oireachtas have approved these terms of reference.  An Taoiseach, as the Specified Minister for the Purposes of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, would have the statutory power to amend the terms of reference of the existing Commission of Investigation. </p>  <p>  In my view, the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into certain transactions in IBRC that have been the cause of significant public concern, does not necessitate a review into transactions in NAMA, AIB and the other publicly owned banks and institutions</p>  <p>  When it comes to NAMA, for example, it is important to point out that NAMA is already subject to a high level of public accountability compared to other commercial bodies, including commercial bodies in the State sector.  </p>  <p>   Importantly, NAMA's accounts are comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG), who has a permanent team of officers based in the Agency with unrestricted access to all its records and files, including all records and files relating to transactions.  If there is concern about a specific aspect of NAMA's work, it is within the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to scrutinise any aspect of it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already produced three special reports on NAMA's activities and they have been broadly positive in their assessment of how NAMA is managing its complex business. </p>  <p>  NAMA is also subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas, including the Public Accounts Committee.</p>  <p>  In addition, NAMA's clear and well stated policy is that properties and loans that are for sale are openly marketed.  This ensures a competitive and transparent sales process and the best possible financial return for the taxpayer. </p>  <p>  In relation to AIB, BOI and PTSB, which are publically listed companies, no basis has been established for their inclusion in the Investigation.  Each of these banks have an independent board and management teams with independent powers of decision which operate at arm's length to the State.  The board of each of these banks retains full responsibility and necessary authority for all of the operations and business of the banks in accordance with its legal, fiduciary and prudential duties to all stakeholders and for ensuring strict compliance with the regulatory and legal obligations of the bank.  </p>  <p>   Finally, it is important that I do not interfere with or prejudice the important work to be conducted by the Commission of Investigation, therefore, in these circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to comment further in respect of the Terms of Reference already approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p></reply>

The NPRF was a supplementary investment fund intended to support the Exchequer when budgetary pressures increased as a result of mounting pension costs. </p>  <p>  While the need for the State to provide for the cost of social welfare and public service pensions has not abated, the Government decided that fostering economic activity and employment through the establishment of the ISIF was the immediate priority.  This support for economic activity and employment puts the State in a better position to meet its pensions obligations in the longer-term. </p>  <p>  In relation to public sector pension costs, the steps this Government has taken in terms of introducing the Single Pensions Scheme will produce significant savings in the longer term.  In addition, there is expected to be a significant reduction in public sector pensions following the pay and pension cuts since 2009 and the freeze in pay and pension rates until after the Haddington Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  The most recent actuarial valuation of Public Service occupational pensions carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform estimated the total accrued liability at &euro;98bn as at December 2012.  This compares with the previous estimate of &euro;116bn for 2009 which was arrived at by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG).  Therefore, over the three years from 2009 to 2012 the liability fell by &euro;18bn or by 16%. </p>  <p>  At the time of the transition to the ISIF (end 2014) the total value of the NPRF including the Directed portfolio was &euro;22.2 billion.  As well as the issue of a broad restoration of the NPRF it must also be noted that under the provisions of the NPRF Act 2000 1% of GNP was payable from the Exchequer to the NPRF each year.  This would have meant a payment in the order of &euro;1.6 billion to the NPRF for 2014 requiring compensating fiscal adjustments elsewhere.  </p></reply>

The Central Bank intervened in this issue as information provided to customers, at point of sale, advertised some card protection benefits which were not needed i.e. liability for unauthorised use if a card was lost/stolen was covered by the card scheme and therefore, customers did not need additional insurance for this. </p>  <p>  The scheme commenced on 30 March 2015.  The credit card providers have been contacting impacted customers who should have received an explanatory letter and a claim form at this stage. Policyholders are required to sign and return the claim form to be considered for a refund of premiums paid since 1 August 2006 less any amounts paid to customer in respect of a previous claim. The policyholder is not required to demonstrate or articulate why they feel the policy was mis-sold to them but rather to sign and return the claim form.  Regardless of when customers purchased this product, they are entitled to claim redress for premiums paid on or after 1 August 2006, the date from which the Consumer Protection Code came into effect.  The maximum amount of compensation available equates to all premiums paid since 1 August 2006.  For those customers choosing to make a claim, their policy will be cancelled.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is currently progressing the amalgamation of the Offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman.  The question of the timeframe under which complaints can be reviewed is a policy matter which will be considered as the legislation to effect the amalgamation is being developed.  The issues in this regard are complex involving a range of considerations including the interface with the Statute of Limitations, existing consumer protection laws, complaints mechanisms and the availability of records. </p></reply>

While it is the case that I do not always agree with the outcome of the Council's analysis, I very much value their expertise and their input as an independent voice in helping the Government to adhere to its own fiscal targets. </p>  <p>  With regard to the future role, the Fiscal Council have a very specific remit.  Any additional responsibilities which have been suggested by some recently, would interfere with or dilute its primary mandate to monitor compliance with fiscal rules and comment publically on the Government's fiscal stance.  Also, it should be noted that the expertise of the Council Members is in macroeconomic and fiscal policy which enables the Council to fulfil its role specifically as a watchdog for budgetary planning and execution.</p></reply>

Given the scale of the State s investment some &euro;20.8 billion and the different financial instruments this money is invested in, there are a range of options available to recoup value from the bank and it is critical that we get these decisions right.  As a result Goldman Sachs International and William Fry are assisting the Department with this work by providing financial and legal advice respectively.  </p>  <p>  Reconfiguring the bank's capital structure, which is not longer fit for purpose given the new regulatory regime, is just the start of the process, but it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer.  Discussions commenced recently with the SSM (Single Supervisory Mechanism) and the Central Bank, AIB's regulators, regarding AIB's capital structure and this process is expected to take a number of months.  </p>  <p>  No decision has been made by the Government to sell any of our investments in AIB.  All options remain on the table and while I have said previously that an Initial Public Offering or IPO on the stock market, looks like the most likely exit route for the State, it is too early to specify what steps will be taken or to put a timeline on decisions.  Any sale will involve selling shares held by the ISIF.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated on numerous occasions, Government policy is that we will not remain a holder of our banking investments in the long term.  Given our high debt to GDP ratio, we do not have the luxury of holding all of these investments indefinitely and I envisage receipts from the gradual sale of these investments helping to play their part in reducing the State's overall debt burden in the coming years.</p></reply>

The Central Bank has written to each bank setting out new requirements that, inter alia,:</p><p>-  concluded sustainable solutions are in place for the vast majority of distressed borrowers by the end of 2015;</p><p>-  they meet the 'terms being met' target of 75 per cent of concluded solutions to the end of 2015 and beyond;</p><p>-  they continue to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears;</p><p>-  where they  take legal action that may result in loss of ownership for a borrower, they should be prepared to re-engage with the borrower and explore alternative solutions if the borrower re-engages; and</p><p>-  they engage fully and appropriately in the process set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.</p><p>I strongly believe that early constructive engagement by borrowers with their lender is the most effective way to avoid  family home repossession.  This is borne out by the most recent Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions statistical release for Q1 2015, which indicates that over 117,000 restructure arrangements have been put in place on primary dwelling homes (PDH) to the end of March and that over 85% of these are deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.</p></reply>

Up to 1 January 2012, principal contractors in the construction, meat processing and forestry sectors were obliged to submit to the Revenue Commissioners the details of relevant contracts entered into by those principals and their sub-contractors on a Form RCT1. Under the eRCT system, which came into effect as and from 1st January 2012, the Form RCT1 is no longer used but the same obligation on principal contractors remains albeit the information is now supplied electronically rather than in paper format.  </p>  <p>  Revenue's policing of the RCT regime has been significantly improved through a number or risk mitigation initiatives.  Firstly, the old RCT regime provided for the making of RCT repayments to sub-contractors on foot of a claim made by the sub-contractor.  This particular feature of the old regime was open to abuse and consequently the current RCT regime no longer provides for the making of repayments except in very exceptional cases.  Secondly, a VAT Reverse Charge mechanism introduced in 2008 places the responsibility for accounting for VAT on construction contracts on the principal contractor, thereby removing the risk of VAT non-compliance by the sub-contractor.</p>  <p>  I know that Revenue commits significant resources to compliance interventions in the construction sector.  There were over 15,000 tax compliance risk interventions in the Construction Sector in 2013 and nearly 17,000 such interventions in 2014.  In addition, Revenue works closely with the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Agency including conducting joint operations in the construction sector with both bodies.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-23a.88.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062300054#WRB03500"><p>As previously outlined in my response to Dail Question 26 on 7th May 2015, I am advised that the NAMA Chief Executive, in his opening address to the Public Accounts Committee on 18 December 2014, stated that NAMA is aiming to redeem a cumulative 80% (&euro;24 billion) of its Senior Bonds by the end of 2016 and that it hopes that it will have redeemed all of its Senior Bonds by the end of 2018.  He stated that these targets are predicated on conditions in the Irish market remaining favourable and on NAMA being in a position to retain sufficient specialist staff to enable it to generate the optimal financial return from the realisation of its residual loan portfolio.  NAMA has, to date, redeemed &euro;19.35bn, that is 64% of  the &euro;30.2bn Senior Bonds issued.  The current breakdown of the &euro;10.84bn outstanding NAMA Senior Bonds by holding institution is available on NAMA's website, <i>.</i></p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the NAMA Board has also undertaken to facilitate the timely and coherent delivery of key Grade A office space, retail and residential space within the Dublin Docklands strategic development zone and Dublin's Central Business District and to maximise the delivery of residential housing units in areas of most need.  Given that these commitments were agreed with NAMA only in July 2014, it is too early to speculate as what date in the future NAMA will have made sufficient progress on its objectives as to warrant consideration of its dissolution.</p><p>As regards accountability, it is important to point out that NAMA is already subject to a high level of public accountability compared to other commercial bodies, including commercial bodies in the State sector.</p><p>In carrying out its functions the Board of NAMA must comply with its obligations under the NAMA Act.  The NAMA Board comprises seven members, five of whom, including the Chairman, were Ministerial appointments.  The Chief Executive of NAMA and the Chief Executive of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) are ex-officio members of the Board.  The terms of office of Board members range between three and five years and no appointed member is eligible to serve more than two consecutive terms. </p><p>The NAMA Act (Section 18) sets out the principal responsibilities of the Board, which are</p><p>-  to ensure that NAMA discharges its functions efficiently and effectively;</p><p>-  to set strategic objectives and targets for NAMA;</p><p>-  to ensure that the appropriate systems and procedures are in place to achieve the strategic targets and objectives;</p><p>-  to take all reasonable steps available to it to achieve those targets and objectives.</p><p>The Board has also established four statutory committees, under Section 32 of the Act, to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities and obligations: Audit Committee, Credit Committee , Finance and Operating Committee, Risk Management Committee. </p><p>NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The level of disclosure in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements is comprehensive and professional.  I would encourage anyone interested in the workings and performance of NAMA who have not yet read these reports to take the time to do so as they are a rich source of information regarding NAMA's performance. </p><p>In addition, under Section 53 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is also required to submit to me an Annual Statement by 30 September each year setting out its proposed objectives for the following financial year, the scope of activities to be undertaken, its strategies and policies and its proposed use of resources.  I am obliged to lay these statements before the Oireachtas and I endeavour to do so on a timely basis. </p><p>NAMA is also required to report to me on a quarterly basis giving detailed information about its loans, its financing arrangements and its income and expenditure.  These reports, which also include other information specified under Section 55 of the NAMA Act, track NAMA's progress on a quarterly basis.  I am obliged to lay these reports before the Oireachtas and I endeavour to do so on a timely basis. </p><p>The Chairman and Chief Executive are also accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) and other Oireachtas committees and to give evidence to those committees whenever required to do so.  Furthermore, there have been numerous Parliamentary Questions addressed to me on NAMA-related issues and the associated replies are on the Oireachtas record.  </p><p>NAMA's accounts are comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has a permanent team of officers based in the Agency with unrestricted access to all its records and files.  If there is concern about a specific aspect of NAMA's work, it is within the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to scrutinise any aspect of it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already produced three special reports on NAMA's activities and they have been broadly positive in their assessment of how NAMA is managing its complex business.  </p><p>In mid 2014, my officials also produced a special report on NAMA's activities in compliance with Section 227 of the Act.  This report assessed the extent to which NAMA has made progress toward achieving its overall objectives and whether the continuation of NAMA is necessary having regard to the purposes of the Act.  This report concluded that NAMA has made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives; and based on its performance and financial projections in light of the strength of current investor interest in Ireland, NAMA is well positioned to achieve its overall objectives and so continues to be necessary.</p><p>NAMA also recently became subject to the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, 2014 on 14th April 2015.  As you will be aware, the FOI Act provides that every person has the following rights:</p><p>-  right to access records held by FOI bodies listed in the Act;</p><p>-  right to have personal information amended or deleted where such information is incomplete, incorrect or misleading; and</p><p>-  right for a person to be given reasons for a decision taken by FOI bodies that affects that person.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, NAMA operates a dedicated email address, , to enable TDs and Senators to raise any matter directly with the Agency.  I would encourage the Deputy, and indeed any member of the Oireachtas with a NAMA-related query, to avail of the email service. I am assured by NAMA that all matters which are brought to its attention via this forum are fully, and promptly, responded to.</p><p>Against this backdrop, I do not accept that there is a need to make NAMA more accountable than is already the case. </p></reply>

Notwithstanding this position, my officials do take an active interest in how the bank's cost base evolves to ensure that the State's interests as shareholder are protected and to ensure that the Government's remuneration policy is enforced.  </p>  <p>  The bank has previously indicated that as part of its restructuring plan to reduce costs and increase efficiencies, outsourcing of certain functions would be considered in consultation with unions and affected staff.  I have also been informed by the bank that there have  been no compulsory redundancies as a result of its recent outsourcing activities.  Any staff who transfer under outsourcing arrangements transfer under the TUPE regulations.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that AIB has not at this stage confirmed any agreement to outsource some of its technology services in Application and Development Management teams to a third party provider.  Should any such decision be confirmed, then affected staff will be informed immediately and AIB will enter into a full process of information and consultation with employee representatives, as required both by law and under engagement principles agreed with the Irish Bank Officials Association (IBOA).</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution. This includes decisions in relation to product interest rates as determined by the banks from time to time.  </p><p>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Central Bank publication &quot;Retail Interest Rate Statistics: April 2015&quot;, available at <i></i></p><p>The publication notes that &quot;new business rates in excess of 6 per cent are observed in sectors such as construction and financial intermediation, while rates as low as 3.18 per cent are applicable to the Electricity &amp;amp; Gas sector.  Rates applicable to financial intermediation sector can be diverse owing to the nature of the entities involved. In general, SME lending rates are consistently higher for new business when compared to outstanding amounts.  This variance is most notable in the construction and financial intermediation sectors.&quot;</p><p>However, it should be noted that in the most recent SME credit demand survey covering the six month period to March 2015, only 1% of SMEs that did not demand credit thought that it was too expensive to borrow.  The same survey notes that, among those SMEs with outstanding loans, the average cost of credit across all outstanding loans is 3.9%.  This is down slightly from 4% in September 2014. 36% of SMEs with outstanding loans report a very low cost of credit between 0-2%, while the majority (61%) have an average cost of credit of between 3-10%.</p><p>In addition, the lower cost funding by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) should act as a catalyst for downward pressure on interest rates by fostering greater competition in the marketplace.  The establishment of the SBCI is a further important step to help Irish businesses, and the crucial SME sector in particular, to grow and contribute further to our economic recovery.</p><p>This creates positive competitive pressure in the banking infrastructure, encouraging new entrants while also pushing existing financial providers to better meet the needs of their clients.</p></reply>

The second Greek programme is due to expire next week; important repayments are due in the short and medium term; and outflows from the Greek banks have been very significant, leading to regular increases in the level of ELA support from the ECB. </p>  <p>  The Greek government has forwarded new proposals which are now being intensively analysed by the institutions &ndash; the European Commission, ECB, IMF and Eurogroup &ndash; and being discussed with Greek Ministers and experts.  First reactions have been generally to the effect that there has been an important step forward and there is a real basis on which to work.  </p>  <p>  The Euro Summit gave the Greek Prime Minister the chance to set out his approach directly to all partners and allowed him to appreciate the sense of purpose and determination among his colleagues. </p>  <p>  I stressed the importance of developing trust and of implementing policies which can credibly meet the scale of the challenges.  I outlined our own experiences, including of modifying aspects of our Programme which we sought to replace with others.  These are also points I have made to Prime Minister Tsipras during our bilateral contacts in the margins of other European Council meetings.</p>  <p>  The Eurogroup is now scheduled to meet again tomorrow evening with a view to reaching agreement by Thursday morning.  I hope that at the European Council later that day we can salute an important breakthrough &ndash; even if much work will still remain to be done with Greece on longer-term issues. </p>  <p>  In relation to the separate issue of Ireland&rsquo;s debt, I would note that the Government has achieved significant improvements in the terms of our EU/IMF programme loans since they were initially agreed in late 2010. </p>  <p>  The savings arising from these changes can be broken down into two elements, cash savings and a reduction in our borrowing requirement over a period of time.</p>  <p>  In 2011, we reached agreement to reduce the cost of our EFSF loans. Similar reductions were subsequently agreed for our interest rates on the loans provided by the EFSM and by our three bilateral lenders.  It is estimated that these interest rate reductions are worth around 9 billion euro over the initially envisaged 7&frac12; year term.</p>  <p>  These interest rate reductions, and more recently the early repayment of a large portion &ndash; up to 18.3 billion euro - of our IMF loans, mean that we have negotiated real cash savings of over 10 billion euro.</p>  <p>  Also in 2011, the average maturity of our EFSM and the EFSF loans was extended to 12.5 and 15 years respectively, and a further extension of up to 7 years was agreed in 2013. This has smoothed our redemption profile, improving long-term debt sustainability, and has had a positive effect on the cost of Exchequer borrowing. </p>  <p>  The extension of maturities and the subsequent replacement of the Promissory Notes issued to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) with a series of longer term Government bonds reduce the State's borrowing requirement by over 40 billion euro over the next decade, thus significantly improving the viability of the State's finances.</p></reply>

The joint declaration issued after the Summit reaffirms our collective commitment to protecting the global climate for future generations and our collective will to reach a binding agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The declaration acknowledges the differentiated levels of responsibility and capability between countries and regions but notes that a shared responsibility to take action on climate change exists and that a concerted effort should be made to reach an agreement to reduce emissions so that global temperature increases are limited to below 2&deg;C. </p><p>Energy was also discussed in the context of climate change.  The Action Plan adopted at the Summit committed to improving energy efficiency, realising energy savings, improving accessibility, developing and deploying renewable energies and promoting increased energy interconnection.</p><p>Ireland has a strong track record on tackling climate change and we will continue to play our role, including as part of the EU contribution to the global effort to address climate change. In this regard, we are encouraging all countries to provide their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to contribute to the success of the COP 21 meetings in Paris at the end of this year.</p><p>Attached are the Political Declaration of the Summit entitled &ldquo;A Partnership for the Next Generation&rdquo; and the Action Plan agreed at the Summit.</p></reply>

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be accessed by anyone.  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network. </p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers.  </p>  <p>  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  </p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office.  This option will remain on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish.  I also want to emphasise that the department continuously reviews its forms to ensure that they are amenable and relevant to all customers. In order to ensure that the department&rsquo;s forms present payment options equally, I have asked the department to update them to ensure that a neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided and to also ensure that one payment option is not favoured over another.</p>  <p>  The Department is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.  The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

Approximately 19,800 are expected to transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, 4,100 to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) and 5,500 to a re-rated family income supplement (FIS).</p>  <p>  The 5,500 customers already on FIS will have their payment automatically increased to take account of the loss of 60% of their OFP income and have received letters to that effect.  All remaining customers were invited to attend information sessions in their local Intreo offices where they were advised of the different options available to them when they transition from the OFP scheme.  At these information sessions, staff of the Department informed lone parents that the most financially advantageous option available to them was to work a minimum of 19 hours per week and claim FIS. </p>  <p>  On foot of these information sessions, estimates suggest that to date over 1,250 of these lone parents have become first time FIS recipients.  This means these individuals have either taken up employment or have increased their existing hours of employment to claim FIS. </p>  <p>   The 1,250 lone parents who are new FIS recipients are now financially better off than when they were claiming the one-parent family payment.  These customers will also qualify for the new back to work family dividend (BTWFD) from 2 July.  The Dividend is worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year and reducing to 50% entitlement worth &euro;775 per child in the second year.</p>  <p>  Approximately 5,000 of the customers transitioning from OFP in July are also in receipt of the rent supplement.  These customers will be able to have their supplement reviewed on foot of the changes in their overall income.  Where a customer has incurred an overall loss this review may result in an increase in their rent supplement and likewise for customers who gain overall their rent supplement may be reduced, assuming their circumstances have not otherwise changed.  It is important to note that rent supplement  is a means tested payment and is calculated to ensure that the person&rsquo;s income, after the payment of their rent, is equal to the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution.  The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household.  </p>  <p>  Child care policy, including the delivery and/or expansion of child care services, is the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA).</p>  <p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme have highlighted the need for child care supports to be available for lone parents who make the transition into employment.  My Department in conjunction with the DCYA introduced the after-school child care scheme and the community employment childcare programme in 2013 and 2014 respectively.  Both of these schemes were funded by my Department from savings from the child benefit scheme and build on the 25,000 subsidised childcare places provided by the DCYA each year. </p>  <p>  The DCYA has also established an inter-Departmental group at senior level to carry out an economic and cost-benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility, and affordability of quality child care, including early years and school-age care.  This group is led by the DCYA and includes representatives from a number of Departments including the Department of Social Protection.  It is due to report this summer.</p></reply>

In the case of disability allowance, the first &euro;50,000 is disregarded, while in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;5,000 is disregarded. </p><p>In the case of persons under 66 in receipt of disability allowance or the blind pension, the proceeds derived from the sale of the principal private residence can be disregarded, subject to an upper limit of &euro;190,500.  These are the same arrangements as for recipients of the state pension non-contributory (SPNC), and social welfare legislation provides that this disregard applies &ldquo;<i>when the claimant or beneficiary disposes of his or her principal residence for the purposes of:</i></p><p><i>(i) purchasing alternative accommodation which is or will be occupied by him or her as his or her only or main residence,</i></p><p><i>(ii) funding the renting of alternative accommodation which is or will be occupied by him or her as his or her only main residence,</i></p><p><i>(iii) funding the payment of fees to a nursing home which has been registered in accordance with section 4 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 (No. 23 of 1990),</i></p><p><i>(iv) residing with a carer, as defined in section 99 or section 179, who is in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit or carer&rsquo;s allowance in respect of the care and attention provided to the claimant or beneficiary, or</i></p><p><i>(v) residing in accommodation suitable for elderly persons which incorporates communal and support facilities and which is provided by a body approved by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the purposes of section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 (No. 18 of 1992)</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>The current arrangements reflect the fact that older people and people with long-term disabilities may have sell their principal residence to move to more suitable alternative accommodation including moving to a nursing home or to live with a carer.  It is not considered appropriate to apply similar arrangements to other means tested claimants aged under 66 such as recipients of jobseeker's allowance.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;27.9 million for the ENP scheme in 2015. </p>  <p>  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment under the ENP scheme. The scheme is means tested and payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p>  <p>  Any savings or other capital that an applicant may have will be taken into consideration by the officer administering the scheme when determining if the applicant has sufficient funds to meet the particular need to which the application refers to.  There is no maximum balance of allowable savings provided for in the legislation or guidelines governing the ENP scheme. The guidelines state that where an applicant has capital resources s/he should normally be expected to provide for the need from that source. </p>  <p>  Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP under the SWA scheme should contact the Department. </p></reply>

Customer engagement was entirely voluntary with no negative consequences for customers who chose not to respond or engage.

The Department has no plans to issue further letters at this stage.</p>  <p>  Increasing the scale by which State payments are delivered directly into a client account is a key objective of a number of Government policies.  These include the National Payments Plan, the Department&rsquo;s Payment Strategy, the Public Sector Reform Plan, the e-Government Strategy and other government policies.  These policies support improved customer service, reflect consumer trends and preferences and can deliver administrative savings. </p>  <p>  The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.  The Department&rsquo;s support for An Post is equally apparent.  We anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for the cash payment services to welfare customers.</p></reply>

It provides that information held by another Government Department or a public body which is required for the purposes of the Act or the control of schemes may be transferred to the Department.</p><p>In one such exchange, information was provided by Revenue on persons who had paid Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) and it was clear from the interest received that they had significant amounts of capital invested whilst being in receipt of means-tested social welfare payment.

It is an important preventative and detection control measure.  The Department continues to examine its control practices and to introduce new measures to improve controls, wherever possible.  The aim is to reduce or eliminate overpayments arising from customers receiving payments when they are no longer eligible in order to ensure that scarce resources are available to those who need them most.</p></reply>

The purpose of these meetings was to exchange of views on Greece and clarify the positions and the situation in the ongoing talks between the Greek authorities and the Institutions. </p><p>A revised list of counter proposals was submitted by the Greek authorities yesterday leaving no time to assess them prior to the meetings.  The Greek authorities will now work with the Institutions to agree a comprehensive list of reforms and a list of prior actions by tomorrow that can be presented to the Eurogroup. </p><p>The euro area has an obligation to Greece in these difficult times but Greece has an obligation to itself, it needs to reform the economy and return it to sustainable growth.</p><p>Ireland, together with the other Member States, understands and empathises with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  This is why there has been a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new Government, while also respecting existing commitments.</p><p>Even at this very late stage, there is still time for a deal to be agreed - but Greece must put reasonable proposals on the table.  It is still in everyone's interest that agreement is reached.  We have already seen backtracking on previous reforms and this is unacceptable.  The Member States and institutions are working in good faith - Greece must do so also.</p><p>The situation of Greece's finances is very challenging with immediate financing needs to be addressed.  In addition, deposit outflows have continued from the banking system.  Therefore, urgent agreement on the necessary structural reforms is imperative to conclude the 5th review and release the associated disbursements.</p><p>Direct trade and financial linkage between Ireland and Greece are small, therefore the risk to the Irish economy are second round in nature.  If turbulence in Greece results in a slowdown in the EU economy then this could have a knock effect on the Irish economy given our openness to trade.</p><p>As a Union, we are now in a much better place than when the crisis hit.  In recent months, financial markets in Greece have been adversely affected through declines in the stock market, capital outflows and increases in bond yields, although markets appear to be treating Greece as an outlier rather than a source of contagion.  This is encouraging and suggests the firewalls created and the governance changes made during the crisis appear to be having the desired effect.</p></reply>

One of these, action point number 4, asked that the barriers to housing mobility be examined and recommendations made.  In line with the timescale set out, a report on the barriers to housing mobility was prepared and, in accordance with their co-ordination requirements for the overall strategy, this was submitted to the Department of An Taoiseach.  The identified key barriers affecting housing mobility were weak consumer confidence, high levels of unemployment, build-up of unsold stock, supply constraints in the greater Dublin area and other urban centres, negative equity, mortgage arrears and tracker mortgages.</p>  <p>  A key conclusion was that market mobility should improve as the wider economy recovers and that this would have a positive effect on some of the main housing mobility barriers that were identified.  In that regard, although there continues to be a need for caution and for the maintenance of sound overall economic policies, there have been some positive developments.  In particular unemployment has fallen from 11.7% in May 2014 to 9.8% in May 2015 and the amount of new mortgage credit issued in Q1 2015 was &euro;983 million compared to &euro;568 million in Q1 2014.  It was also recommended that key data in this area should continue to be monitored and should, where appropriate, form part of the rationale for policy proposals to implement Construction 2020.</p></reply>

CMU, through a wide ranging series of measures, aims to make EU capital markets more integrated, liquid and competitive.</p>  <p>  Its ultimate purpose is to increase resilience of the financial system and provide greater opportunities for SME's, particularly high growth SME's, and longer term infrastructure projects.</p>  <p>  From an Irish perspective CMU could serve to significantly increase issuer and investor access to more liquid European markets and, in so doing, enable our companies to expand and create employment.</p>  <p>  The development of CMU is considered to offer good potential for fast growth SME's, some of whom have been constrained in recent years due to lack of funding from traditional funding sources.  Ireland's particular focus will be on what the Capital Markets Union can do for SME's and for smaller markets. </p>  <p>  In its green paper on the Capital Markets Union, the Commission identified a number of goals which it feels should be prioritised in the short term.  These include bringing forward a proposal on "Simple, Transparent and Standardised Securitisation" and a review of the Prospectus Directive.  The Department supports these short term priorities of the CMU initiative as they have the potential to benefit SME's directly and indirectly.</p>  <p>  A potential benefit to revitalising securitisation markets is that it may free up bank balance sheets to enable more lending to SME's.</p>  <p>  A review of the Prospectus Directive has the potential to encourage smaller issuances by establishing more proportionate rules.</p>  <p>  One of the key priorities of the CMU project is to develop alternative modes of funding.  A number of initiatives have been suggested including:</p>  <p> - Crowd-funding, which offers good potential to make a meaningful contribution to the financing needs of SME's.  We would support the EU playing a role to develop this sector, for example in conducting research on best practice.  We believe that enhancing the potential contribution of crowd-funding would complement the range of measures already undertaken at a domestic level aimed at supporting SME's.</p>  <p> - Developing the quality of SME credit information has the potential to further the funding opportunities available to SMEs.  If SMEs are to become attractive propostions to investors it is necessary that there is good quality and comparable information available on them and I welcome the signal in the European Commission's Green Paper that there will be something done in this area. </p>  <p> - SME growth markets provide a valuable platform for SME's to source funding as the administrative demands and costs are far lower than they would be for admission to trading on a regulated market.</p>  <p>  The Commission is scheduled to publish an action plan in September 2015 in which it will set out the legislative proposals or market led initiatives it intends to pursue in the short and long term to advance the CMU initiative.  The Government will continue in its active engagement as these proposals take shape, to ensure that the interests of SME's remain embedded within the CMU initiative.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-23a.319.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062300059#WRG00400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 220 together.</p><p>In response to the Deputy's question the Moriarty Tribunal made a number of recommendations which affected a number of Government Departments.  As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.</p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.  Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.  This Government has undertaken a number of significant reforms since the financial crisis towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the Irish financial services sector and to respond to the shortcomings identified.  </p><p>In 2011 the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. </p><p>Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad.  It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. </p><p>The reforms introduced under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 are complemented by a number of strategically important reforms at EU level in financial services.  Under our presidency, agreement was reached on the single supervisory mechanism, one of the main cornerstones of Banking Union which will provide for the European Central Bank to act as supervisor for systemic important banks throughout the Union.  Agreement was also reached on the Capital Requirements package which will ensure that European banks hold enough good quality capital to withstand future economic and financial shocks.  These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels.  The Central Bank of Ireland's Enforcement Priorities for 2015 highlight the importance of enforcement within its risk-based regulatory framework (PRISM).  PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland.  The Central Bank's Strategic Plan 2013 2015 also sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.</p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations.  Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted.  Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted.  These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the following information in relation to Revenue issues raised in the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners</b></p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments.  This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders</b></p><p>In relation to this proposal, I remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform.  Representations are a valid part of the political process.  The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements</b></p><p>This recommendation has been considered.  These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission.  However if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further.  The Deputy will appreciate that Revenue is not in a position to comment on matters relating to individuals for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality.</p></reply>

Firstly it requires banks (as per the BRRD rules) to hold a significant level of loss absorption capacity in order to ensure as far as possible that shareholders and creditors are capable of covering any losses that arise should they get into  financial difficulties.  This means that in a resolution scenario bondholders will be bailed in, where necessary in accordance with the resolution hierarchy. Secondly, it provides  for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF).  The target level of the SRF is 1% of covered deposits of participating Member States which is equal to approximately &euro;55bn and which is required to be reached within eight years.  The fund will be paid for by contributions from the banking sectors of the participating Member States.  Irish banks including international banks operating out of this country are expected to pay in the region of about &euro;1.8bn towards this target level i.e. about &euro;225m a year.  It should be noted that these figures are still quite approximate.   </p>  <p>  The SRF where needed will be used after the bail-in process has been exhausted and there are still losses to be absorbed. During the initial eight years (transition period), the SRF will be compartmentalised in order to facilitate its progressive mutualisation.  The contributions of banks will be paid into their national compartment, and should one of them get into financial trouble, then this compartment will be the first port of call for funding, where needed.  However funding if required will also be  available from the other compartments, and as the transitional period passes, more money will be taken from the other national compartments and less from the compartment of the affected Member State, until at the end of the transition period, the SRF has become fully mutualised.  </p>  <p>   The major implication for Irish banks is that the progressive mutualisation of the SRF should go a long way towards breaking their link with the sovereign, and thus enable them be evaluated by the market on their own underlying commercial merits.</p></reply>

The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks. </p>  <p>  I outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.  There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.</p>  <p>  The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.  Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers. </p>  <p>  In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks.  This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates. </p>  <p>  The position of home owners who are in negative equity was also discussed and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will review progress over the coming weeks and a follow up set of meeting with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the Budget.</p></reply>

Under the Directive, financial institutions in each Member State will be required to report financial account information to the tax administration including account balances; information on interest, dividends and other similar income; and gross proceeds from the sale of financial assets.  Tax administrations will then exchange this information, where it relates to account holders who are residents of other Member States, with the other Member States concerned. </p><p>Legislation to implement this Directive will be introduced later this year, with due diligence in relation to tax residence and tax identification numbers (TIN's) for new accounts due to begin on 1 January 2016.  Exchange of information in relation to account information for 2016 is due to commence in 2017.  The reporting will be more extensive than the current requirements under the EU Savings Directive, which relate only to interest income.  The EU Savings Directive will be superseded by the new Directive - DAC2 - and will be phased out accordingly.  Implementation of DAC2 will greatly enhance the capacity of tax administrations to tackle the challenge of cross-border tax evasion. </p><p>In addition, the European Union and Switzerland signed an agreement last month, which provides for the automatic exchange of financial account information and is aimed at improving international tax compliance.  It upgrades a 2004 agreement that required Switzerland to apply withholding tax to interest payments, in line with the option adopted by some Member States under the EU Savings Directive (in preference to exchange of information).  Under the new agreement, the EU and Switzerland will automatically exchange information on the financial accounts of each other's residents, starting in 2018.  The aim is to address situations where a taxpayer seeks to hide amounts representing income or capital gains in respect of which tax has not been paid.</p><p>The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended (the &quot;CJA 2010&quot;), implements Ireland's EU anti-money laundering obligations.  The CJA 2010 requires Irish banks to identify and verify customers and in addition, where a customer is a non-resident PEP, the CJA 2010 requires the bank to always determine the source of wealth and the source of funds of any transaction the customer wishes the bank to carry out.</p><p>The Central Bank has advised me that, in light of the reference to tax evaders, it should be noted that a bank, including any employee or officer of the bank, who knows, suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect on the basis of information obtained in the course of carrying on their business, that another person has been engaged in an offence of money laundering or terrorist financing, shall report that knowledge or suspicion to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners, as soon as practicable after acquiring that knowledge or forming that suspicion.</p><p><b>Actions to address Banks &quot;selling bad products to retail customers&quot;</b></p><p>Directive 2008/48/EDC on Credit Agreements for Consumers is a harmonised Directive that ensures that all consumers in the EU enjoy a high and equivalent level of protection of their interests, enabling them to make their decision about consumer credit in full knowledge of its costs and conditions as well as their rights and obligations. </p><p>This Directive was transposed in Ireland by SI 281 of 2010 European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulation 2010.  </p><p>The Regulations give effect to the provisions of Directive 2008/48/EC on Credit Agreements for Consumers (the 'CDD') and the scope includes credit agreements where the loan amounts are between &euro;200 and &euro;75,000.  Part II of the Regulations set outs the information and practices preliminary to conclusion of credit agreements.  Regulation 11 sets out the obligation on creditors to assess creditworthiness of consumers on the basis of sufficient information, where appropriate obtained from the consumer, and where necessary, on the basis of a consultation of the relevant database. </p><p>Directive 2014/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property (the Mortgage Credit Directive) is to be transposed by 21 March 2016.  As referred to in recital 4 of the Mortgage Credit Directive, the Directive is designed to address 'a series of problems that were identified in mortgage markets within the Union relating to irresponsible lending and borrowing and the potential scope for irresponsible behaviour by market participants'.  The Mortgage Credit Directive places an obligation on creditors to assess the creditworthiness of the consumer before concluding a credit agreement (Article 18).  Article 18 states that the assessment of creditworthiness 'shall take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer to meet his obligations under the credit agreement'.  </p><p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) is expected to publish final guidelines on product oversight and governance (guidelines) later in 2015.  These guidelines provide a framework for robust and responsible design and distribution of retail banking products (e.g. mortgage loans, deposits, payment accounts, payment services and electronic money), and in this regard, seek to avoid future cases of consumer detriment.  In particular, the guidelines provide that 'manufacturers' of retail banking products (including credit institutions) should consider the needs of their customers when designing and bringing products to the market and also requires such firms to review these products over their life cycle to ensure they continue to meet the interests, objectives and characteristics of the target market for which they were intended.  It is expected that these guidelines will be implemented in January 2017.</p></reply>

This included a reference to the distributional consequences of monetary policy by penalising savers to the benefit of debtors and through asset price increases which may disproportionately favour the wealthy and increase inequality.</p><p>Let me firstly point out that Mr Draghi also highlighted the distributional effects from monetary policy inaction as well as action.</p><p>The Expanded Asset Purchase Programme (EAPP), launched on 9 March 2015, is aimed at fulfilling the ECB's price stability mandate.  Asset purchases provide monetary stimulus to the economy in a context where key ECB interest rates are effectively at the lower bound.  They should further ease monetary and financial conditions.  They should also help to support investment and consumption, and ultimately contribute to a return of inflation rates which are close to 2 per cent.</p><p>Ireland should benefit from quantitative easing in a number of ways:</p><p>- Through improved financing conditions for households and firms; </p><p>- By raising demand in the euro area, Ireland's single largest export destination; </p><p>- Through the depreciation of the currency which improves the competitiveness of Irish exports outside the euro area;</p><p>- Through the restoration of price stability which will help reduce the real debt burden. </p><p>While quantitative easing will likely be beneficial for the Irish economy, there is nevertheless the possibility of side effects such as increased asset prices which will benefit the owners of these assets. </p><p>In this regard, I would point out that Capital Gains Tax applies on any chargeable gain from the disposal of many assets, including non-principal private residences and to equity gains.  Stamp Duty also applies to the purchase of assets such as property and shares.  Therefore, in the event of increases in asset values, there would be a proportionate increase in the tax paid. </p><p>Finally, I would point out that all tax rates and regimes are held under continuous review by my Department and that any changes are made in the context of the annual budgetary cycle, including the Finance Bill.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-23a.341.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062300059#WRG02600"><p>The Fiscal Assessment Report published recently by the Council is being considered by my officials.  As is normal, a comprehensive response to all of the pertinent issues will be published in the coming weeks.  I will however, give my initial views on a significant issue raised by the Council.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, from 2016 onwards, the public finances in Ireland will be subject to the requirements of the preventive arm of the SGP.  The European Commission assesses compliance with the preventive arm on the basis of two complimentary pillars.  First is the minimum annual improvement in the structural balance and the second is compliance with the expenditure benchmark.  The minimum improvement in the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark are in theory designed to be complementary, although differences between the two metrics can emerge from time to time.</p>  <p>  The Fiscal Council noted that the fiscal projections contained in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) did not show Ireland complying with our requirements under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP); in other words, that the improvement in our structural balance is below the required 0.6 percentage points in 2016. </p>  <p>  However, SPU estimates show that for Ireland compliance with the expenditure benchmark is consistent with delivering a lower suggested quantum of structural adjustment in 2016.  This somewhat counterintuitive outcome was explicitly addressed in the SPU, and emphasises the material problems posed by some of the technical aspects of the rules.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that compliance with the requirements of the SGP is ultimately assessed on the basis of analysis undertaken by the European Commission.  In this context, the recent assessment of the SPU published by the European Commission as part of the European Semester process finds that 'on the basis of information in the 2015 Stability Programme Update recalculated according to the common methodology, progress towards the MTO is in line with the requirements of the preventive arm of the [Stability and Growth] Pact.  The assessment by the Commission also finds that 'the rate of expenditure growth net of discretionary revenue measures, as planned in the SPU, is expected to be in line with the requirements of the expenditure benchmark pillar'.  In summary, therefore, the projections in the SPU are consistent with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>  <p>  While I will address other issues comprehensively in my formal response to the Council, I would strongly make the point that when formulating Budget 2016, the Government are acutely aware of the importance of adhering to the fiscal rules and our fiscal policy will reflect this.</p></reply>

The application would be made on the basis that the interest income concerned is being returned to the beneficial recipient's tax authority and is being fully taxed.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested by the Deputy is not recorded on Revenue's systems.  However there is no record that any non-deduction certificates have been issued by Large Cases Division, which deals with high net worth individuals, for an account in the jurisdictions listed by the Deputy.  While the Commissioners consider it unlikely that such certificates were issued by other Revenue Divisions, they will check in that regard and correspond directly with the Deputy.</p></reply>

The allowances were originally available for qualifying expenditure incurred in the five-year period commencing on 25 March 2002.  The termination date was extended to 31 July 2008 in Finance Act 2006 but the amount of qualifying expenditure was restricted to 75% of that incurred in the period from 25 March 2007 to 31 December 2007 and to 50% of that incurred in the period 1 January 2008 to 31 July 2008.

Where the contracts were entered into before that date, the termination date remained at 31 July 2008 with qualifying expenditure being subject to the 75% and 50% caps on expenditure.  Although an extended termination date to 30 April 2010 applies, there is a further restriction on qualifying expenditure.  Qualifying expenditure was reduced to 50% of that actually incurred in the case of individuals and to 75% in the case of companies. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department carried out a review of the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) in advance of the last Budget. As a result of the review, I extended the EII to include the management and operation of nursing homes for 3 years, subject to approval from the European Commission.  It is not possible to provide a timeframe for receipt of the Commission's approval but my officials will be engaging closely with the Commission to ensure that it can be provided as soon as possible.  Finally, I would advise the Deputy that registered private nursing homes are exempt from the Local Property Tax.</p></reply>

It must not be forgotten that the USC replaced two other charges, namely the Health levy and the Income levy. I am cognisant of how unpopular the USC is but given that it raises over &euro;4 billion per annum for the Exchequer, it is difficult to see how it could be abolished without the imposition of additional taxation elsewhere or through equivalent cuts in expenditure.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, as a result of the changes to income tax and USC in Budget 2015, all those who currently pay income tax and/or USC have seen a reduction in their tax bill this year compared to 2014 where incomes are equal. Furthermore, the Government has committed to continue to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners in the coming years, contingent on having the fiscal space to do so. </p><p>The rates of USC and the rate bands are set out in the chart:<table><tr><th>Standard rate of USC</th><th>2015</th><th>2014 - 2012</th><th>2011</th></tr><tr><td>Exemption Limit</td><td>&euro;12,012</td><td>&euro;10,036</td><td>&euro;4,004</td></tr><tr><td>1.5%</td><td>First &euro;12,012</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>2%</td><td>N/A</td><td>First &euro;10,036</td><td>First &euro;10,036</td></tr><tr><td>3.5%</td><td>Next &euro;5,564</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>4%</td><td>N/A</td><td>Next &euro;5,980</td><td>Next &euro;5,980</td></tr><tr><td>7%</td><td>Next &euro;52,468</td><td>Balance</td><td>Balance</td></tr><tr><td>8%</td><td>Balance</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr></table></p><p>* There is a surcharge of 3% USC on individuals who have non-PAYE income that exceeds &euro;100,000 in a year, regardless of age.</p><p>** Medical card holders whose aggregate income does not exceed &euro;60,000 now pay a maximum rate of 3.5% USC.</p><p>*** Individuals aged 70 years and over whose aggregate income is &euro;60,000 or less now pay a maximum rate of 3.5% USC.</p></reply>

The total amount retained by Revenue from VAT collected on behalf of other Member States in relation to Q1 2015 is &euro;25.9m.</p></reply>

For the Deputies information "significant pyritic damage" includes properties that are certified as having a Damage Condition Rating of '2' or a Damage Condition Rating of '1' with progression. </p>  <p>  The Regulations also specify the assessment methodology that must be applied to confirm the presence of significant pyrite damage and the type of certification that must be produced before an exemption from LPT can be granted (IS 398-1-2013).This is the only type of certification that is relevant under current legislation and the Revenue Commissioners have no discretion to apply an exemption from LPT on foot of any other type of supporting documentation.   </p>  <p>  In regard to the specific cases mentioned by the Deputies in Questions 24829-15 and 25084-15, I am advised that the property owners in question have not produced the required certificates confirming 'significant pyritic damage' and for that reason the Revenue Commissioners are prohibited by law from applying LPT exemptions to the relevant properties. </p>  <p>  The Deputies may be aware that I have initiated a review of the operation of LPT. The review is being conducted by Dr Don Thornhill and is due to be presented to me no later than summer 2015.</p>  <p>  The review will primarily have regard to recent residential property price developments, the overall yield from LPT and the desirability of achieving relative stability in LPT payments. It will however also address a number of matters relating to the administration of LPT, including the operation of the pyrite exemption provisions. </p>  <p>  A resolution to the pyrite issues may necessitate a change in the relevant provisions of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) and/or the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations. If it is the case that legislative change is required, then I will examine the possibilities for its advance application on an administrative basis with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  However, pending any decisions in relation to the statutory provisions, the Revenue Commissioners have an obligation to act in accordance with section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), which requires that an LPT exemption can only apply where the residential property has been assessed and a relevant certificate confirming "significant pyritic damage" has issued to the property owner.</p></reply>

This process concluded on Friday 12 June 2015.  While this Directive provides less flexibility in transposition to Member States than the previous Directive governing the DGS, Article 13 provides some discretion for Member States on the calculation of contributions to the DGS where a lower level of contribution for low risk sectors which, if justified, could be put in place.

This includes the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, borrowers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities will be protected by the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 when it is enacted.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loan.  This Bill will require entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct. Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. </p>  <p>  The Bill was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February. The Bill is continuing its progress through the legislative process. The Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il on 17 June and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Second Stage in the Seanad tomorrow (24 June). </p>  <p>  In addition, I need to be clear that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the contract.</p>  <p>  I should say that the Central Bank does not have specific data on banks which no longer operate in the country as opposed to non-bank lenders. </p>  <p>  According to the Central Bank's Statistical Release of 4 June 2015, by the end of March 2015, non-bank entities accounted for 5.1 per cent of all outstanding mortgage loans (6.3 per cent in value terms). </p>  <p>  The Release noted that non-bank lenders now hold almost 46,000 mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses (PDH) and buy-to-let (BTL) combined. Of this number, 19,818, are in arrears on more than 90 days. </p>  <p>  In addition, the ESRI in its recent Quarterly Economic Commentary has noted that the number of households in negative equity is falling. </p>  <p>  In relation to interest rates, as the Deputy will be aware, I met with senior management of Ireland's six main mortgage providers in May and outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high. There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.</p>  <p>  In addition, I outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks. This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how customers can take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates.</p></reply>

Lending restrictions are, in most cases, intended to be short-term in nature and kept in place until the credit union has addressed the issues giving rise to the particular concerns.</p><p>Almost all credit unions with a lending restriction in place have a maximum individual loan size restriction. In the majority of cases, the maximum individual loan size is in excess of &euro;10,000 as detailed in the table below. <table><tr><th><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>As at 19 June 2015</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Maximum Loan Size Restriction</td><td>Number of Credit Unions</td></tr><tr><td>0-&euro;9,999</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;10,000-&euro;19,999</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000-&euro;29,999</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000-&euro;39,999</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;40,000 and above</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>183</td></tr></table></p><p>In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, may apply for a review of their lending restriction. A communication has been issued to all relevant credit unions outlining the process for the review of lending restrictions and requested them to indicate by 31 March 2015 whether they intend making an application for a review of their lending restriction or not. The closing date for receipt of applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative is 30 September 2015.</p><p>Separately, I have introduced legislative change whereby, as of 1 August 2013, regulatory directions are appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>The safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole are priorities for this Government and I have, on a number of occasions, highlighted the Governments' recognition of the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and also the importance of getting lending going in the economy. However, the issue of lending needs to be constructively considered in order to ensure a viable credit union sector into the future.  </p></reply>

As the debtor is availing of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement because of their insolvent position, it is the creditor who is bearing the ultimate cost of the fees and the VAT on the fees. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no change in the VAT treatment of insolvency services which I have just described.  I would point out that any taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a decision of the Revenue Commissioners has a right of appeal to the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.  The Appeal Commissioner hears the case presented by both Revenue and the taxpayer and comes to a determination based on legislation and the facts presented.  Cases before the Appeals Commissioners are held in camera and a decision of the Appeal Commissioner, if accepted by both parties, is specific to the facts of that case only. The Appeal Commissioners do not publish their decisions.  Where one of the parties to the appeal is dissatisfied with the decision of the Appeal Commissioners there is a subsequent right of appeal to the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Court of Appeal, as appropriate.  </p></reply>

Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. </p>  <p>  All consumer and relevant SME loans sold by regulated financial institutions will be covered by this Bill. Borrowers will therefore be restored to the protections they previously had, such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises. The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears requires lenders to constructively engage with borrowers to address a genuine arrears problem in respect of a mortgage secured on a primary home. In particular, the CCMA requires a lender to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by that lender to address a mortgage difficulty. Borrowers who previously had access to the Financial Services Ombudsman will also have this right restored by this legislation.</p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the contract.</p>  <p>  The Bill was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February. The Bill is continuing its progress through the legislative process. The Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il on 17 June and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Second Stage in the Seanad tomorrow (24 June). </p></reply>

Also, persistent late or non-payment of tax can confer an unfair competitive advantage over compliant taxpayers that pay their taxes in full as they fall due.</p>  <p>  However, the Revenue Commissioners are also very conscious of the difficult financial climate that still exists for some viable businesses and the challenges that cashflow shortages can pose for timely tax compliance. When such difficulties arise, the Commissioners clear preference is to engage with the taxpayer and agree a mutually satisfactory solution rather than deploying debt collection/enforcement sanctions. </p>  <p>  The agreed solution could include a phased payment arrangement or in some limited instances a temporary deferral of the liability. However, any such arrangement will include an interest element and will require a commitment from the business to pay future taxes as they fall due.</p>  <p>  Finally, if the Deputy is aware of a particular business that is experiencing tax payment difficulties he should advise the people in question to immediately contact the Revenue Commissioners  to discuss the issue and hopefully agree a mutually acceptable arrangement, thereby avoiding the expense and stress of debt collection/ enforcement action.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit facilities from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p><p>Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016, including lending to the SME sector.  My Department collates and examines, on a monthly basis, granular data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector. In addition, AIB and Bank of Ireland meet my officials on a quarterly basis to keep them abreast of issues pertaining to the SME sector. This facilitates the SME State Bodies Group and the Credit Review Office in monitoring progress against agreed annual SME lending plans and ensuring that new lending to SMEs continues to increase as a percentage of total sanctioned lending.I will keep this area under close scrutiny to ensure that the SME sector can access an adequate flow of credit to support the recovery of the economy.</p><p>The Government's aim for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is for it to enhance the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland. The SBCI will develop specific funding products for the SME lending market. The SBCI has also been established to last into the long term and has been mandated to consider the needs of the SME sector in particular in all of its affairs. Already the SBCI's partnership with AIB has resulted in a 2% reduction in that bank's standard interest rate offering to SMEs. The SBCI will continue to work with existing and new providers to develop specific funding products for the needs of SMEs and will also support new entrants to the SME funding markets so as to increase competition and enhance choice. The SBCI is currently in discussions with other banks and a number of non-bank providers of finance to provide products such as invoice discounting, leasing and asset based finance in order to broaden the funding options available to the SME sector and to support those providers with SBCI monies. </p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department have worked on an amendment to the existing guarantee scheme to provide funding to SMEs whose banks are exiting the Irish market. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included. </p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund. This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness. </p><p>The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer, John Trethowan and his team, have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at .</p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

In the first quarter of 2015, 5,618 mortgages were drawn down which represents an increase of 64 per cent compared with the first quarter of 2014. In terms of market composition, First Time Buyers (FTBs) drew down 53.6% of mortgages in the first quarter of 2015. The FTB and mover-purchases accounted for 85.5% of mortgages drawn down. In terms of mortgage loan values, FTB are the largest segment of the market with 50.9%. FTBs and mover-purchasers together accounted for 89.8% of the market. These figures would appear to indicate that speculative ventures are not receiving more favourable access to mortgage facilities compared with individual householders. </p></reply>

From the European Commission's most recent spring forecasts, it can be estimated that nominal unit labour costs in Ireland fell by nearly 8 percent between 2008 and 2014. This compares with an increase of 12 per cent in the UK and 8 per cent in the euro area over the same time period.</p>  <p>  In addition, relatively low consumer price inflation over the last number of years has contributed to the improvement in Ireland's competitiveness because Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to those of our euro area peers. For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2009. </p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements, wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth. In this regard we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements and gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  Therefore we need to stay focused on continuing to improve Ireland's competitiveness through other channels such as wage and productivity improvements.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by credit institutions. Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only. The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution. Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.  </p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013. This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges. It is available on my Department's website at . Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers. </p><p>The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (the Payment Services Regulations) include requirements for banks and other payment institutions to provide information to the consumer about charges, interest and exchange rates on the accounts and these are reflected in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012, which contains requirements in relation to the provision of information on charges to consumers. The website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) also lists the various charges imposed by the various financial institutions in Ireland for different types of transactions: .</p><p>Irish financial institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking. Individuals' use of their bank account will be specific to each individual and I would strongly encourage people to look at this comparison site with their specific circumstances in mind in order to decide which institution offers the best product for their pattern of account usage.  </p></reply>

It is the Government's stated position as well that the EU itself is stronger and more effective with the UK as a member.</p>  <p>  The UK's continuing membership within the Union is therefore a strategic objective for the Government.  We are accordingly monitoring developments in the relationship between the UK and the EU very carefully in order to best understand the different interests at stake.  </p>  <p>  My Department is focusing, in particular, on the economic and financial issues involved.

The purpose of the review was to analyse the benefits of the various tax measures to the agriculture sector and the wider economy versus the costs and to ensure tax policy aligns with the objectives set out in Food Harvest 2020. </p>  <p>  The Review was overseen by a working group made up of the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Revenue Commissioners. The Review included an independent cost benefit analysis, an international benchmarking exercise and a public consultation process. Following a competitive tendering process, Indecon International Economic Consultants were appointed to carry out the independent cost benefit analysis and the international benchmarking exercise. The report of the Agri-Taxation working group was published with Budget 2015 and a number of the group's recommendations were enacted in the subsequent Finance Act. These measures in particular were selected as the ones most likely to help younger and qualified farmers, improve land usage and give farmers greater flexibility to allow them to smooth out their tax exposures arising from variability in farm incomes. </p>  <p>  The recommendations in the Agri-Taxation Report which have not been implemented to date, are still under active consideration.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not yet have details on the success of the measures introduced in Finance Act 2014 on foot of the agri-tax review as the tax returns for the affected years of assessment are not yet due to be filed. In relation to the increased land mobility measures, final figures are again not yet available and I understand that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, along with Teagasc, are currently collecting data in this respect.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that they are still in discussions with the D-G Agriculture and Rural Development in relation to whether or not the relief from stamp duty on long term agricultural leases would constitute a legal State Aid.

A significant conservation project was undertaken there in recent years, including relocating the vulnerable High Cross on the site into the Church and undertaking visitor presentation works.  The site is therefore in good order currently from a preservation aspect.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, although there is free access to the site, which is open to the public daily, there are difficulties in actively marketing the venue and encouraging larger numbers of visitors to the property because of safety issues relating to the nearby N52 road.  It has not been feasible to mitigate this problem without incurring significant capital costs, and, in the current financial situation, the level of capital investment required is not available.  This position has been confirmed recently following a reappraisal of the project options after further direct engagement with the National Roads Authority.</p>  <p>  Understanding that road access is highly problematic, the OPW is currently working with other public partners locally (Offaly Co. Council and Coillte) to develop an alternative walking route which will link the National Monument property with the existing Coillte amenity forest trails nearby.  The Coillte estate is served by a carpark on its property and the objective will be that visitors will therefore, once work is completed, be in a position to park locally and walk safely to the Durrow attraction.  It would be the intention of the OPW to complete this work next year.</p>  <p>  Given the importance of the Durrow site, it remains a priority for both the OPW and Offaly Co. Council to develop an economic solution to the access problem which will ensure that the visitor potential of the site is more fully realised.  In the short term, the proposed footpath will provide visitors with a safe route into the site and this objective will remain the focus in the immediate term.</p></reply>

A report on the review was published in December 2014 which sets out a series of interim recommendations to amend the current conditions of contract used to deliver public works projects.  The second of the four interim amendments includes a provision for the direct tendering of specialist works contractors.</p>  <p>  Under the current arrangements there is an option for contracting authorities to award contracts to specialists whose contract is then novated to a main contractor. However this is really only suitable where those specialists are engaged to carry out specific tasks in advance of the main contractor's appointment.</p>  <p>  The new arrangements are intended to permit much greater oversight of the prices being tendered on projects to deal with the unsustainable pricing arising from the competitive tendering environment which followed the economic crisis. The provision for direct tendering to specialists will also allow much greater control of quality by the contracting authority for those projects with a significant requirement for specialist works. </p>  <p>  The interim amendments being introduced will;</p>  <p>  -	Rebalance the risk currently transferred in recognition of the changed economic circumstances that pertain in the industry;</p>  <p>  -	Reduce the potential for costly disputes; and,</p>  <p>  -	Provide greater detail on the tendered price.</p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements, the tendered price for the specialist works package(s) will be included in the Pricing Document in advance of the Main Contract tender where the specialist works tender(s) is concluded prior to the Main Contract tender.  Alternatively, if the specialist tender is not concluded in advance of the main contract tender, the Main Contractor's Tender Sum will be adjusted in advance of finalising the Contract Sum by means of substituting the specialist works tender sum(s) in place of the pre-determined estimated sums for specialist works.  The main contractor will then be required to appoint that specialist subject to certain conditions being met by the specialist.  Whilst the procedure is similar in many respects, it does not represent a reintroduction of the nominated sub-contractor. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the interim measures, the OGP and members of the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) are currently hosting a series of information sessions for public bodies, contractors and consultants on the amended forms of public works contracts as part of the implementation process.</p>  <p>  Further details on the amendments may be found on the Construction Procurement Reform website under the news item dated 15 April 2015.</p></reply>

Such appeals are dealt with by a caseworker who has had no previous involvement in the case and who is in a more senior position than the original caseworker.  In 2014, 157 appeals were received under this procedure; this represents about 4% of all cases received.  In the case of four appeals, the Ombudsman decided to re-examine the complaint.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations is his sole prerogative and I, as Minister, have no role in decisions in this regard. </p>  <p>  The position under the Valuation Acts regarding claims for exemption on charitable grounds is that in order for a property occupied by an organisation to be exempt from rates under the terms of Schedule 4 - paragraph 16 of the Act, that organisation must be a charitable organisation that uses the land, buildings or part thereof exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit. </p>  <p>  However, where a property which is occupied by a registered charity is used for retail purposes, it is considered that that such a property is not being used exclusively for charitable purposes.

Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations in relation to a proposed valuation to the Revision Manager in the Valuation Office. Following consideration of the representations and determination of the valuation, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, an independent body set up for such purposes and finally there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.  </p></reply>

Like the previous Haddington Road Agreement,  the current proposals for agreement represent the outcome of an engagement between public service employers and the Unions and Associations representing public servants across the public service. This process represents the standard industrial relations processes followed across the economy seeking agreement, known as a "Collective Agreement", on terms and conditions of employees and is underpinned by the Industrial Relations Acts.  As they do not include any other actors other than representatives of the employer and employees, it does not form part of a wider social dialogue process or constitute a social partnership deal.</p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of discussions on 29 May last, the negotiators on both sides, with the expert assistance of the LRC who oversaw the talks' process, have come forward with a set of proposals to form the basis of a single new agreement, the Lansdowne Road Agreement, which will extend the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement to September 2018. The proposals have been published in full and can be accessed at http://www.per.gov.ie/public-service-pay-policy/. It is now a matter for Union and Association members representing the public service workforce to consider and ballot on those proposals. The proposals, should they be ratified by the Unions and Associations, will secure an Industrial Relations framework that will foster and support further productivity and change at the level of the workplace.  The proposals also provide for the commencement of the gradual unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation, which was put in place in response to the financial crisis.   </p>  <p>  Subject to agreement by the Unions and Associations on the proposals made, I will bring forward the necessary legislative amendments to enable the terms of the Agreement to be implemented from 1 January 2016.  </p>  <p>  It is a normal part of the complex industrial relations processes within the Irish public service that sectoral industrial relations issues are discussed between sectoral management and trade unions, with or without the assistance of the LRC and/or involvement of my Department.  These discussions take place at all times within the public service and do not as such form part of any broader pay settlement applicable to the entire public service.</p>  <p>  The proposals from the LRC do not address any issues regarding the payment, or the rate of payment, of any allowances.  However, where an allowance is calculated as a percentage of the base pay rate, then any increase in base pay rates provided for under the proposals will have a consequential impact on the value of the allowance.</p></reply>

For example, for 2015, overall expenditure under these subheads is estimated at &euro;412 million while the proceeds of the National Lottery are estimated at just over &euro;200 million.  Individual Government Departments with responsibility for expenditure that is part-funded by the National Lottery can provide details of such expenditure,  including lists of recipient organisations and amounts involved.  </p></reply>

I detailed the outcome of this Round in response to the D&aacute;il Question put down by the Deputy on 13 May last.  The 10<sup>th</sup>round is scheduled to take place in Brussels during the week beginning 13 July 2015.  </p><p>According to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive free trade deal between the EU and US could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  The independent study commissioned by my Department carried out by Copenhagen Economics estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5% and increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs. It also suggests that Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be particular beneficiaries.  </p><p>Ireland clearly has much to gain under an EU-US trade agreement.  This Government, therefore, supports the EU Commission in these negotiations.  The aim of the negotiations is to achieve an ambitious and comprehensive agreement contributing to growth and jobs in the EU, and this Government's aim is to get the best deal for Ireland that will deliver growth and jobs that will be for the benefit of the long term development of our country. </p><p>These negotiations between the EU and the US fall under the EU&rsquo;s Common Commercial Policy.  The EU Commission is negotiating on behalf of all Member States on the basis of a mandate agreed by the Council of Ministers in 2013.  Ratification by Ireland of any future agreement will, in due course, be a matter for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p></reply>

It serves a very important purpose in terms of ensuring good industrial relations within a company.  It requires an employer who proposes to create collective redundancies to initiate consultations with employees&rsquo; representatives in advance of those redundancies "with a view to reaching an agreement".  The Act defines "employees' representatives" as a trade union, staff association or excepted body with which it has been the practice of the employer to conduct collective bargaining negotiations.  In the absence of a trade union, staff association or excepted body, "employees' representatives" are defined as "a person or persons chosen (under an arrangement put in place by the employer) by such employees from amongst their number to represent them in negotiations with the employer".</p>  <p>  Section 12(1) of the Act imposes an obligation on employers to notify the Minister in writing of any proposals to create collective redundancies at the earliest opportunity, and, in any event, at least 30 days prior to the first dismissal.  Subsection (3) of section 12 provides that a copy of that notification must be supplied to the employees' representatives affected who may forward to the Minister any observations they have relating to the notification.  The importance of this provision, which serves a key role in ensuring consultation and notification in instances of proposed collective redundancies, is underlined by the fact that an employer who fails to comply with this provision is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000. </p>  <p>  The Act expressly sets out who is entitled to receive a copy of a notification sent to the Minister pursuant to Part II of the Act.  It ensures that all parties directly affected by the proposed redundancies are made aware of what is contained in the notification to the Minister, and are given an opportunity to make observations on it, by providing that a copy has to be sent to the employees' representatives affected (Section 12(3)). </p>  <p>  It is in the public interest on a range of fronts that employers engage fully in the consultation and notification process set out in Part II of the 1977 Act as amended.  Firstly, such engagement plays an important role in facilitating industrial peace, which is in the interests of the wider community.  The purpose of the consultations includes the possibility of avoiding the proposed redundancies, reducing the number of employees affected by them, or by mitigating their consequences by recourse to accompanying social measures (Section 9(2)(a)).  Furthermore, they serve to identify the basis on which it will be decided which particular employees will be made redundant (Section 9(2)(b)). Accordingly, I have no plans to amend Section 12 of the 1977 Act.</p>  <p>  The policy of my Department in relation to the release of notifications of proposed redundancies under Section 12(1) of the Act is not to release such notifications except in compliance with the law, including Freedom of Information legislation.  </p></reply>

Under Irish law, military export licences have to be sought in respect of the goods and technology, and any components thereof, listed in the Annex to the Control of Exports (Goods and Technology) Order, SI.216 of 2012 which reflects the EU Common Military List.  In my reply of 9<sup>th</sup>June to the Deputy I have previously outlined the procedures in place in my Department against which all applications for export licences to Israel are rigorously assessed.</p><p>The EU Common Military List includes military goods and technology, and components for such items that should be licensed for export from the Union. Items which are classified as &quot;military goods&quot; from an export control perspective and which are exported from Ireland involve components rather than military equipment.</p><p>The Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of all military export licence applications.  All military licence applications are subject to rigorous scrutiny, and are considered in the light of the spirit and objectives of the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.  This Code, which was subsequently adopted in 2008 as an EU Common Position, seeks to safeguard, among other concerns, regional stability and human rights.  All applications for export licenses are very carefully assessed having regard to the end use and the end user and against well-established criteria.  </p><p>My Department is also responsible for licensing those dual-use items controlled pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 428/2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items.  </p><p>While the term &quot;dual-use&quot; refers to those items that are normally used for civilian or commercial purposes but may also have a military application, the vast majority of dual-use licences issued by my Department are for commercial purposes.</p><p>My Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of all dual-use export licence applications in respect of Israel.</p><p>In view of security concerns and the relatively small number of export licence holders, it is the policy of my Department not to provide details as to whether or not a certain end-user was supplied controlled goods under an export licence.  Confirming this detail, or where such exports took place, providing the information requested by the Deputy, would potentially allow exporters to be identified.</p><p>The Information Commissioner has previously affirmed my Department&rsquo;s decision to not release confidential export licensing information that could identify export licence holders. </p><p>From the data currently to hand I have however provided below details of licences issued for the export of Military List and dual-use items to all end-users in Israel from 2011 to date.</p><p><b>Licences issued for the export of Military List items to Israel, 2011 to date</b></p><p>Eleven licences for the export of Military List items to Israel have been issued from 2011 to date. Details are provided below:</p><p>2011</p><p>Three licences for the export of Military List products to Israel were issued in 2011, to the total value of &euro;6.138 million.  Two licences were issued for Military List (ML) &quot;category 6&quot; items while one was issued for ML &quot;category 22&quot; items.  The ML &quot;category 6&quot; refers to &quot;Ground Vehicles and Components&quot;, while ML &quot;category 22&quot; refers to &quot;Technology&quot;.  &quot;Technology&quot; is that which is &quot;required for the development, production or use of items or components specified in the EU Common Military List&quot;.</p><p>2012</p><p>One licence for the export of Military List products to Israel was issued in 2012.  The value of the licence was &euro;39,525 and it was issued for ML &quot;category 6&quot; items, i.e. &quot;Ground Vehicles and Components&quot;.</p><p>2013</p><p>Five licences for the export of Military List products to Israel were issued in 2013, to the total value of &euro;119,971.  Two licences were issued for ML &quot;category 6&quot; items while three were issued for ML &quot;category 10&quot; items. The ML &quot;category 10&quot; refers to &quot;Aircraft, lighter-than-air vehicles, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles &quot;UAVs&quot;), aero-engines and aircraft equipment, related equipment, and components&quot;.</p><p>2014</p><p>Two licences for the export of Military List products to Israel were issued during the first quarter of 2014, to the total value of &euro;126,637.  Both licences were issued for ML &quot;category 6&quot; items.  No licences for the export of Military List products to Israel have been granted since the end of the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>The figures provided above represent the maximum value which can be exported under the above export licences and not the value of the goods and technology actually exported under those licences.  It is important to recall that items which were classified as &quot;military goods&quot; from an export control perspective and which were exported from Ireland involved components for inclusion in, rather than finished military equipment.</p><p><b>Licences issued for the export of dual-use items to Israel, 2011 to date</b></p><p>A small number of dual use export licences are issued each year in respect of Israel.  Twelve licences were issued in 2011, twenty in 2012, twenty in 2013, twenty one in 2014 and fourteen for the year to date.

This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  An independent study commissioned by my Department carried out by Copenhagen Economics estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5% and increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.    </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland was represented on the steering group that was chaired by my Department to oversee the Copenhagen Economics study.  It is standard practice to have a steering group in any commissioned research which involves public funds.  The role of the steering group was also to ensure that any data or information required by Copenhagen Economics was provided, and also to see that the terms reference were adhered to. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland supports an EU/US Freed Trade deal (TTIP) and the potential for the increased investment which accompanies greater trading flows as identified by the Copenhagen Economics study.  IDA Ireland also welcomes the expected 3.5% increase Irish exports from the FDI sector and the expected positive employment and productivity impacts.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise with relevant Government Departments and agencies as the negotiations proceed to ensure Ireland's position is optimised under the terms of any emerging deal.</p></reply>

The Consumer Protection Act 2007 provides that a commercial practice involving the promotion or supply of a product to a consumer is misleading if it includes the provision of false information in relation to a wide range of matters relating to the product - including its main characteristics, commercial origin, benefits or fitness for purpose, the risks it presents to consumers and its composition - and if that information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing or other decision that he or she would not otherwise make.  A trader who engages in a misleading commercial practice of this kind commits an offence.  A commercial practice may also be misleading if the trader omits or conceals information necessary for an informed consumer decision and if that omission or concealment would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing or other decision that he or she would not otherwise make.   </p>  <p>  The Sale of Goods Acts 1893 and 1980 imply into contracts for the sale of goods by description a condition that the goods shall correspond with their description.  The Acts further imply into contracts of sale a condition that the goods are of merchantable quality, that is as fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly bought and as durable as it is reasonable to expect having regard to any description applied to them, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.  Breach by a seller of a condition of a contract of sale may give rise to a right for the buyer to reject the goods, treat the contract as repudiated and obtain a refund of the price.      </p>  <p>  The Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill published for consultation by my Department on 25 May 2015 similarly provides that contracts for the supply of goods include an implied term that the goods supplied match the description of the goods given by the trader.  It also provides that these contracts include an implied term that the goods are of satisfactory quality.  The Scheme sets out a clearer and more workable set of remedies for consumers where these implied contract terms are breached.  The consultation on the Scheme of the Bill remains open until Friday 28 August 2015.   </p></reply>

Such information is confidential between the Agencies and their potential and existing clients until such time as both parties are ready to make an announcement in the event of a project being agreed.  The entire process is complex with contacts and engagement underway on an ongoing basis.  Some initiatives can lead to a definite project at an early stage while others may not and indeed circumstances may change to bring a project to fruition at some future date.  </p><p>Both Agencies have had considerable success in assisting job creation projects in the region.  In relation to the IDA, the Midlands has a strong cluster in the Medical Technologies and Life Sciences sectors, which provide a significant number of jobs and in respect of which there have been several positive developments over the last few years.  A total of 554 job gains have been achieved in IDA companies in Westmeath  since 2010.  That Agency&rsquo;s new Strategy for the next five years, titled <i>'Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rsquo;</i>'  which was launched earlier this year, sets out the IDA's commitment to achieve a significant uplift in the amount of FDI projects going into regions and outlines strategic actions aimed at achieving that, including a &euro;150m property investment plan, which will support the achievement of the organization's regional goals.  That funding includes the construction of an advanced office building for Co. Westmeath in 2017, as part of the programme. </p><p>In relation to Enterprise Ireland, that Agency operates a wide range of activities in the region for their Irish-owned client companies.  It is undertaking initiatives and programmes to support research and development, more effective production, innovation generally, exporting capacity, entrepreneurial training and development  and enhancing overall competitiveness.  Over the last four years a total of 1,150 full time job gains were achieved in Enterprise Ireland companies in Westmeath. </p><p>In the Midlands region as a whole, the unemployment rate has fallen from 19.5% in  quarter 3 of 2011 to 12.4% at the end of quarter 1 2015, and while much more remains to be done, that is a considerable achievement in such a short time. </p><p>In addition, my Department has been working on the preparation of an Action Plan for Jobs for the Midlands region as part of the drive to increase the level of job creation across the country.  Eight Regional Action Plans will be delivered this year, building on the success of the national Action Plan for Jobs process, which has contributed to the creation of over 100,000 new jobs since 2012.  Significant progress has been made in preparing the Action Plan for the Midlands region, in consultation with key stakeholders there.  My officials are currently finalising that Plan and I anticipate that it will be launched in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

One of these requirements is to keep land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC).  </p>  <p>  GAEC places requirements on farmers to protect soils from erosion and maintain soil structure.  This ensures problems that may arise from compaction or rutting of land by machinery or erosion through overgrazing are minimised.  Between 2009 and 2014 farmers were required to test land which was considered to be at risk of having low organic matter (OM) levels.  Soil organic matter plays a major role in maintaining soil quality as it positively influences a wide range of soil properties such as the provision of nutrients, water retention and release, as well as reducing the risks of soil compaction, surface crusting and soil erosion.  This testing found Irish soils to be in a very positive state with high levels of OM content compared to other countries.   </p>  <p>  The protection of soils has also been strengthened in Ireland's Rural Development Programme (RDP) through support provided in agri environmental schemes AEOS (Agri Environmental Options Scheme) and GLAS (Green Low Carbon Agri Environmental Scheme) for farmers to plant catch crops.   </p>  <p>  Commonages make up approximately 422,000 hectares of the land area in Ireland and their soils are vulnerable to overuse.  Farmers who work these lands are paid via agri environmental schemes to manage these areas in an environmentally friendly manner in order to contribute to the long term health of the soil. </p>  <p>  Where fertiliser is applied, the Nitrates regulations (SI 31 2014) require that it is in accordance with crop requirements.  Certain measures within the regulations encourage soil sampling which is the cornerstone of nutrient management planning and contributes to a healthy balanced soil.  These measures include increased allowances where soils are found to be deficient in phosphorus with the target of achieving optimum sustainable output from all soils. </p>  <p>  The new Organic Farming Scheme which was launched on 21 April, 2015 provides increased payments to Organic Farmers and aims to encourage producers to respond to the market demand for organically produced food. Organic Farmers are also given priority access to the new Green Low-Carbon Agricultural Scheme (GLAS) which was launched in March 2015.   </p>  <p>  Development grants will be available to processors under the Off-Farm Scheme of Grant Aid for the Development of the Organic Sector.  This Off-farm Scheme, which is 100% exchequer funded, will provide grant aid for new equipment and facilities for production, preparation, grading, packing, storage, distribution and sale of organic products.  I hope to open this Scheme for applications shortly.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore I hope to launch a new Organic Capital Investment Scheme in the near future.  This investment scheme will be co-funded by the EU and the exchequer. The objective of the Scheme is to facilitate the development of the organic sector so as to ensure a regular supply of high quality organic produce to the market.  It will also aim to provide an incentive to young organic farmers to upgrade their agriculture buildings and equipment by providing them with an increased level of support to meet the considerable capital costs associated with the establishment of their enterprises.</p></reply>

Where such works require the submission of either planning permission or a certificate of exemption, prospective applicants under this scheme will be able to lodge their applications immediately, and they can then arrange for the provision of the required planning documents later. This will be of particular assistance to young farmers who may be worried about placing their eligibility under the scheme at risk if they have to wait to have all documents ready before they can submit an application. I am allowing applicants a full three months to obtain and submit these documents, up until the closing date of the first tranche on 18 September 2015. I should also like to point out that there will of course be subsequent tranches of this scheme.</p></reply>

The first is where the details are provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to submission of an application for a summons in respect of the offence.  Where the driving licence number is so collected, the driver licence number is sent electronically to the Courts Service with the summons application and the licence number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.

There are currently 31 vacancies.</p>  <p>  In May, 2011 the Government approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to make Visiting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities. A link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons. As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the role of the Inspector of Prisons. Under the proposed new arrangements, it is intended that Visiting Committees will report regularly to the Inspector of Prisons.</p>  <p>  Subject to competing legislative priorities, it is expected that the General Scheme will be published this year.

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.</p>  <p>  The first batch of draft submissions and letters of notification of the outcome of the review have been submitted to me for consideration. I believe that it is in the best interests of all concerned that an independent element should now be brought into this part of the process.  At my request, retired High Court Judge Mr Justice Roderick Murphy has agreed to undertake the task of overseeing the preparation of the letters of notification.  Mr Justice Murphy will be in a position to independently vouch for the fact that the summaries of conclusions and the reasoning behind them, as set out in the letters of notification, are a fair and accurate reflection of the recommendation which has been made to me as Minister.  I believe that Mr Justice Murphy's involvement in the process will offer additional reassurance to those whose cases were considered by the Panel as to the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish.</p>  <p>  Following the review of the complaint by counsel in this particular case a recommendation will be made to my Department and the outcome will be notified to the person concerned as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Panel is independent and therefore no restriction can be placed on the nature of recommendations which they might make.  I am aware of requests that the person concerned, her legal representatives and other third parties have made to have her complaints investigated by a Commission of Investigation.  Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice. Should I receive any recommendation for referral of a case to a Commission of Investigation, this will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing Commission or the establishment of a separate Commission.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 4,500 asylum seekers in 34 centres around the State.</p><p>I am awaiting the presentation to me shortly of a report of an independent working group whose remit is to make recommendations on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. One of the Group's specific terms of reference is to indicate what actions could be taken in the short and longer term which are directed towards showing greater respect for the dignity of persons in the system and improving their quality of life by enhancing the support and services currently available.</p><p>The working group which was set up late last year is chaired by former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, and comprises senior officials from all relevant Departments, the UNHCR, representatives of academia and various NGOs who have a long-standing interest in this area and other representatives of civil society. The working group developed a work programme early on and established three sub-groups to deal with the following themes. The first deals with conditions in centres, the second deals with supports for asylum seekers and the third deals with improving the processing of protection claims.</p><p>The working group has taken evidence directly from residents in the direct provision system both in writing and orally, visited centres around the country and spoken directly to residents. It has engaged with particular groups of applicants including children, victims of torture, victims of trafficking and sexual violence, members of the LGBTI community and has taken oral and written submissions from a number of experts in this field, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.</p><p>When the report of the Working Group is presented to me, it will be submitted to Government who will then consider the recommendations made therein.<font color="#000080"> </font>The Government recognises that the issues examined by the working group are complex and required thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not undermine existing border controls and immigration policies.</p></reply>

The latest 370 new Garda vehicles have begun coming on stream since the start of this year.

In the context of these functions it has been necessary for the Garda authorities to deploy Garda&iacute; routinely at water meter installations and protests.  The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in such instances is to ensure, insofar as it is possible, that members of the public may go about their lawful business.  Indeed, the presence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also essential to ensure the safety of protesters in such circumstances.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na always endeavours as best it can to facilitate peaceful protests and demonstrations.  However, it is always unfortunate when a small number of individuals resort to means other than peaceful ones to express their views, to intimidate others or to engage in protest.  We have, unfortunately, seen examples of this in respect of some of the protest actions against water charges and the installation of water meters.</p>  <p>  Of course, it is open to anyone to complain about the behaviour of an individual member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) where they feel that such complaint is warranted.  The GSOC is an independent body which was set up to receive complaints made by members of the public concerning allegations of misconduct by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Any evidence to support these claims should also be brought to the attention of GSOC.</p></reply>

It was considered that the recruitment of a legally qualified panel was the most effective solution due to the volume of cases and the complex nature of the work involved which includes the writing of a legally robust report in each case. While a member of the legal panel processes the case, the decision in respect of each applicant is made by a civil servant.</p>  <p>  The panel was established following an open competition involving advertisements in national newspapers, short listing of candidates, the holding of interviews, and the establishing of a list of successful candidates. Comprehensive training has been provided to panel members by the Commissioner in conjunction with the UNHCR to enable them to carry out their duties.</p>  <p>  Panel members receive a set fee per case completed with the basic payment for the completion of an interview and report in respect of a principal applicant within the subsidiary protection process set at &euro;330. A fee of &euro;195 applies to the completion of an interview and report in respect of the spouse or partner of a principal applicant, and a further fee of &euro;45 applies to each dependant child of the principal applicant. Commensurate fees have also been set for panel members representing the Commissioner before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in respect of subsidiary protection appeals.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that over 1,800 applicants have had interviews scheduled since December, 2013 and ORAC has made 1,246 determinations to date.</p></reply>

Armagh by the Provisional IRA in January 1976.<br /><br />The Garda Authorities have been engaged in an ongoing legal process to facilitate this co-operation in discussion with the Northern Ireland Coroner's Office.  Particular legal issues arose in the process of the preparation of material by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for transmission the Coroner.  The Government identified a way forward to help provide a means to deal with some of the legal obstacles.<br /><br />On 3 June 2015 the Government agreed these measures and also formally agreed that as much information as possible, in accordance with the law, should be provided to the inquest.  I issued a Directive to the Garda Commissioner under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and I made Regulations under the Data Protection Act 1988, both of which I laid before the Oireachtas.  The Directive and Regulations have facilitated the Garda Authorities and, accordingly, the process of transferring material to the Northern Ireland Coroner has commenced.<br /><br />The Garda Authorities will continue to work with the Northern Ireland Coroner to ensure that the greatest amount of material possible, in accordance with the law, can be provided in support of the Inquest.</blockquote></p></reply>

On resettlement I emphasised that Ireland has already responded generously and advised EU colleagues of the details of Ireland&rsquo;s response to the ongoing crisis in the Mediterranean, including the initiative to resettle 520 refugees in 2015-16 &ndash; almost double the number allocated under the Commission&rsquo;s scheme. In relation to the Commission&rsquo;s proposal on relocation, I made it clear that, while we and a number of other Member States have issues with mandatory distribution, we  want to participate in finding solutions to this crisis and to supporting Member States under pressure. That is why we are engaging fully in the discussions on the proposed emergency relocation mechanism.  Any Irish participation in this relocation scheme would have to be approved by the Government and the Oireachtas.  Only when we have a clear idea of the precise implications of these proposals, for the individuals involved and for Ireland, can we make a final decision on the part we can play.</p></reply>

Incentivised Regimes provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment. </p>  <p>  There are three levels of privilege - basic, standard and enhanced and each prison has developed an information booklet on how the scheme operates and specifically on the criteria and privileges associated with each level of regime. The Incentivised Regimes Policy provides significant motivational factors in encouraging prisoners to engage in authorised structured activities and improve general behaviour. The hope is that these benefits are not just apparent in prisons and that the behavioural change effected will stay with the prisoner on his release. Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that an incentivised regime structure is a hugely valuable addition to prisons in the context of good order and prisoner compliance. </p>  <p>  All prisoners have the opportunity to become eligible for enhanced regime status provided they have met the required criteria  for the preceding two months. To qualify for progression to the enhanced level, prisoners must participate actively in structured activities in education, work/training and/or offender programmes with approved services for at least five defined periods a week, unless circumstances outside their control prevent this level of engagement. </p>  <p>  I can reassure the Deputy that cost is not a determining factor in the operation and management of the Incentivised Regimes process. What is fundamentally important is that prisoners see that the scheme is operated in a fair and transparent manner and that appropriate behaviour and engagement with services on their part will result in increased privileges. </p>  <p>  Prisoners wishing to earn enhanced privileges who cannot avail of structured activity because no place is currently available, are placed on a waiting list and are not eligible for enhanced privileges while on a waiting list. When this situation arises, every effort is made to transfer the prisoner to an institution where the appropriate, structured activities are available, subject to operational and security concerns. Prisoner participation in activities is voluntary. Prison management and multi-disciplinary teams within prisons make strenuous efforts to encourage prisoners to engage with services as part of the sentence management process.</p>  <p>  The consistent application of the Incentivised Regimes (IR) Policy is under continuous review by the Incentivised Regimes Implementation Group chaired by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service and comprising of a representative from each prison and place of detention. The overall Incentivised Regimes Policy has been applied more strictly in the recent past as part of a national review to ensure the integrity of the policy and a fair implementation for all prisoners. This review will also include further training for prison officers overseeing the application of the policy on a daily basis and improvements to the central Incentivised Regimes database.</p></reply>

In the region of 65,000, including  children with special needs, avail of the free pre-school provision each year.   My Department does not collate figures in relation to the number of  children with special needs availing of the programme.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of measures currently in place in my Department to ensure that the free pre-school year is more accessible to children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  </p>  <p>  On the specific issue of children with special needs that require additional supports to enable them to access the free pre-school provision, the Department of Health has informed my Department that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for these children, it does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities in some instances to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources. The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Improving access to the pre-school year for children with special needs is a priority for my Department.</p>  <p>  The intersectoral work done under the chairmanship of the Office of the Minister for Disability and Mental Health and through the Cross Sectoral Team on children&rsquo;s disability issues agreed that the best approach to meeting the needs of children with a disability of pre-school age was through mainstream pre-school services, but no agreement was reached on what the model of provision would be, or who would lead out on developing this.</p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department has recently agreed with his counterparts in the Departments of Health and Education and Skills that my Department will seek to gain agreement, in a relatively short time-frame, between the three sectors (children, education, health) on the most appropriate, workable model for supports to pre-school children with special needs. This will be followed by very close co-operation between the sectors in defining/developing the model and in making an agreed cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required to implement it. The team will use information from recent consultations with parents and providers to inform their work and will conduct further consultation as the tight time-frame allows.</p>  <p>  There will be several challenges to agreeing an appropriate and workable model &ndash; including reviewing existing resources in the system to determine how they can best meet children's needs, and accessing the additional investment needed. My Department has committed to leading this process and it is my intention that a proposal will be available in time for the Estimates process.</p></reply>

It is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS Action Plan. It involves 124 locally managed projects and provides targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.</p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has had operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, Tusla allocated &euro;24.756 million to this programme, and a similar allocation is being made for 2015. I am informed that Kilkenny School completion programme was allocated &euro;260,171 for the 2014/15 school year.  Tusla has asked Chairpersons of Local Management Committees to prepare their school retention plans for the 2015/2016 school year based on the expenditure allocated last year and to return them to the Agency by June 16th last. I am advised that the Agency is currently assessing these plans. Local Projects including Kilkenny SCP will be informed of their 2015/16 budgets before the start of the new school year. The ESRI is currently reviewing the School Completion programme which will help in future decisions on its structure, governance and operations. The report is almost finalised and it is expected to be available in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  I have advised the Agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services.The School Completion Programme is an important service within the Agency&rsquo;s educational welfare services. It is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving. </p></reply>

The CCS programme provides subvention support to parents on low incomes and parents in receipt of certain social welfare payments, whose children are enrolled in community childcare facilities. Parents in receipt of Family Income Support or who hold a medical or GP visit card can also qualify for support. The subvention is used by the services to reduce the weekly fees charged to disadvantaged or low income working families based on eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  Parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 per week for each eligible child deducted from the overall weekly charge.  To ensure that access to subvention support under the programme is not a disincentive for parents to return to employment, the CCS programme allows parents to retain the approved level of funding verified during the designated week for the remainder of the academic year even when the parent's eligibility for the CCS programme is reduced by the taking up employment.   If the parent is on the highest level of subvention, the programme also allows for a reduced level of funding support for one further school year.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the person referred to by the Deputy prior to returning to work was in receipt of subvention funding based on his eligibility for Jobseekers allowance and his holding of a medical card.  He had during this period one child enrolled in the programme for 3 days full-day care.  However, during the designated verification week this year he was not in receipt of a social welfare payment but received a lower level of subvention on the basis of continuing to hold a medical card.  It should be noted that parents who return to work and are in receipt of low income may be eligible for Family Income Supplement payments which, if held during the designated week together with holding a medical card, would entitle the parent to a  higher rate of subvention. </p>  <p>  The level of subvention payable to parents with children enrolled for the CCS programmes was notified to participating childcare services in March this year with an opportunity of one month provided to parents, who considered that they were entitled to a higher level of support, to appeal the decision. My Department has not received any appeal in relation to the person in question.  I am satisfied that, based on the available information, the correct level of subvention has been provided in this case. </p>  <p>  Eligibility details for all childcare programmes are available from City and County Childcare Committees and from the Department's website www.dcya.ie.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of &euro;34 million, or 5.6%, on funding provided to Tusla in Budget 2014. </p><p>This funding increase demonstrates that, despite the budgetary constraints, this Government remains strongly committed to delivering the critically important resources and reforms needed to support Ireland&rsquo;s children and families. This additional funding is helping to drive key priorities in the reform of services, and is assisting the Agency to deliver on its mandate from Government. </p><p>Sexual violence services are being developed by Tusla, as a national specialist service, so as to enable better outcomes for both children and adults who are survivors of sexual violence.</p><p>In this regard, Tusla has appointed a national manager to ensure a single line of accountability for all resources in this important area.  </p><p>In addition, Tusla is currently in the process of recruiting eight additional staff to ensure that domestic, sexual and gender based violence services are further developed. </p><p>In my discussions this year with Tusla, regarding service delivery, I asked that particular priority be given to protecting frontline services. In this context, I am pleased that funding for the 16 Rape Crisis Centres nationwide which provide services directly to rape survivors has been protected in 2015, with funding of almost &euro;4m allocated to them.</p><p>The Deputy may be referring to funding for the Rape Crisis Network Ireland (RCNI). Tusla undertook a comprehensive review of sexual violence and domestic violence services with the purpose of identifying strategic priorities and setting out a roadmap for the delivery of these services. Following this review Tusla identified that there was scope for a more co-ordinated and more equitable provision of these services across the country. In reviewing the make-up of current services, Tusla is seeking to address any identified gaps in services, to avoid duplication and to support effective delivery of frontline services nationally.</p><p>The specific funding provided for RCNI by Tusla was to develop and maintain a database of information recorded by workers in Rape Crisis Centres. Tusla had concerns that this database did not capture information from all 16 Rape Crisis Centres as only 11 centres are affiliated with the Network. </p><p>In addition, Tusla did not always have timely access to the data collected, which is essential to support the delivery of high quality services across both the domestic violence and sexual violence services sector.</p><p>It was in this context that Tusla took the decision to cease funding of the RCNI and to take on direct responsibility for the development and maintenance of a database of information recorded on behalf of the Rape Crisis Centres.</p><p>Tusla has taken the decision to put in place a comprehensive data system that best meets the current and future data needs of a developing service.  In order to plan properly for the future, Tusla needs access to complete and reliable information. </p><p>I would just like to reiterate that funding for the 16 Rape Crisis Centres nationwide which provide services directly to rape survivors has been protected in 2015.</p></reply>

Under the ECCE programme, all pre-school leaders were required to hold a Level 5 qualification.  In addition, pre-school services could qualify for a higher capitation rate where all the pre-school leaders, in the ECCE room, held a Level 7 qualification, and all the pre-school assistants held a Level 5 qualification. This represented a major step forward in improving the quality of early years services.</p>  <p>  When the Early Years Quality Agenda was introduced in 2013, in order to improve quality in pre-school services, one of the items to be progressed was the introduction of a requirement that all staff working with children in early years services should hold a qualification in early childhood care and education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications or equivalent, and that pre-school leaders in ECCE services would be required to hold a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent.  These requirements were to be introduced with effect from September 2015 following the publication of new Childcare Regulations. </p>  <p>  In order to support existing staff to achieve the minimum qualifications, the Government introduced the Learner Fund.  &euro;3m was provided under this Fund and almost 3,000 staff have completed (or are currently completing training) to allow them to meet the minimum requirements. </p>  <p>  Despite this investment, my Department has received feedback from various City and County Childcare Committees, Voluntary Childcare Organisations, early years services and staff that the commencement of the qualification requirement in September 2015 would pose a number of challenges, particularly for staff who are currently in the process of upskilling but will not have fully completed their training by September 2015.</p>  <p>  In response to the concerns expressed surrounding the imposition of the minimum qualification requirement from September 2015, I decided to postpone the commencement of this requirement for existing services for a period of 12 months, that is, until September 2016.  However, my Department will require evidence that:</p>  <p>  -  the pre-school leader is enrolled and engaged in training to meet the Level 6 qualification.</p>  <p>  -  the pre-school assistants are enrolled and engaged in training to meet the Level 5 qualification, or hold a signed grandfathering declaration form.</p>  <p>  The ECCE contract for any new services applying to participate in programme for the first time from September 2015 will stipulate that all childcare staff must meet the minimum qualification requirements, and all pre-school leaders must hold a Level 6 qualification. </p>  <p>  I remain wholly committed to ensuring that everyone working with pre-school children holds a minimum qualification.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2015 &euro;948.8m was provided for the NHSS which included an additional &euro;10m to fund an extra 300 places which formed part of the Delayed Discharges Initiative.  However, throughout this year hospitals have experienced increased overcrowding in Emergency Departments and increased numbers of patients whose discharge from hospital has been delayed.  At the beginning of April 2015 it was announced that an additional &euro;74m has been allocated to address the issue that has arisen.  As a result delayed discharges have reduced from a high of 835 at the end of November 2014 to 649 as of the 16th of June 2015.</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;74m, &euro;44m was provided to the NHSS to fund 1,600 more places under the Scheme.  This brings the total budget for the NHSS for 2015 to &euro;993m.  The additional &euro;54m in funding in 2015 for the NHSS has reduced the number of people on the national placement list awaiting funding from 1,898 in November 2014 to 556 people as of the 12th of June 2015 (latest figures available).  The length of time spent on the national placement list has also reduced significantly from 14 weeks in November to 4 weeks currently.</p></reply>

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -  also by phone. The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. </p><p>The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. </p><p>Similar to other healthcare schemes operated by EU Member States under Community legislation, access to healthcare abroad  under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways, hence the HSE has in particular concentrated on informing the doctors who make the referrals.  For example, prior to the transposition of the Directive the HSE met with the ICGP and various consultants at hospital level to inform them of the provisions of the new Directive.  The HSE has also participated in an EU Patients Forum conference which was held in Dublin in April to inform patient groups of the Directive.  </p><p>Additionally, the HSE is at this time actively engaged with consultants representing two specific cohorts of patients to facilitate access to certain diagnostics and treatment for which there are long waiting lists in Ireland.  The HSE welcomes requests from Hospital Medical Boards to present and inform the doctors of the provision to refer patients to other EU/EEA countries for healthcare under the terms of the Directive.</p></reply>

The objective of this scheme is to support early learning in a formal setting in advance of starting school.  I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.  </p><p>The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>The <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>children and young people's policy framework that has been developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs contains a commitment to develop a plan for the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school and early years settings.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and over the summer months will coordinate an intensive process of deliberation and appropriate consultation in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills to develop a cross-Departmentally supported proposal for an appropriate model for supports to pre-school children with special needs. </p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the operational information he has requested insofar as this is available. If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

In a developed primary care system, up to 95% of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  Pharmacy services are well placed within the community to provide essential health advice and to support effective care at the lowest level of complexity.  </p>  <p>  As we continue to experience increased pressure on resources within the health system, it is necessary to consider new and innovative ways to provide the services required.  Expanding the role of the community pharmacist to include provision of services such as a Minor Ailments Scheme is worth exploring as we seek to further expand and develop the primary care sector.  A Minor Ailments Scheme can offer patients real benefits in terms of improving patient access and choice in the delivery of primary care services.  It is however important that such proposals generate real savings on existing public expenditure, as the health service continues to operate within tight budget constraints.  </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged the services of the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the evidence base for such a service, including the application of such schemes in other countries. It is expected that the evidence review will be completed by the autumn.  This piece of research will further inform the Department's consideration of this policy proposal, including any contractual or funding implications that may arise.</p></reply>

In July 2014, the Authority published a group of 12 substances which it considered suitable for reclassification.  These related to over 30 medicines used for the treatment of a variety of conditions including migraine, gastro-intestinal disorders, dermatological conditions and others.  Medicines containing these substances can, in certain circumstances be reclassified to be made available over the counter in pharmacies and supplied without prescription.</p>  <p>  In addition to this initial publication of 12 substances, the HPRA in December 2014 identified a further group of substances suitable for reclassification.  These included reclassification from both "prescription only medicine" (POM) to "over the counter in pharmacy" (OTC) status, and OTC to "general retail sale" (GSL) status.</p>  <p>  There were 6 POM to OTC substances. These substances cover medicines used in treatment areas such as irritable bowel syndrome, psoriasis, migraine and topical treatments for inflammatory conditions in muscles, and joints.</p>  <p>  There were 7 OTC to GSL substances.  These substances cover a range of medicines primarily used topically for the treatment of: minor burns and scalds; insect bites and stings; inflammation and pain in muscles and joints; mild acne; hair loss in baldness.  They also include medicines used in the treatment of eye irritation associated with hay fever and oral rehydration salts.</p>  <p>  The HPRA has directly communicated with the marketing authorisation holders for the above products (32 products in total) with a view to determining interest in the submission of reclassification applications and possible timelines for this.  The HPRA has to date received 35 expressions of interest in relation to reclassification of all of the medicines involved and is working closely with industry on this matter.</p></reply>

The policy places significant emphasis on caring for children in their own homes rather than recommending the development of a children's hospice.  With regard to perinatal services, the evidence available to us suggests that the best location of care is within the maternity or paediatric setting. </p><p>The HSE is working to ensure that quality palliative care is available to all those who need it.  In that regard, the HSE&rsquo;s Acute Hospitals Division, in partnership with the Clinical Palliative Care Programme, the Primary Care Division and the Irish Hospice Foundation, has recently commenced a programme of work to support general, maternity and paediatric hospitals to develop comprehensive plans for palliative, end-of-life and bereavement care.  Each maternity unit will identify how it can best support the palliative care needs of parents and their babies.  It is considered that this approach is preferable to establishing a very limited number of separate services. </p><p>A programme of care for children with life-limiting conditions has been established including the appointment of a Paediatric Consultant with a Special Interest in Palliative Care, based in Crumlin.  As well as supporting other paediatricians, the Consultant also provides clinical support and advice to maternity hospitals and neonatologists.  Eight Children&rsquo;s Outreach Nurses have also been appointed, and a further two nurses will be appointed this year.</p></reply>

The purpose of the National Clinical Programmes is to describe models of care and formulate guidelines, where necessary, which aim to improve quality access and value of clinical care.  The NCPA also supports ongoing education for health professionals, patients and family/carers.</p><p>The Adult Emergency Asthma Guideline was published in January 2012 and is available on the HSE website at: .</p><p>A draft revised guideline is currently undergoing evaluation by the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee and is awaiting approval.</p><p>The Paediatric Emergency Asthma Guideline has been developed and is also available at: .</p><p>The NCPA also worked with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) in the development of &quot;Asthma Control in General Practice&quot; which is a guideline for managing a patient with Asthma in primary care.  This document is available on the ICGP website at:.</p><p>This is due to be updated later in 2015.</p><p>A self-learning asthma E-Learning 6 modular theoretical programme based on the national evidenced based guidelines and developed by NCPA in conjunction with the Asthma Society of Ireland (ASI) is freely available on and for any healthcare professional who wishes to update their knowledge.  This will enable healthcare professionals to underpin their skill sets with theory.  There is also a similar programme available for GPs on the ICGP website.  In addition, a practical workshop is also being delivered by the respiratory Clinical Nurse Specialists for staff in primary and secondary care.  This education programme will continue throughout 2015.  </p><p>Up-to-date information is available for patients, their families and carers.  These easily accessible patient asthma education supports have been implemented in conjunction with the NCPA's key stakeholder, the Asthma Society of Ireland, to assist guided self-management for this chronic condition.  These are also jointly available on the HSE and ASI websites.</p><p>The NCPA has developed a National Model of Care for Asthma which details how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances and to collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is has been approved by the HSE leadership team and will be launched later this year.  The National Clinical  Programme for Asthma is committed to working with the HSE&rsquo;s operational divisions in implementing this Model of Care.  The under 6 contract for GPs that is currently being implemented for asthma in primary care is based on asthma management detailed in the Model of Care.</p><p>The Asthma Integrated Care Demonstrator Project in Primary Care has been a key focus of the NCPA throughout 2015.  The Demonstrator Project aims to deliver Asthma management in the primary care setting.  Care will be delivered by a community based Clinical Nurse Specialist (Respiratory - Integrated Care).  The project is funded through the HSE's Primary Care Division and is supported by the National Clinical Programme for Asthma, in conjunction with the HSE's Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing Division.  This project aims to provide patient assessment with spirometry and a self-management programme and will be established and supported at Primary Care level.  The self-management programme will include disease specific education, including appropriate use of medication, avoidance of risk factor exposure and detection of deterioration. </p><p>As outlined above, the components of the programme are being implemented on an ongoing basis.  The various guidelines are being revised from time to time in line with international best practice.  When the Model of Care is launched later this year, it will be up to the relevant operational divisions within the HSE to implement the programme.</p></reply>

Since 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for the provision of public water services. </p><p>The Government recently approved a National Strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water which was prepared by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG) and my Department, in consultation with Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA.  Part of the Strategy will see the establishment of a new grant scheme to assist low income households to replace lead pipes in their home.  It is envisaged that the grant scheme will be administered by local authorities and that the available resources will be prioritised to areas of highest risk.  The terms and conditions of the scheme will be publicised as soon as they are finalised by the DECLG, who will have responsibility for the scheme.  </p><p>One of the main health risks associated with lead in water is that it can affect the development of a child&rsquo;s brain leading to problems with learning and behaviour.  Lead may harm the kidneys and may contribute to high blood pressure.  It has also been linked to cancer. </p><p>The HSE has advised that no level of lead in drinking water is now considered to be completely safe.  It is therefore best to keep everybody&rsquo;s exposure to lead, from all sources (drinking, eating, inhaling), as low as possible.  Everybody should therefore try to drink water with as little lead in it as possible.  Further advice can be obtained on the following websites.</p><p><i>HSE consumer advice</i></p><p>.</p><p><i>Joint position paper of the EPA and HSE</i></p><p>.  </p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p>  <p>  Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  The importance of immunisation is acknowledged by all the major international health organisations, particularly the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>  <p>  Gardasil vaccine has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006.  It was first introduced into the national immunisation programme in Ireland in 2010. </p>  <p>  International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil vaccine is a medicinal product authorised by the European Commission on 20 September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  With this authorisation, the vaccine can be marketed in all EU Member States.  Since first authorisation the HPRA has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil.  This monitoring includes a review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union.  </p>  <p>  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  </p>  <p>  The HPRA continues to ensure that the quality, safety and efficacy of all vaccinations licensed in Ireland, including HPV, meet the required standards.

The principal function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. </p><p>Prior approval will be required for all hospital care involving overnight accommodation, healthcare that involves treatments presenting a particular risk for the patient or the population, or healthcare which would be provided which could raise serious concerns with regard to the quality or safety of the care.  The patient must submit a fully completed application form accompanied by the appropriate referring letter.  The application for prior authorisation must be assessed and a determination given prior to the patient availing of the treatment abroad.  A decision can be expected between 15 and 20 working days following the receipt of a completed application and any other information/clarification requested.</p><p>The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all inquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the co-ordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them. </p><p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The Government decided that the preparatory work required for a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  Once policy proposals have been finalised and approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer.  The Health (Transport Supports) Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme for 2015.  On foot of a Government decision, monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme closed, on the basis that this would prevent hardship and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p></reply>

Since 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for the provision of public water services. </p><p>The Government recently approved a National Strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water which was prepared by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG) and my Department, in consultation with Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA.  Part of the Strategy will see the establishment of a new grant scheme to assist low income households to replace lead pipes in their home.  It is envisaged that the grant scheme will be administered by local authorities and that the available resources will be prioritised to areas of highest risk.  The terms and conditions of the scheme will be publicised as soon as they are finalised by the DECLG, who will have responsibility for the scheme.  </p><p>One of the main health risks associated with lead in water is that it can affect the development of a child&rsquo;s brain leading to problems with learning and behaviour.  Lead may harm the kidneys and may contribute to high blood pressure.  It has also been linked to cancer. </p><p>The HSE have advised that no level of lead in drinking water is now considered to be completely safe.  It is therefore best to keep everybody&rsquo;s exposure to lead, from all sources (drinking, eating, inhaling), as low as possible. Everybody should therefore try to drink water with as little lead in it as possible. Further advice can be obtained on the following websites.</p><p><i>HSE consumer advice</i></p><p><i>Joint position paper of the EPA and HSE</i></p><p>.  </p></reply>

Four consultant transplant surgeons remain and the renal transplant programme is continuing.  Given the limited number of surgeons who specialise in transplantation, the filling of any vacancies poses a challenge.  Every effort is currently being made to fill the two vacancies.</p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital is collaborating with St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in relation to a combined approach to kidney/pancreas transplants, as well as the development of an intra-abdominal organ retrieval service.  It is proposed that pancreatic transplants, of which 6 were performed in 2014, will move to St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital this year.  The two hospitals, together with the HSE and my Department, are working in partnership to make arrangements to facilitate the commencement of this work as soon as possible.  Most pancreas transplants are combined with a kidney transplant.  The arrangements being put in place for such cases will involve transplant surgeons from both St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital working together on the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus.</p>  <p>  In May Beaumont Hospital wrote to all patients who have received a pancreas transplant, and to those on the transplant waiting list.  They also wrote to all referring consultants.  Joint assessment clinic of patients on the waiting list for pancreas transplant, involving consultants and nurses from both Beaumont and St. Vincent's, will be held at the end of July.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This issue was discussed during the 2 June Implementation and Review meeting of the Stormont House Agreement, at which I represented the Government, together with Minister of State Se&aacute;n Sherlock.  The next implementation and review meeting on 25 June will be a further opportunity to take stock. The Taoiseach discussed these matters during his meeting with Prime Minister Cameron in London on 18 June.  Both emphasised the importance of the Northern Ireland parties finding a way forward.  The Taoiseach also discussed these issues with the deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness en marge of the plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council of 5 June.    The Government continues to encourage and support the Northern Ireland Executive parties to reach an agreement on a way forward and for the continued implementation of the totality of the Stormont House Agreement. </p>  <p>  The difficult budgetary outlook in the North makes it more important than ever that stable and effective power-sharing government in Belfast presses on with repairing the divisions of the past and building a prosperous and sustainable economy.  I therefore urge the NI Leaders to exercise the powers invested in them by the people of Northern Ireland to find a solution within the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>  <p>  I hope that, with political will, a way through the current challenges can be found.  A solution will require resolve and leadership from all participants.  In the period ahead, the Government will remain closely engaged with the British Government, and with the Northern Ireland political parties, to encourage a resolution that enables the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and underwrites the stability of the devolved institutions.</p></reply>

Successive Irish Governments have raised the issue of collusion with the British Government, as I outlined during a D&aacute;il topical debate on this matter on 17 June.  We continue to do so, including in relation to a number of individual cases of long-standing concern such as the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings and the case of the late Pat Finucane, both of which the Taoiseach raised  at his meeting with Prime Minister Cameron on 18 June.  Such cases must be adequately addressed if we are to achieve a genuinely reconciled and shared society.  More than 3,500 people died during the Troubles.  The suffering of their relatives and friends endures to this day.  There is no hierarchy of loss or of grief for all these families.  Accordingly, we continue to work on the development of a comprehensive framework for dealing with the legacy of the past as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement.  The full implementation of the provisions of the Agreement in relation to the establishment of the institutions on the past remains a priority of the Government.    These institutions will include a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths, as well as an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval (ICIR) to enable victims and survivors seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths.  Good progress is being made on the establishment of these institutions which I believe will assist all victims, including the victims of collusion, in their quest for justice and the truth.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the family to provide them with every consular support and assistance.  In addition, diplomats from our Embassy in Buenos Aires accompanied and assisted the citizen&rsquo;s family during their visit to Bolivia in September 2014.  As part of this assistance, the officials arranged and facilitated high level meetings for the citizen&rsquo;s family with Bolivian officials.   The Irish Government has also raised the matter with appropriate interlocutors in both the EU and with the UN.

We support key partners, including the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), to provide essential medicines, emergency obstetric care, and post-rape supports in humanitarian crises.  This support is based on Ireland&rsquo;s firm commitment to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) agreed in Cairo in 1994.     The Programme of Action highlights the need for protection from sexual and gender based violence in emergency humanitarian situations and the provision of appropriate health care, including sexual and reproductive health care and information, counselling and psychosocial supports.</p>  <p>  The Programme of Action also affirms that abortion should not be promoted as a method of family planning and that the legal provisions on abortion are sovereign decisions for each state through its national legislative processes.  Similarly, UNFPA has a clear and longstanding policy that it does not promote abortion or provide assistance for abortion services or abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Policy for International Development reaffirms our commitment to promoting universal access to reproductive healthcare in accordance with the Programme of Action of the ICPD.  Strengthening health care systems and access to family planning are important elements of our global work to tackle maternal mortality.  In humanitarian emergencies, where health systems are often weakest, we are supporting partners such as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), who are playing a critical role in health emergencies.  Ireland is also playing a leading role in combatting sexual and gender based violence.  Our continued commitment to preventing and responding to sexual and gender based violence in situations of conflict was reaffirmed with the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s Second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade earlier this year.</p></reply>

In particular, I would recall that the sympathy of the Irish people for the dreadful suffering of Armenians was conveyed by President Higgins to President Sargsyan of Armenia on the occasion of the centenary commemoration event in Yerevan, attended by our Ambassador, John Biggar.  As my earlier replies make clear, the Irish Government has never adopted a view on this issue because Ireland is not in a position to adjudicate on this contentious matter, involving the consideration of complex legal issues and an assessment of the actions and intentions of many parties in 1915 and following years.    </p>  <p>  This centenary year has been marked by parliamentary initiatives in various countries around the world, including those referred to by Deputy Pringle.  However, it remains the case that these events have not been recognised as genocide by the UN, nor by the vast majority of its member States, whether in Europe or elsewhere.     I thank Deputy Byrne for drawing my attention to correspondence he received on this issue in which there is a call for a &ldquo;bill, resolution or motion recognising the Armenian genocide&rdquo; to be introduced into this House. I welcome the recent discussion at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, in which the Deputy participated, and I note the outcome.  </p>  <p>  I believe the members of this House share my hope that Armenia and Turkey would avail of any opportunity to advance reconciliation between their two peoples for the benefit of both countries and of the wider region.  There have been important developments in the region, not least the recent elections in Turkey, and I believe the message of reconciliation - including normalisation of their bilateral relations - could find a positive response.</p></reply>

The EU is providing &euro;400,000 in humanitarian assistance for families affected by the floods.  This funding is supporting the Georgian Red Cross and Non-Governmental Organisations to deliver relief, including food, household items, and water, sanitation and hygiene support.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of 200 observers for such missions.  The aim is to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions, organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.  The Department carried out a comprehensive review of the election observation roster in 2013.  A public call for applications to the roster was issued through the Irish Aid website.  All applicants were required to submit a detailed application form, setting out relevant qualifications, knowledge and experience in a number of areas.  These areas included: experience of election processes and election observation; knowledge of human rights and/or governance issues; experience of living in challenging environments and language and computer skills.  An independent appraisal of all 263 eligible applications was undertaken by two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The child in question was born in the State in 2012.

This residence is not, therefore, reckonable for the purposes of section 6A of the 1956 Act.Accordingly, the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship has not been demonstrated and therefore no entitlement to an Irish passport exists under the Act.</p><p>A passport was issued in 2012.  This was an error on the part of the Passport Service which was only detected when the child&rsquo;s parents applied to renew the issued passport.The Passport Service has both met and written to the parents to give notice of its decision to refuse their child a passport under the Act and to explain the reasons, for this course of action.In accordance with fair procedure, they have been given the opportunity, to make representations in the matter or present additional evidence that may warrant the issue of a passport under the Act.</p><p>The Passport Service has received representations supporting the application, however we have not received any additional evidence of reckonable stay which would allow a Passport to be issued. As a result the application has been refused based on insufficient reckonable residence in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>person&rsquo;s birth.</p><p>A letter has been issued to the parents informing them of the decision and advising them of the procedure for lodging an appeal should they wish to do so.</p></reply>

This has been widely accepted by the international community. Ireland has, in the past, joined with our EU partners to condemn any attempts to minimise or deny the genocide which took place at Srebrenica. As we approach the 20 anniversary of this terrible atrocity, we remember the 8,000 victims there, and they will be commemorated at solemn ceremonies on 11 July. The principal commemoration will take place in Srebrenica, and Ireland will be represented along with other members of the international community who will gather  together in a spirit of remembrance and reconciliation.  The European Union was founded on the principles of peace and justice, and Ireland remains committed to supporting a peaceful, secure and prosperous future for the people of Bosnian and Herzegovina and the wider region.

The State Claims Agency is engaging with plaintiffs' solicitors to clarify the position in cases and to make settlement offers where appropriate. In pursuing settlements, the State Claims Agency will be considering cases of school child sexual abuse where there was a prior complaint about the relevant teacher's sexual abuse to school authorities. The rationale for this approach is that these were the circumstances on which the European Court of Human Rights judgment was based.</p><p>The position in relation to those cases that were not progressed for a number of reasons, including those which might have been discontinued after receiving letters from the State Claims Agency is that I asked the Agency to undertake a review to clarify the exact position as to whether the cases had been formally discontinued or not. The Agency has completed its review and my Department sought some clarification from the Agency. I expect to be in a position to report to Government on this matter shortly at which time the Government will consider whether any measures will be taken in relation to these cases. </p><p>There are a significant number of additional cases in which the State has either been joined as a party or notified of the intention to seek to join the State.

However, it was not possible to secure the funding which would be required to also increase the rates of capitation paid to our schools.</p>  <p>  The school funding measures introduced in Budget 2011 provided for a 5% reduction in funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools. This was applied to schools by a 5% reduction across the range of per capita grants.</p>  <p>  The multi annual school funding measures introduced in Budget 2012, provided for a 6% overall reduction in the funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools. The reduction was introduced on a phased basis and applied by a 2% reduction in 2012 and 2013 and a further reduction of 1% in 2014 and 2015.</p>  <p>  In total these measures have resulted in capitation and related funding to the primary and second level school sector being reduced by 11%.</p>  <p>  Increasing overall funding at present for the primary sector would cost approx. &euro;2.1m per percentage point.</p>  <p>  I do recognise the need to improve capitation funding for primary schools having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  For clarity, NEPS psychologists are not assigned to schools on the basis of a number of assessments to be delivered in each nor, as described above, does assessment constitute the sole support afforded to pupils with special needs. Psychologists are in fact allocated schools based on a weighting process which takes into account school size, DEIS status, gender mix, geographical spread and the presence of special units or classes. For the Deputy's information under this process a full-time equivalent psychologist will cater to a group of schools roughly equivalent to a 5,000:1 pupil to psychologist ratio.</p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to the maintenance of the NEPs service to schools and I can inform the Deputy that current staffing resources stand at 183 (172 w.t.e.), including 5 temporary posts, the highest level since the establishment of the Service in 1999.  Furthermore the process of engaging three additional psychologists is nearing completion. </p></reply>

Teaching principals are provided with release time in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties. Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school so that the principal can come out of the classroom. Under the current arrangements the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in each school year ranges between 14 and 22 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  The NCSE generally announces the sanction of resource hours to schools in May and October each year.  My Department introduced reforms to the teacher allocation process for resource hours in recent years which included the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools to cater for NCSE approved resource hours for individual pupils in schools.  83% of all NCSE approved resource teaching hours in the 2014/15 school year were allocated to schools that had permanent resource base posts. Schools with a resource base post are required to co-operate with their neighbouring schools to ensure that any surplus capacity in the (25 hour) resource post(s) is made available to neighbouring schools to meet their NCSE approved resource hour requirements.  Where a school has less than 25 hours that cannot be met from other schools, sanction will be given for part time hours.</p>  <p>  Given that there are separate structures and arrangements in place in relation to NCSE hours and given that such allocations are subject to change each year and for some schools within each year it is not possible to combine these hours with principal release days in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.</p>  <p>  Rather than simply looking at re-introducing posts of responsibility it is important to carefully consider the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed. The Department is engaging with the management bodies at post-primary level on this issue and will, in due course, also engage with the management bodies at primary level.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the workload issue and the pressures on Principal teachers. My Department has done work at helping to ease the administrative burden on school principals. The development and introduction of the primary online database is a significant step forward in this regard. A further step forward was the publication recently of Department Circular 0033/2015 which updates and simplifies the manner in which primary schools can maintain pupil enrolment and attendance records following the introduction of the primary online database.</p></reply>

The suggestion from the Deputy is that this would be organised centrally in a manner similar to the current CAO process for students applying for entry to higher level education.  While such a system may contain attractions for applicant teachers it would appear that it would require individual schools to cede control of their recruitment process to an external body.  The redeployment process already limits the selection process for schools and it is highly unlikely that schools would agree to ceding control of their recruitment process for any remaining vacancies to an external body.</p><p>There would also be staffing an IT resource issues for this external body.  </p><p>My Department does not therefore propose to carry out the study suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is schools that employ teachers and not my Department. However my Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years.</p><p>Under these Circulars School Principals must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have had to engage a registered teacher who is retired. Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.</p><p>A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale (i.e. the lowest point or starting salary for teachers). Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable. This measure represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching. </p><p>The most recent information available on retired teachers paid by my Department and employed by managerial authorities of schools relates to the 2013/14 school year.  37,012 were employed as Teachers in Primary schools of which 302 were retired Primary school teachers. This compares to 847 retired teachers employed in Primary schools for the 2011/12 school year.  In Voluntary Secondary and Community and Comprehensive schools 20,352 were employed as Teachers of which 235 were retired Post Primary Teachers.

However it is self evident that the maintenance and running costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools. In general, second level schools are larger than primary schools and have a lower pupil teacher ratio resulting in more classrooms and specialist rooms such as laboratories, workshops and kitchens. This leads to higher unit costs in second level schools for heat, light, power, maintenance and cleaning.</p><p>I do recognize however the need to improve capitation funding for primary schools having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years. In the last Budget, I was able to secure the first increase in education spending in recent years. I am determined to continue pressing the case for increased investment in education in the forthcoming budget.</p><p>The Minor Works Grant issued to all primary schools last December for the 2014/2015 school year.

The school is projecting an enrolment of 8 pupils for this coming September.</p><p>The staffing arrangements for the 2015/16 school year provides improvement to the staffing levels of small schools.  Improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one-teacher schools have been introduced for the 2015/16 school year.  Where previously this school would have required an enrolment of 20 pupils in order to appoint a second teacher, this has now been reduced to 15 pupils.</p><p>An appeals process is available to small schools in the event that they can show that their projected enrolments are sufficient to allow them to retain their classroom teacher in the longer term.  Circular 0005/2015 provides the criteria under which schools can make an appeal. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have a student assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>In common with many other educational psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p><p>NEPS psychologists also provide a range of advisory and training services to teachers supporting the educational, social and emotional development of pupils at a whole-school, class and individual level.  Additionally, NEPS psychologists process applications for all post-primary schools nationally on behalf of the State Examinations Commission (SEC) for students with Specific Learning Disabilities for Reasonable Accommodations in the Leaving Certificate examination and provide support, upon request, to schools experiencing critical incidents.</p><p>NEPS Psychologists are allocated schools based on a weighting process which takes into account school size, type, DEIS status, gender mix, geographical spread and the presence of special units and classes. </p><p>NEPS Psychologists hold planning meetings with their assigned schools at the commencement of each academic year to discuss and agree the schools' priority needs and their particular programme of service for the year and this will vary to a degree according to the order and complexity of those needs. Service delivery to schools, as described above may be, according to the dictates of staff maternity or sick leave for example, a mixture of NEPS staff support and SCPA. </p><p>Furthermore NEPS is regionally structured with 22 offices nationally serving the needs of schools in their respective catchment areas which can and do commonly cross county boundaries.  Staff in these offices may also aggregate service across a cluster of schools (for training programmes) and so it is unfeasible to disaggregate overall service in terms of cost or time-input by school or county nor does NEPS attempt to do so.</p><p>I attach for the Deputy's information therefore, at Appendix A, an estimated cost by county of the overall NEPS service based on the weighting process, described above, and applied to the cost of the service in 2014 (the most recent complete year of operation) - some &euro;17.036m which includes all the pay and non-pay (support) charge. In relation to NEPS time in-put into Louth and Meath schools the cumulative weighting scores by county for 2013/14 are provided for the Deputy's information. </p><p>I also attach at Appendix B a breakdown of assessments provided to pupils in Louth and Meath schools for the past five academic years, whether directly administered by NEPS psychologists or by SCPA panellists.</p><p>My Department remains committed to the maintenance of the NEPs service to schools and I can inform the Deputy that current NEPS psychologist staffing numbers stand at 183 (172 w.t.e.), including 5 temporary posts, the highest level since the establishment of the Service in 1999.  Furthermore the process of engaging three additional psychologists is nearing completion.</p><p><b>Appendix A</b></p><p><b>Breakdown of NEPS Service by County 2013/14</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>-</b></th><th><b>Number of Pupils</b><br /><br /><b>In Schools receiving</b><br /><br /><b>service</b></th><th><b>Cumulative School</b><br /><br /><b>Weighting Points</b></th><th><b>Cost by County</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Carlow</b></td><td>12,253 </td><td>21,785 </td><td>&euro;249,806</td></tr><tr><td><b>Cavan</b></td><td>14,114 </td><td>26,652 </td><td>&euro;305,613</td></tr><tr><td><b>Clare</b></td><td>21,826 </td><td>41,539 </td><td>&euro;476,329</td></tr><tr><td><b>Cork</b></td><td>96,537 </td><td>159,210 </td><td>&euro;1,825,663</td></tr><tr><td><b>Donegal</b></td><td>31,364 </td><td>64,388 </td><td>&euro;738,341</td></tr><tr><td><b>Dublin</b></td><td>195,269 </td><td>351,244 </td><td>&euro;4,027,711</td></tr><tr><td><b>Galway</b></td><td>45,470 </td><td>86,242 </td><td>&euro;988,931</td></tr><tr><td><b>Kerry</b></td><td>25,952 </td><td>45,860 </td><td>&euro;525,871</td></tr><tr><td><b>Kildare</b></td><td>44,115 </td><td>71,951 </td><td>&euro;825,057</td></tr><tr><td><b>Kilkenny</b></td><td>16,828 </td><td>29,766 </td><td>&euro;341,325</td></tr><tr><td><b>Laois</b></td><td>15,462 </td><td>27,480 </td><td>&euro;315,117</td></tr><tr><td><b>Leitrim</b></td><td>5,966 </td><td>11,222 </td><td>&euro;128,687</td></tr><tr><td><b>Limerick</b></td><td>35,910 </td><td>61,252 </td><td>&euro;702,371</td></tr><tr><td><b>Longford</b></td><td>8,485 </td><td>16,351 </td><td>&euro;187,492</td></tr><tr><td><b>Louth</b></td><td>26,700 </td><td>48,228 </td><td>&euro;553,032</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mayo</b></td><td>24,448 </td><td>47,590 </td><td>&euro;545,713</td></tr><tr><td><b>Meath</b></td><td>37,188 </td><td>60,785 </td><td>&euro;697,018</td></tr><tr><td><b>Monaghan</b></td><td>12,502 </td><td>22,136 </td><td>&euro;253,829</td></tr><tr><td><b>Offaly</b></td><td>14,971 </td><td>27,554 </td><td>&euro;315,962</td></tr><tr><td><b>Roscommon</b></td><td>10,274 </td><td>22,155 </td><td>&euro;254,049</td></tr><tr><td><b>Sligo</b></td><td>11,458 </td><td>21,532 </td><td>&euro;246,909</td></tr><tr><td><b>Tipperary NR</b></td><td>14,158 </td><td>24,039 </td><td>&euro;275,653</td></tr><tr><td><b>Tipperary SR</b></td><td>16,512 </td><td>28,915 </td><td>&euro;331,569</td></tr><tr><td><b>Waterford</b></td><td>22,924 </td><td>39,699 </td><td>&euro;455,232</td></tr><tr><td><b>Westmeath</b></td><td>18,665 </td><td>32,029 </td><td>&euro;367,274</td></tr><tr><td><b>Wexford</b></td><td>29,157 </td><td>53,953 </td><td>&euro;618,675</td></tr><tr><td><b>Wicklow</b></td><td>26,259 </td><td>42,165 </td><td>&euro;483,505</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>834,767 </b></td><td><b>1,485,720 </b></td><td><b>&euro;17,036,736</b></td></tr></table></p><p>Notes: 10,000 School Weighting Points are the equivalent of 1 w.t.e.

The role of my Department is to provide guidance and support to schools in implementing child protection policy and to refer any allegations received to the appropriate authorities for investigation. My Department has issued Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools to all schools. The procedures are based on Children First and they make very clear the reporting and investigation mechanisms to be followed in cases of suspected child abuse wherever they occur. The procedures set out the oversight arrangements required at Board of Management level; the designated liaison person is required to include a report to each meeting of the board on the number of cases which have arisen since its last meeting and the Board of Management must review the school's implementation of the procedures on an annual basis. The Department has also stated clearly to TUSLA that if the agency is of the view that a school is not cooperating fully with any TUSLA investigation, then TUSLA may contact the Department and assistance will be provided to resolve the issue. Compliance with the Child Protection Procedures is assessed during whole-school evaluations by the Department's Inspectorate. School management are required to complete a standardised child protection school self-report form and inspectors also make at least three confirmatory checks of the school's compliance with specific requirements of the Child Protection Procedures. Inspectors include a statement about the school's compliance with the requirement of the procedures in every whole-school evaluation report. (A copy of the standardised school self-report form is attached for the Deputy's information). </p><p>Inspectorate monitoring does not include cases of individual concerns re children; inspectors do not examine individual case files about pupils, mindful of the guidance in Children First regarding the confidential nature of individual records. It is not the role of the Inspectorate to make judgements regarding any individual case or concern or to enquire into the details of any case: that is the role of TUSLA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p><b>CHILD PROTECTION INFORMATION</b></p><p><b>School Self-Report Form</b>This form should be completed by the School Principal and signed by the Principal and the Chairperson of the Board of Management.</p><p>Name of School:</p><p>With regard to your school, please insert a tick (<b>&uuml;</b>) in the appropriate box across from each of the following statements.<table><tr><th><b>No.</b></th><th><b>Statement</b></th><th><b>YES<br /><br />Please tick<br /><br />(&uuml;)</b></th><th><b>NO<br /><br />Please tick<br /><br />(&uuml;)</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>1.a</b></td><td>The Board of Management has formally adopted a child protection policy in accordance with the <i>Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools</i></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>1.b</b></td><td><i>Date on which the board formally adopted the policy</i></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>2.a</b></td><td>As part of the school&rsquo;s child protection policy, the Board of Management has formally adopted, without modification, <i>the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools</i>.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>2.b</b></td><td><i>Date on which the board formally adopted the policy</i></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>3.</b></td><td>The school&rsquo;s child protection policy has been brought to the attention of management, school staff (including all new and temporary staff) and parents.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>4.</b></td><td>A copy of the <i>Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools</i>is available to all staff (including all new staff).</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>5.</b></td><td>Management has ensured that all school personnel have been made aware of their responsibilities under the <i>Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools</i></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>6.a</b></td><td>A designated liaison person (DLP) has been appointed in line with requirements of <i>Children First</i>(Department of Health and Children, 2004).</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>6.b</b></td><td><i>Name of designated liaison person</i><br /><br /></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>6.c</b></td><td>The name of the DLP is displayed in a prominent position near the main entrance to the school.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>7.</b></td><td>A deputy designated liaison person has been appointed in line with requirements of <i>Children First</i>(Department of Health and Children, 2004).</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>7.b</b></td><td><i>Name of deputy designated liaison person</i><br /><br /><i></i></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>8.</b></td><td>The school&rsquo;s child protection policy is reviewed annually in accordance with the checklist appended to the <i>Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools.</i></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>9.</b></td><td>Provision has been made for the delivery of the full Stay Safe programme / SPHE curriculum and for RSE.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th><div>Signed</div></th><th><div>Date</div></th></tr><tr><td>School Principal:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chairperson, Board of Management</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It should however be noted that gas appliances which are dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fields in order to work properly come under the scope of the European Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2014 which aim to reduce the amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment that ends up in landfill. These Regulations transpose the requirements of the re-cast WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU which came into effect on 14 February 2014.  Unlike typical waste gas cookers or boilers which are more easily recycled, WEEE is a complex mixture of materials and components that because of their hazardous content and, if not properly managed, can cause major environmental and health problems. Moreover, the production of modern electronics requires the use of scarce and expensive resources. To improve the environmental management of WEEE and to contribute to a circular economy and enhance resource efficiency enhanced collection, treatment and recycling of electronics at the end of their life is essential.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants in this sector.<b></b>The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination order.  Receipt of a determination order is the official notification to parties of the final outcome of a dispute resolution case.  The order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply.  In making determination orders, the PRTB can make provision to allow for payment of awards in instalments to facilitate recovery of the award, based on the circumstances of the case.  A party who fails to comply with one or more terms of a determination order is open to having legal proceedings taken against him or her in the Courts.</p><p>Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  While there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously.  In 2013 alone it referred 394 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order. It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award. In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 is currently before the Oireachtas and will amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, inter alia, for the introduction of a new procedure to enforce a tenant&rsquo;s obligation under section 86 of the 2004 Act to pay rent pending the determination of a dispute.</p><p>This will allow the PRTB to deal effectively and quickly with tenants who do not comply with their statutory obligation to pay rent during the dispute process. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with second stage in the Seanad and will return to the Seanad for Committee Stage in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) has been established by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) as a register of builders and contractors.  Participation in the register is voluntary at present.  I understand that over 600 building and contracting entities are currently included on the register and that a further 900 are at various stages of the registration process.  Under the<i>Construction 2020</i>strategy, the Government has signalled its commitment to placing the register on a statutory footing in 2015.  This is seen as an essential consumer protection measure giving consumers who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  Legislative proposals in this regard are currently being prepared by my Department with a view to their being presented to Government for consideration in the near future.</p></reply>

The capped annual charges will be &euro;160 for single adult households and &euro;260 for all other households until the end of 2018.  All households now know what their capped bills will be until the end of 2018, which is particularly important for larger households or those with high usage due to medical needs.  In addition, a water conservation grant of &euro;100 per year will be available to qualifying households.  The Department of Social Protection is administering the grant on behalf of my Department, which will be available to households (principal private dwellings) that complete a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process on or before 30 June 2015.     </p>  <p>  The water conservation grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced and is a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will reduce households&rsquo; outlay on water services both now and in the future. </p>  <p>  The charges structure was revised with a view to making it simpler and fairer, providing more clarity and certainty to households.  The overall cost for those who register with Irish Water, net of the &euro;100 water conservation grant, is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others. Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.  </p>  <p>  When it comes to payment, a range of easy pay options are in place, including direct debits, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a paypoint or payzone sign or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made. Irish Water intends to shortly participate in the Household Budget scheme.  This facility, operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, provides customers with a facility to have their household utility bills and social housing rents deducted directly from their weekly social welfare payment.</p></reply>

Income accrues to the Environment Fund from two sources &ndash; the plastic bag levy and the landfill levy.  Both of these economic instruments are designed to encourage changes in behaviour; to tackle littering of plastic bags and to reduce over-reliance on unsustainable landfill as a waste disposal method.  The rates of both levies have been increased as necessary in recent years in order to achieve those policy objectives.  The two levies have been extremely successful in reducing plastic bag usage and in reducing tonnage to landfill, but, as a consequence of its success strictly from an environmental behaviour perspective, revenues to the Fund have been declining in recent years.  Compared to &euro;65.7m revenue to the Fund in 2012, total revenue to the Fund dropped to some &euro;46m in 2014.  The latest indications are that revenue from the landfill levy, which is the largest component of the Environment Fund, will suffer a further significant decline in 2015.  Accordingly, the capacity of the Environment Fund to continue to support environmental initiatives and organisations is under increasing pressure.      </p>  <p>  In this context of a reduced Fund, I am currently giving careful consideration to the 2015 allocations and I hope to be in a position to announce these allocations in the very near future.</p></reply>

Close to one-third of households living in the sector are in receipt of housing support in the form of rent supplement or other State support and so the sector is of key importance for the provision of social housing also.  This is recognised in the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>goal to meet the needs of 75,000 households in the sector, primarily through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.  Following on from the commitment in <i>Construction 2020</i>to develop a national policy towards professionalising the private rental sector, the Social Housing Strategy includes an action (Action 35) to continue work on the development of this policy with the aim of increasing investment in and supporting the supply of, good quality, secure and affordable rental accommodation.  The timeline for this is the fourth quarter 2015.</p><p>The governance structure established to ensure that the actions in the Social Housing Strategy are overseen and delivered includes five workstreams or working groups, each with a specific focus.  The development of the policy on the private rented sector is taking place in the context of Workstream 5 which includes officials from my Department and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform as well as representatives of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the National Economic and Social Council (NESC), the Housing Agency and the local authority sector.</p><p>In the period since the publication of Construction 2020, a number of reports on the future of the private rented sector have been published.  Notably these include two reports by DKM Economic Consultants, commissioned by the PRTB, and a series of reports from NESC including <i>Social Housing at the Crossroads: Possibilities for Investment, Provision and Cost Rental</i>and most recently, <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Private Rental Sector: Pathways to Secure Occupancy and Affordable Supply</i>.</p><p>The latter report calls for more secure occupancy for tenants, including greater rent certainty as well as measures to increase the supply of rental housing.  The recommendations put forward in these reports will be considered carefully in the context of framing a national policy on the private rented sector.  My overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

Municipal districts and borough districts, where they arise, now cover the entire territory of counties, reflecting European norms and ending the anomaly of small towns having municipal status and dual representation, while some larger centres and rural areas lacked any sub-county governance.  As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system will, over time, result in more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation with improved accountability and responsiveness to local needs.  Moreover, under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. </p>  <p>  A further important rationale for the new system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions.  The performance of different functions by members at county and municipal or borough district levels will result in greater effectiveness than the previous parallel town and county system, which involved a significant element of duplication. The division of functions between county and district has been determined on the basis of what is most relevant to each level.  Local matters are to be dealt with at municipal or borough district level, while those of wider strategic application are being decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind in relation to the new sub-county governance arrangements that we are in the very early stages of reform.  Municipal and borough districts only came into operation on 1 June 2014 and 2015 will be the first full year of their operation.  Against this background, I have initiated an evaluation process on the operation of the new structures through a broadly based advisory group which my Department has recently reconvened together with a working group for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government, both of which played an important role in the early stages of the local government reform process.  The groups will give particular consideration to how the new governance arrangements are impacting on towns and whether any adjustments are needed in light of experience to date, including civic aspects, such as the status of mayors of borough and municipal districts and the economic and community development of towns. </p>  <p>  In parallel with this review, I have recently announced the establishment of statutory committees to review local government boundaries in a number of towns, including Drogheda, where there is a significant overspill of population into another county.  The committee examining Drogheda is due to report to me by end November 2015.</p></reply>

Following the deliberations of the Task Force, at that stage, the main thrust of the emerging recommendations was the introduction of a national licensing regime applied to Adult Entertainment activity under the proposed Casino regulation then being brought forward by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (including a requirement for production of a tax compliance certificate) and the introduction of a new special restricted film classification by the Irish Film Censors Office to encompass certain DVD&rsquo;s and videos.  In the event however, a final Report was not submitted to the Minister and the Government and it may be that these recommendations are no longer relevant or are overtaken by events.    </p>  <p>  Planning law has been amended a number of times recent years, but no amendment has been made in relation to the siting of adult entertainment venues. I will reflect on whether it is appropriate to make any changes to planning law in this area; this will need to take account of the fact that planning is largely concerned with the appropriateness of a particular development in terms of its land use impacts, such as amenity, visual impact, noise, traffic, overlooking, environmental effects, etc.  It is unclear that adult shops have any such additional land use impacts as distinct from other shops, such that they should be governed by planning law; however, I will consider the matter further.</p></reply>

I can confirm that data from the pilot sites has been gathered and I submitted a report to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht   at the end of April 2015. Based on the findings of that review, the second phase of the HAP statutory pilot has recently commenced with the HAP scheme becoming operational in Donegal County Council on 25 May 2015 and in Offaly County Council on the 15 June 2015. HAP will become operational in Carlow, Clare and Tipperary County Councils and Cork City Council from 29 June 2015.   Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year. While no implementation date has yet been confirmed, my Department is working with Kildare County Council to make the necessary arrangements for their inclusion in the next phase of the pilot.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-23a.1446.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062300079#WRBB01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 613 to 615, inclusive, and 627 together. </p><p>With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services.  Under the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations. The Regulations implement the EU Drinking Water Directive in Ireland . The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 microgrammes per litre, which came into effect on 25 December 2013. </p><p>In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership should be replaced over time. The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system. Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the property boundary to the house and within the house therefore rests with the homeowner.  The position paper acknowledges that while, in its Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (2011), the World Health Organisation (WHO) considered that while there is no tolerable threshold dose for lead in drinking water, the WHO also recommended that a guideline value of 10 microgrammes per litre was acceptable.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with the Drinking Water Regulations. In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier is required to investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive (HSE), to ensure that the appropriate remedial actions are taken, including the issue of notifications to consumers affected and, if appropriate, restriction of the supply.  A case by case approach will be considered by Irish Water, in line with its statutory responsibilities and in recognition of the statutory responsibilities of the HSE and the EPA.  I have no role in the monitoring or supervision of water services and, a s the proper procedures are being followed in relation to this matter, it would be inappropriate for me to interfere with the process by meeting with residents of St. Anne&rsquo;s at this time.  A comprehensive reply to a letter received from the chairperson of the residents committee of Saint Anne&rsquo;s Estate, Raheny was issued by my Department in February 2015 in relation to these matters.</p><p>The Water Charges Policy Direction issued to the Commission for Energy Regulation in July 2014 referred to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted.  Where a customer is subject to a drinking water restriction notice, affected customers will receive a 100% discount to the water supply portion of their bill for the duration of the restriction.  I understand that lead exceedances in the Raheny area have been reported to the EPA arising from samples taken at individual private dwellings.  The EPA has indicated to my Department that, in each case, its investigations have concluded that the appropriate actions were taken and advice was given to the householders concerned.  However, no water restriction under the Drinking Water Regulations has been issued to residents of the area in question. </p><p>Earlier this month I announced a National Strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water which has been approved by the Government. The Strategy was prepared by my Department and the Department of Health in consultation with Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA. As part of the Strategy I will be establishing a new grant scheme to assist with the replacement of lead pipes in homes.  Funding for the scheme will be finalised in the context of Budget 2016. It is envisaged that the grant scheme will be administered by local authorities and that the available resources will be prioritised to areas of highest risk. It will be important to ensure that the limited financial resources available are targeted where needed most, particularly to householders on lower incomes. Income thresholds will therefore apply. </p><p>The terms and conditions of the scheme will be publicised as soon as they are finalised. Householders who do not meet the eligibility criteria for the new scheme may qualify for relief under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme introduced under Section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013. The HRI scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including plumbing works . The scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and full details are published on Revenue&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>.</p></reply>

Wood Mackenzie furnished their Final Report at end May 2014.</p><p>The principal recommendations made by Wood Mackenzie were as follows:</p><p>-For now Ireland should maintain a concession system with industry rather than the State bearing the risk associated with investing in exploration;</p><p>-Going forward a form of production profit tax should continue to apply in Ireland, but for discoveries made under future licences the form of this tax should be revised;</p><p>-The tax should be charged on a field-by-field basis with the rate varying according to the profitability of the field and charged on each field&rsquo;s net profits;</p><p>-That the revised tax should include a minimum payment at a rate of 5% which would function like a royalty and would result in the State receiving a share of revenue in every year that a field is selling production;</p><p>-That the revised tax rates should be higher than the Profit Resource Rent Tax currently in place, thereby ensuring a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in a maximum rate of 55% applying in the case of new licences, compared with a maximum rate of 40% under the current fiscal regime;</p><p>-That the corporation tax rate applying to petroleum production should remain at 25%;-That the existing licensing terms (duration of licences, work commitments etc.) remain intact as they appear &lsquo;fit for purpose&rsquo; and are comparable to those available in other countries with high exploration risk;</p><p>-That the use of production sharing contracts or mandatory state participation in licences would not be appropriate at this juncture in the development of the Irish Offshore.</p><p>-That the Government should consider the potential role a National Oil Corporation might play in the development of the Irish Offshore taking into account stakeholder views.</p><p>In June 2014 Government approval was received to revise Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms along the lines recommended by Wood Mackenzie.</p><p>A Steering Group, with representation from the Department of Finance, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, has been tasked with preparing proposals to give legislative effect to the approach recommended by Wood Mackenzie and is currently progressing same, and that the necessary revisions would be effected by way of the Finance Bill 2015.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available. </p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers plan to deliver high speed broadband services. The AMBER areas on the map show the target areas for the State intervention. </p><p>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>Under EU State Aid rules, public investment in a commercial market has to be targeted at areas where there is evidence of market failure. Therefore, the Government's proposed investment under the NBP will apply to those parts of the Midlands comprising Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath that are within the Amber areas of our map. Those premises in the Midlands that fall within the Blue areas will be provided with services through commercial investment. </p><p>Eircom recently announced an investment that may address a further 300,000 premises with fibre-to-the-premises technology. My Department will be rigorously examining the assurances from eircom in relation to these new plans, which is a requirement for all operators, and will review how this impacts the proposed intervention area.</p><p>More generally I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to 52,758 premises to date in the Midlands covering counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath with a further 26,843 expected to be served through commercial investment. The remaining 62,836 premises in those counties will be covered by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention. </p><p>Intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area. Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.</p><p>I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take 3-5 years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected. </p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in mainly rural parts of the country.</p></reply>

The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The proposed State intervention under the NBP represents a potentially very significant capital investment project for the State and the Government is firmly committed to delivering this investment, as evidenced in the National Broadband Plan itself and in the Programme for Government, the Action Plan for Jobs and the Statement of Government Priorities.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers plan to deliver high speed broadband services. The AMBER areas on the map show the target areas for the State intervention. </p><p>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>Under EU State Aid rules, public investment in a commercial market has to be targeted at areas where there is evidence of market failure. Therefore, the Government's proposed investment under the NBP will apply to those parts of the Midlands comprising Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath that are within the Amber areas of our map. Those premises in the Midlands that fall within the Blue areas will be provided with services through commercial investment. </p><p>eircom recently announced an investment that may address a further 300,000 premises with fibre-to-the-premises technology. My Department will be rigorously examining the assurances from eircom in relation to these new plans, which is a requirement for all operators, and will review how this impacts the proposed intervention area.</p><p>More generally I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to 52,758 premises to date in the Midlands covering counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath with a further 26,843 expected to be served by commercial investment. The remaining 62,836 premises in those counties will be covered either by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention. </p><p>Intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area. Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. </p><p>I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take 3-5 years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected. </p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in Ireland, including the important enterprise issues identified by IBEC. </p></reply>

My Department has no function in relation to the administration or sale of these artworks.</p>  <p>  When I met with trustees of the Alfred Beit Foundation last week, I asked them to delay the sale of the artworks, so other options could be explored.  While conscious and respectful of the independence of the Foundation, my clear preference is for these artworks to be kept in Ireland, if possible.</p>  <p>  I am pleased, therefore, that the Chair of the Foundation has decided to propose to the Foundation board to postpone the sale, in light of my request and the emergence of Irish donors who are considering the purchase of some of the artworks.  I understand that this would involve the donation of artworks to an Irish cultural institution using section 1003 tax relief.  This is welcome.  I also welcome the fact that the Foundation proposes to enter negotiations with the auction house handling the sale.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that, while funding constraints remain, the tax relief provided by the Government under section 1003 of the Finance Act continues to provide a generous mechanism to enable artworks, which would otherwise have left the State, to be kept here.  The postponement of the sale would allow the necessary breathing space to explore how this mechanism can assist in this case.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the significant challenges which face those who seek to maintain our major historic houses, such as Russborough.  I intend to engage with my Government colleagues, including the Minister of State at the OPW, and other State agencies, to consider how we can work together to safeguard the future of Russborough.</p>  <p>  As Minister with responsibility for Heritage, I am also committed to finding sustainable solutions for the wider historic houses sector.  The Steering Group on Historic Houses, which I established several months ago, is due to report to me shortly with proposals in relation to action points that would assist in protecting and promoting this sector into the future.</p>  <p>  The National Gallery, by administrative arrangement since 1985, has operated the export licensing system for paintings, under the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act 1945, since it was delegated to the Director of the Gallery by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for the Arts.

I understand that it has not been possible to negotiate a purchase agreement in the meantime and that the Office of Public Works is continuing to engage with the landowner with the objective of bringing the matter to a conclusion, one way or the other, without further delay.  Any negotiations must, of course, continue to be conducted within the confines of the Office of Public Works&rsquo; site valuation and the limited capital funding available to my Department and the Council for the proposed acquisition.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy, however, that, irrespective of the outcome, this important national monument will remain in my guardianship as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and will continue to enjoy the highest level of protection under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004.</p></reply>
