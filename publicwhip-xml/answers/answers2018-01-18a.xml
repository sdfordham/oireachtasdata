    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-18a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011800054#WRA00600"><p>As the Deputy will be aware the allocations for both current and capital expenditure in any given year are set out in the Revised Estimates Volume.  The allocations are discussed by the relevant committee before they are brought back to the D&aacute;il for vote. </p><p>I have arranged for the gross and net capital allocations for 2017 to be set out for the Deputy in the tabular format requested in her question and will forward it to her in due course.  The table includes adjustments made by way of Further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates.  The table also includes the indicative net outturn for 2017.  The overall allocations are in line with the fiscal rules in which we operate under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p><p>Sustainable public finances are, of course, essential to support growth in the economy and build resilience to respond to potential adverse economic and fiscal developments.  Budget 2018 set out prudent sustainable growth in public expenditure. On Budget day, I announced an additional allocation of capital expenditure of &euro;4.3 billion over the next four years up to the end of our existing Capital Plan. This additional capital investment set out on Budget day for schools, hospitals housing and public transport will continue to support economic growth, enhance the economy's resilience and help maintain international competitiveness in terms of both trade and attractiveness to foreign direct investment.</p><p>I am satisfied that this new planned level of public capital investment represents an appropriate balance between the need for additional investment to realise the economy's long-term growth potential, the capacity of the economy to deliver additional public infrastructure consistent with fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability, and the need to adhere to the responsible spending path agreed by Government with reference to the requirements of the EU Fiscal Rules. </p><p>In the meantime, the delivery of a large number of public capital investment projects and programmes is proceeding.  While the position in relation to any individual project is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant responsible Minister, the review of the capital plan, includes an update for each Department setting out the significant progress already being made in relation to implementation.  A copy of the review has been supplied to all Deputies.  My Department also published a major projects tracker on its website (www.per.gov.ie), providing an update on progress on all significant projects and programmes with a value in excess of &euro;20m.  The project tracker will be updated in 2018 as details become available in relation to the 2018 outturn on individual projects.<table><tr><th>Votes - Government Departments</th><th>Gross Capital</th><th>Net Capital</th><th>Net Outturn</th></tr><tr><td>V7 - DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE </td><td>2,274</td><td>2,274</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>V9 - OFFICE OF THE REVENUE COMMISSIONERS </td><td>23,000</td><td>23,000</td><td>18,946</td></tr><tr><td>V11 - PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND REFORM </td><td>8,535</td><td>8,535</td><td>7,691</td></tr><tr><td>V13 - OFFICE OF PUBLIC WORKS </td><td>126,049</td><td>124,049</td><td>122,470</td></tr><tr><td>V17 - PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS SERVICE </td><td>635</td><td>635</td><td>535</td></tr><tr><td>V18 - NATIONAL SHARED SERVICES OFFICE </td><td>14,289</td><td>14,289</td><td>7,464</td></tr><tr><td>V20 - GARDA S&Iacute;OCH&Aacute;NA </td><td>89,070</td><td>89,070</td><td>80,163</td></tr><tr><td>V21 - PRISONS </td><td>22,330</td><td>22,330</td><td>20,097</td></tr><tr><td>V22 - COURTS SERVICE </td><td>60,683</td><td>60,683</td><td>54,435</td></tr><tr><td>V23 - PROPERTY REGISTRATION AUTHORITY </td><td>560</td><td>560</td><td>545</td></tr><tr><td>V24 - JUSTICE AND EQUALITY </td><td>7,405</td><td>7,405</td><td>2,830</td></tr><tr><td>V25 - IRISH HUMAN RIGHTS &amp;amp; EQUALITY   COMMISSION </td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>565</td></tr><tr><td>V26 - EDUCATION AND SKILLS </td><td>693,350</td><td>690,500</td><td>690,741</td></tr><tr><td>V27 - INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION </td><td>500</td><td>500</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>V28 - FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE </td><td>10,500</td><td>10,500</td><td>11,679</td></tr><tr><td>V29 - COMMUNICATIONS, CLIMATE ACTION &amp;amp;   ENVIRONMENT </td><td>170,964</td><td>170,964</td><td>151,000</td></tr><tr><td>V30 - AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND THE MARINE </td><td>238,000</td><td>238,000</td><td>195,325</td></tr><tr><td>V31 - TRANSPORT, TOURISM &amp;amp; SPORT </td><td>1,142,141</td><td>889,585</td><td>872,953</td></tr><tr><td>V32 - BUSINESS, ENTERPRISE &amp;amp; INNOVATION </td><td>547,000</td><td>546,500</td><td>545,912</td></tr><tr><td>V33 - CULTURE, HERITAGE &amp;amp; THE GAELTACHT </td><td>51,300</td><td>51,300</td><td>50,085</td></tr><tr><td>V34 - HOUSING, PLANNING &amp;amp; LOCAL   GOVERNMENT </td><td>793,984</td><td>793,984</td><td>792,290</td></tr><tr><td>V36 - DEFENCE </td><td>74,000</td><td>71,500</td><td>92,100</td></tr><tr><td>V37 - EMPLOYMENT AFFAIRS &amp;amp; SOCIAL   PROTECTION </td><td>10,000</td><td>10,000</td><td>7,313</td></tr><tr><td>V38 - HEALTH </td><td>454,250</td><td>454,000</td><td>454,000</td></tr><tr><td>V39 - OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT </td><td>1,070</td><td>1,070</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>V40 - CHILDREN AND YOUTH AFFAIRS </td><td>25,620</td><td>25,620</td><td>32,060</td></tr><tr><td>V42 - RURAL &amp;amp; COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT </td><td>76,908</td><td>69,422</td><td>39,960</td></tr><tr><td>Vote Total</td><td>4,644,517</td><td>4,376,375</td><td>4,252,271 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

These resources have been allocated on the basis of a detailed assessment of public capital investment needs set out in the review of the current capital plan drawing on the comprehensive infrastructure capacity and demand analysis prepared by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service and published alongside the capital review last September.  It is also important to note that these investment resources are in addition to the additional &euro;2.2 billion for housing outlined in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  </p>  <p>  Consequently between 2014 and 2021 public capital expenditure in Ireland will have more than doubled and as set out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment in Ireland moving to among the highest in the EU.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently preparing a long-term 10-year capital plan, covering the period 2018 to 2027, which will be integrated with, and will support the achievement of, the spatial planning objectives of the forthcoming National Planning Framework detailed under the Ireland 2040 Plan, to ensure that there is a sustainable basis for future population, employment and economic growth on a balanced regional basis.  The 10-year plan will set out the Government's plans for capital investment over the longer term and it will also set out how the Government proposes to ensure an appropriate regional balance is achieved in terms of infrastructural investment, consistent with the objectives of the National Planning Framework. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that promoting the development of the North-West Region as an interlinked area of strategic importance through collaborative structures and a joined-upapproach to spatial planning is a specific national policy objective included in the draft Ireland 2040 Plan. </p>  <p>  In addition to the recent opening of a new court house in Letterkenny, projects scheduled to be implemented for Co Donegal will include the upgrading of 3 sections of the N56 and the provision of 177 grants to primary schools under the minor works grant scheme. </p>  <p>  I should point out, however, that the selection of individual projects to be progressed, such as individual infrastructure projects in County Donegal, and the specific level of capital allocations arising will continue to be a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant sectoral Minister and their Departments and agencies - subject to compliance with the requirements of the Public Spending Code in relation to planning, assessment and appraisal of project proposals in the normal way.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-18a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011800054#WRA01200"><p>In March 2017 the Department of Justice and Equality wrote to my Department seeking sanction for two retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one civilian to support the work of the Disclosures Tribunal. It was the view of the Department of Justice and Equality that these resources were required to support the timely completion of the work of the Tribunal and also to minimise any potential negative impacts on the delivery of the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme.  My Department responded in April seeking assurances that alternative approaches had been considered and that the re-hiring of former senior Garda officers would not negatively affect the workings of the Tribunal. The Department of Justice and Equality subsequently wrote back to my Department later that month providing an assurance that it was satisfied that the proposed approach was the most appropriate one given the pressure on Garda corporate resources and the demanding timelines for the Tribunal.  Accordingly, sanction was issued by my officials in early May based on this assessment.</p>  <p>  Sanction was issued by my Department on the basis that all expenditure would be strictly met from within the existing resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, approval was not provided for any additional spending beyond the revised estimate allocation for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vote in 2017.  This is the normal practice for sanction requests submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform once the financial allocation for the year has been published in the revised estimates volume.</p>  <p>  The latest information provided to my Department from the Department of Justice and Equality indicates that expenditure on the staff re-hired to support the Disclosures Tribunal amounted to &euro;78,840 as at the end of November 2017. I understand that this relates to one retired assistant commissioner and one retired Chief Superintendent. As I understand it, a civilian was not re-hired to support the work of the Tribunal.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-18a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011800054#WRA01400"><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the determination of the allocation of teachers is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, in the first instance. However, based on information provided to my Department by the Department of Education and Skills, I am informed that there is not a teacher shortage but rather a shortage of teachers in some specific subject areas. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there has been significant recruitment in the Education sector in recent years.  The Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills has informed me that an estimated additional 2,900 posts were filled in 2016/17, nearly 500 more than announced in Budget 2017 and the process of filling all of the additional posts is almost complete. </p>  <p>  With respect to overall teacher allocations and projected teacher demands, there was considerable engagement between both Departments in the context of Budget 2018 which made provision for almost 1,300 additional teaching posts in primary and secondary schools.  Budget 2018 prioritised support for children with special educational needs and provided support for new STEM and Digital learning initiatives in classrooms to provide for the needs of the sector in 2018/19.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the Department of Education and Skills is aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting teachers in specific subjects at post-primary level, including in STEM.  I also understand that no request in relation to this specific issue has been submitted to my Department.  Any initiative proposed by the Department of Education and Skills in this area that potentially gives rise for the need for increased resources will, of course, need to be considered in the normal way in the context of the Estimates process. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills is strongly committed to examining all possible means of responding to the issue of teacher shortages in specific subjects.  For example, as part of the implementation of the STEM Strategy and the Foreign Languages in Education Implementation Plans, the Minister for Education and Skills has committed to delivering increased teacher supply in key priority areas, assessing specific policy initiatives which can accelerate supply in critical areas.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recognise that reflecting the size, diversity and distribution of the post-primary education there are significant complexities involved in workforce planning for the sector.  Careful consideration is required of all the various elements.  In terms of population trends of school-age children, officials in my Department are currently working in collaboration with officials in the Department to Education and Skills to better understand the number of teachers required in future years based on current demographic trends.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that given the significant recruitment in the sector in recent years and the plans for 2018/19 there are strong career opportunities for teacher graduates in the post-primary sector.  In addition, it is important to point out that the pay of a new recruit teacher compares favourably to other new recruits in the public sector and beyond; from 1 January 2018, the first point of the salary scale for a newly recruited teacher amounts to &euro;35,958 (on a 27 point salary scale reaching a maximum of &euro;67,538).</p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  The Erne Catchment is being assessed under the Office of Public Work&rsquo;s in close co-operation with the Rivers section in the Department for Infrastructure, Northern Ireland.  This co-operation is part of our respective implementation of the EU Floods Directive and therefore the Erne Catchment in both Ireland and Northern Ireland has been fully assessed as part of the CFRAM Study.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Erne Catchment system, CFRAM&rsquo;s Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) study, carried out in 2011, identified Cavan Town and Ballyconnell in Co. Cavan and Ballybay in Co. Monaghan as Areas of Further Assessment (AFA) and are being assessed as part of the North Western-Neagh Bann CFRAM Study.  This included public consultation events held in Spring 2015 on the draft flood maps, Spring 2016 on the preliminary options and Autumn 2016 on the draft plans.</p>  <p>  In Cavan Town and Ballybay structural options are proposed in the draft Flood Risk Management Plan; and Ballyconnell has been assessed to have a very low level of flood risk.  The Plans also set out other flood risk measures to address the flood risk in the River Erne catchment.</p>  <p>  The final Plans are currently undergoing an independent review of the strategic level environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Once this independent review of all Plans is completed and observations addressed, I would hope in the coming weeks to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the 29 Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM process.</p></reply>

In this regard, the OGP has developed the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which consists of 5 strands:  </p>  <p>  - Legislation (Directives, Regulations) </p>  <p>  - Government Policy (Circulars, etc.) </p>  <p>  - Capital Works Management Framework for Public Works </p>  <p>  - General Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services </p>  <p>  - More detailed technical guidelines, template documentation and information notes as issued periodically by the OGP</p>  <p>  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procurement procedures to be followed by public bodies.  The framework supports contracting authorities, including the OGP, the four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, when awarding contracts for works, goods and services.  It enables public bodies to adopt procedures to meet their Public Procurement requirements and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules.</p>  <p>  Last July, I launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules. </p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting that while the OGP guidelines facilitate and enable compliance with public procurement rules, it is the responsibility of each Contracting Authority to ensure they adhere to these rules.</p>  <p>  The OGP supports compliance by putting in place compliant procurement solutions, publishing guidelines and template documentation and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive.  Information sessions are also provided for public bodies such as the OGP Procurement Event for Central Government held in Dublin Castle last March.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the OGP's Key Account Managers are in regular contact with Procurement Officers in Government Departments and State Bodies to assist, support and remind them of their obligations in relation to public procurement.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, and the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and Accounting Officers are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred. Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement.</p></reply>

It was the view of the Department of Justice and Equality that these resources were required to support the timely completion of the work of the Tribunal and also to minimise any potential negative impacts on the delivery of the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme.  My Department responded in April seeking assurances that alternative approaches had been considered and that the re-hiring of former senior Garda officers would not negatively affect the workings of the Tribunal.  The Department of Justice and Equality subsequently wrote back to my Department later that month providing an assurance that it was satisfied that the proposed approach was the most appropriate one given the pressure on Garda corporate resources and the demanding timelines for the Tribunal.  Accordingly, sanction was issued by my officials in early May based on this assessment.</p>  <p>  It is the normal day to day process that sanctions are conveyed by officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on behalf of the Minister.  In some cases particular proposals may be brought to my attention if it is warranted in the view of my officials from a policy or spending perspective.  In this case, direct ministerial sign off was not sought given the assessments sought from and provided by the Department of Justice and Equality regarding the need to re-hire staff to support the Tribunal.  This also took into account the urgency of the request and the relatively low level of expenditure involved.</p></reply>

The analytical papers are all available on my Department's website.  This was the first cycle of a series of selective reviews of the current expenditure base that will remain in place for a 3-year period.  The spending review will operate as a separate but parallel process to the Budget and will therefore inform the preparation of the next two Budgets.</p>  <p>  In advance of Budget 2019, the Spending Review in 2018 will examine the next phase of expenditure topics.  It is planned that the remaining phase of the Spending Review will be covered the following year.  The primary objective of the Spending Review in 2018 is to build on the work completed in 2017 and continue to reinforce the use of data, evidence and analysis to support decision-making in the Estimates process.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of significant risks - both internal and external - to the sustainability of our current growth and fiscal performance.  These require that Government secure the continuation of sound public finances to underpin sustainable economic growth.  The experience from recent years is that this is best achieved by allocating scarce resources in the most efficient and effective way. The Spending Review is a key tool that can enable the achievement of this goal.</p>  <p>  The second annual cycle of spending reviews is currently underway involving the identification of topics on which analytical papers will be prepared. </p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans.  </p>  <p>  The Programme is focusing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans.  </p>  <p>  The Draft Flood Risk Management Plans were published for public consultation between July to December 2016, with a significant volume of submission topics received for consideration.  In Summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and as required between August and September 2017, each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an independent review of the environmental assessments.  This independent review is nearing completion, after which the Final Plans will be formally submitted to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for approval, in accordance with the statutory requirements (Statutory Instrument No. 122 of 2010).</p>  <p>  I would hope in the coming weeks to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the 29 Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM process.</p></reply>

Relevant issues relating to the effective operation of each board, including those such as diversity, gender balance and mix of expertise and skill sets are for each Minister to consider. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Guidelines, compliance with the Government Decision of 23 July 2014 on Gender Balance on State Boards is an essential requirement.  These requirements include:-   </p>  <p>  - Each Department should prepare a plan to reaffirm and achieve the target of at  least 40% for representation of each gender on State Boards within its remit during the lifetime of the present Government.  </p>  <p>  - Departments should maintain a  particular focus on those Boards on which either women or men are currently significantly under-represented and should actively seek to appoint candidates of the under-represented gender from the PAS short list.  </p>  <p>  - Departments  should in the case of Boards which have already achieved the 40% target seek to move towards 45% of each gender as a new  target for gender  equality.  </p>  <p>  Indications are that 48% of State boards have reached the target of a minimum of 40% female membership set by the Government and indeed that some 35% of boards have met the higher 45% target.  This compares very favourably with the private sector, with a figure of somewhere around 13% female participation.  The position on individual State boards is a matter for the relevant Minister.</p>  <p>  Up to the end of September 2017, over 500 appointments have been made under the new system.  Some 30% of over 8,700 applications received for state board appointment came from women, who made up some 45% of the appointments made. </p>  <p>  The Board of the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is the only State Board under the aegis of my Department.  The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, which established PAS, specifies that the chairperson and ordinary members of the Board shall be appointed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in consultation with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  </p>  <p>  The Act also specifies that in appointing persons as members of the Board the Minister shall ensure that: </p>  <p>  - at least 2 of them have either or both civil service and other public service experience and knowledge which the Minister  considers relevant, and </p>  <p>  - at  least 2 of them have expertise in human resource management, customer service and recruitment outside the public service which the Minister considers relevant.</p>  <p>  Up until recently, five of the nine members (or 55%) were women, including the 3 positions recruited through the State Board process operated by PAS. However, two of these three positions are currently vacant but are in the process of being filled through the PAS process and the issue of gender balance will be considered along with other issues. There is also a third vacancy which is normally filled following a recommendation from the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

As a consequence public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts and applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social contributions.  They must also be compliant with relevant labour law.  These requirements are set out in the template documents used in tendering for goods and services which have been developed by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. </p>  <p>  The management of a tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to assess that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p>  <p>  Once awarded, the conditions of the public works contracts require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site.  Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that employment law and its enforcement, in both public and private contracts, is a matter for the relevant State authorities, including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

The legislation distinguishes between public servants who are covered by the agreement and public servants who are not covered by the agreement.  It provides a nine month delay in pay increases for public servants who are not covered by the Agreement.  This issue was debated extensively in both Houses of Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The legislation allows ICTU to provide umbrella confirmation of coverage on behalf of its affiliate unions. Importantly, while individual unions have voted to reject the agreement, the PSSA has been accepted by a majority vote of the Public Services Committee of ICTU.</p>  <p>  Accordingly ICTU has now notified the WRC of its assent to be bound by the terms of the agreement, therefore provisions applicable to non-covered public servants will not arise for members affiliated to ICTU, including members in the teachers unions.</p></reply>

The Act, alongside an FOI Code of Practice, seeks to bring about greater efficiency, consistency and promote best practice in the operation of FOI throughout public bodies.  </p><p>FOI gives rise to significant challenges.  The number, nature and complexity of requests continues to grow.  To support the effective implementation of FOI, the FOI Central Policy Unit at my Department oversees a training framework to ensure consistency in standards and approach and over 9,000 participants have receiving training.  The Central Policy Unit also provides ongoing support and advice to citizens and to FOI bodies through its website, <i>www.foi.gov.ie</i>and helpdesk and has presented at a number of conferences and training events.  Networks for FOI Bodies have been established which provide an excellent means of sharing learning and expertise, assisting in the development of common approaches and facilitating the transfer of learning between FOI bodies. </p><p>Some 30,417 FOI requests were processed by public bodies in 2016, a record number and a doubling of the number reached under the previous Act, with some 73% of those requests granted either in full or in part.  It is also worth noting that in only 3% of cases did requesters avail of the review mechanism available to them.  Furthermore, only 1.5% of requesters seek an independent review by the Information Commissioner.  The steps taken by my Department and the low level of appeals gives some indication of the progress being made in the implementation of the 2014 Act and the general satisfaction of requesters.  As such I have no plans to further reform the freedom of information regime at this time.</p></reply>

The Memorandum notes the OPW requirement that, when assessing exposure to flood risk, insurers take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed flood defence schemes. </p>  <p>  The Memorandum of Understanding does not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations concerned.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1st June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the Office of Public Works to Insurance Ireland in respect of twelve completed flood defence schemes; showing the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Details of a further five schemes were provided in January 2015 and details of the Waterford Flood Defence Scheme were provided last year. </p>  <p>  Under this Memorandum of Understanding, Insurance Ireland provides the OPW with details of the level of policies that include flood risk insurance within the benefitting areas of these schemes. </p>  <p>  To date OPW has provided details to Insurance Ireland on 18 completed schemes nationally and Insurance Ireland surveys its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in these areas.  The results of the most recent survey indicated that 83% of property insurance policies in these areas include cover against flood risk. </p>  <p>  The Department of Finance and the OPW meet with Insurance Ireland on a quarterly basis in order to address issues in relation to this transfer of data.  The most recent of these meetings took place on December 8th 2017 and the next meeting is scheduled for early March.</p>  <p>  The recent meetings, while not exclusively, have focused on the flood cover in areas protected by demountable defences.  The insurance sector has acknowledged that demountable defences are designed and when properly erected meet the desired standard.  The OPW has, in recent months given Insurance Ireland detailed information it sought to explain the protocols and procedures in place to maintain, test and erect demountable defences.  Discussions are continuing with the Department of Finance to explore options to address the industry&rsquo;s concerns about the &lsquo;human element&rsquo; of demountable defences.</p>  <p>  Separately the OPW and Department of Finance are working with the insurance sector to baseline flood cover ahead of schemes being completed.  This will provide a &lsquo;before and after&rsquo; of flood insurance cover for each community to be protected in the future; and give a baseline to be able to address any concerns about the levels of cover being reported. </p>  <p>  Any person with an insurance-related query or complaint can contact Insurance Ireland's Insurance Information Service (01 676 1914 or iis@insuranceireland.eu).  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman (1890 88 20 90) deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.</p></reply>

In recent years, Government spending has been managed in a sustainable and prudent manner with public expenditure growing at a lower rate than growth in the economy overall.  Steady, incremental progress in public expenditure, and the intensification of reform and innovation across the public service, will continue to support delivery of our social and economic priorities.  In particular, public expenditure has a key role to play in safeguarding economic growth through efficient and effective public capital investment. </p>  <p>  The Spending Review 2017 took place during the first half of last year and was the first in a series of rolling, selective reviews which will cover the totality of Government spending over a three year period to 2019.  The results of the first year of this new approach were published with the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2017 and included key sectoral trend analysis and a number of individual topic papers.  Building on the output of the 2017 Spending Review, the intention is that the Spending Review in 2018 will further reinforce the more structured and systematic means of analysing spending focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability.</p>  <p>  Investment in public infrastructure is essential to support balanced regional growth and to increase the capacity of the economy over the long-run.  Following the review of the Capital Plan in 2017, on Budget day last year I announced an additional allocation for capital investment of &euro;4.3 billion over the next four years, up to the end of our existing Capital Plan in 2021.  This will allow our State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects over the medium term while also ensuring communities and businesses can plan ahead.</p>  <p>  Turning to Corporation Tax, as the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Finance published its Annual Taxation Report last week. This Report provides details of the role this tax head plays in the overall composition of Exchequer tax revenues. </p>  <p>  In relation to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Ireland is one of the most globalised nations in the world and Foreign Direct Investment has been a key contributor to economic development and growth.  Regarding this, our competitive corporation tax regime has been an important part of our industrial policy since the 1950s.  However, there are many criteria on which companies base the location of their activity, of which taxation is just one.  Factors such as availability of physical and technological infrastructure, availability of skilled staff, the level and scale of technological innovation, the regulatory environment and political stability are also significant considerations. </p>  <p>  An effective education system supports economic growth.  This year &euro;10 billion has been allocated to the Education sector. This investment is important not alone in supporting inward investment but also nurturing indigenous businesses and fostering innovation.</p></reply>

The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. </p>  <p>  In this regard, public procurement rules include provisions that allow Member States to require a contractor to comply with EU and National legislation on the protection of labour rights.  As a consequence public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts and applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social contributions.  They must also be compliant with relevant labour law.  These requirements are set out in the template documents used in tendering for goods and services which have been developed by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. </p>  <p>  The management of a tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to assess that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p>  <p>  Once awarded, the conditions of the public works contracts require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site.  Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that employment law and its enforcement, in both public and private contracts, is a matter for the relevant State authorities, including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

It is also important to stress that we have taken a number of significant steps to improve the long-term sustainability of public service pensions in recent times.  </p><p>For example, the Single Public Service Pension Scheme introduced from 2013 will, in time, reduce liabilities by around 35% from what would otherwise have been the case.</p><p>Additionally, under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill (Act) 2017 we are making provision for the introduction of an Additional Superannuation Contribution by public servants.  This will increase current employee pension contributions from over &euro;700m per annum to &euro;1.25bn in 2019, thus providing substantial additional ongoing funding support towards the cost of public service pensions from those that benefit from such pensions.  </p><p>Furthermore, I recently announced an increase in the compulsory retirement age from 65 to 70 for public servants recruited before 1 April 2004. This will also assist in reducing the time period over which pension payments will be paid to those public service employees who opt to remain in work longer.</p><p>The cost of public service occupational pensions is expected to increase from 1.2% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% of GDP by 2040. However, the cost is expected to reduce thereafter with a cost of 0.9% of GDP expected by 2060.  The reductions in projected public service occupational pension expenditure over the long term arise largely as a result of the integration of public service pensions with the State Pension Contributory for employees who joined the public service after 6<sup></sup>April 1995, the subsequent increase in the minimum retirement age for new entrants from 2004, as well as the introduction of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme as noted above.</p><p>The full report is published on my Department's website at the following link.</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The companies&rsquo; register must also be accessible by any person or organisation which can demonstrate a legitimate interest.  There is no requirement under 4AMLD for full public access to the beneficial ownership register for Companies. </p>  <p>  Similarly, the central register of beneficial ownership for trusts with a tax consequence must be accessible by competent authorities and Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) for the purposes of combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.</p>  <p>  The provisions of these articles are currently being transposed by way of statutory instruments and are at an advanced stage.  It is anticipated that these will be largely concluded by the end of March 2018.</p>  <p>  Since 4AMLD was agreed, a number of further amendments were proposed by the Commission which are commonly referred to as the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD).  Among the proposals were transparency related changes with regard to the central registers of beneficial ownership.  In December, under the Estonian EU Presidency, agreement was reached between Council and the European Parliament - the co-legislators - on 5AMLD. </p>  <p>  Included in the changes are measures related to access to beneficial ownership registers. 5AMLD also extends the deadlines for transposition of the amendments to the 4AMLD which relate to the creation, operation and access to the central registers of beneficial ownership.  However, until such time as the 5AMLD is published in the Official Journal and comes into force there is no timeline currently set for its transposition into domestic legal frameworks.  In the meantime, preliminary work will continue on the necessary transposition of 5AMLD into domestic legislation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-18a.111.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011800056#WRC01600"><p>I would not agree with the Deputy that a disproportionate amount of State revenue is generated in Dublin city and county.  Taxes are not levied geographically so revenue is generated according to where taxpayers, individual or corporate, are based and obviously a significant number of these are in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners produce an annual report on the distribution of identifiable net taxation receipts by county, covering the main elements of all the major tax headings though I would note that not all tax headings are amenable to being reported on a county basis.  The report indicates that for 2016, approximately &euro;20.8 billion or around 56 per cent of the total net receipts, which can be classified by county, is derived from Dublin.  This is broadly in line with the concentration of economic activity in Dublin. The report can be viewed at<i></i></p><p>I would note also, that in the case of LPT (Local Property Tax), statistics published by the Revenue Commissioners indicate that in 2017 LPT returns were made in respect of 1.906 million properties and that &euro;448 million was collected in LPT.  The four Dublin local authorities (Dublin City, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Fingal and South Dublin) comprise in the order of 515,400 of these properties or 27% of the total.  Of the total LPT collected in 2017, &euro;167.6 million, or 37% came from these four local authorities.  LPT is based on the market value of a property and the yield from the Dublin authorities reflects the higher market values of properties in urban areas.  Full details can be found at <i>https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/lpt/local-property-tax-2017.pdf </i>Again, I would not consider these figures to be disproportionate.</p><p>That said, the Deputy will be aware of commitments made in respect of regional development in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  In particular I would draw his attention to the draft National Planning Framework developed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and also the Action Plan for Jobs Strategy coordinated by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (D/BEI) which has, as one of its key initiatives, stimulating regional growth.  D/BEI are aware that creating more jobs in the regions is a priority and they note that since 2011, jobs created by multinationals in regional Ireland have increased by 28% and there are now over 122,000 people employed in 649 different IDA Ireland client companies outside of Dublin. However, while progress has been made, more work remains to be done. We are certainly focused on doing everything we can to deliver the fairest possible spread of investment across the country.</p><p>My own Department operates a number of tax incentives to encourage investment and of course these are open to all eligible individuals or organisations, nationwide.  In particular I would note that Section 486C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a three-year relief from corporation tax on the trading income and certain gains of new start-up companies, with the value of the relief being linked to the amount of employer&rsquo;s PRSI paid by a company, the measure is intended to encourage economic activity and employment throughout Ireland.  The relief is available for the first three years of trading and companies with a total corporation tax liability of up to &euro;40,000 in a year can qualify.  It was extended by Finance Act 2015 to end December 2018.</p><p>In addition the &lsquo;Key Employee Engagement Programme&rsquo; (KEEP), announced in Budget 2018, seeks to support small to medium enterprises throughout the country.  KEEP has the objective of assisting SME&rsquo;s in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises to recruit and retain key employees.  Such companies with growth potential may not have the cash resources available to offer comparable salary packages to large, established businesses.  However, where the employee believes in the growth potential of the firm, and by extension the potential for the company shares to increase in value, remuneration in the form of share options may improve the attractiveness of the SME employment offer.  KEEP provides that the value of the benefit to the employee on exercise of a qualifying share option will be subject to tax when the employee subsequently disposes of the shares, i.e. when sales proceeds would be available to pay the tax due.  In the absence of this incentive, the share-option gain would be liable to income tax, USC and PRSI at the time of the exercise of the option. </p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the Insurance Act 1964, as amended, monies may be paid out of the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF), with the approval of the High Court, in relation to an insolvent insurer, to meet claims up to a limit of 65% or &euro;825,000 of the claim, whichever is the lesser.</p>  <p>  With regard to the payments in relation to Setanta Insurance, there have been two applications to the High Court for the payment of compensation from the ICF.  An Order was granted in the High Court in October 2016 in respect of 249 first party claims and 1,795 windscreen claims at a cost to the ICF of &euro;608,085.14.  Subsequent to the Supreme Court judgment, an Order was granted in the High Court in July 2017 in respect of 324 claims at a cost to the ICF of &euro;6,479,336.85.  Therefore, the total amount paid out of the ICF to date in relation to Setanta Insurance is &euro;7,087,421.99.</p>  <p>  The liquidator for Setanta Insurance has informed me that as of 31 December 2017, there are 1,577 active claims, of these 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limits.</p>  <p>  Section 3B(1)(a) of the Insurance Act 1964, as inserted by Section 4 of the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011, provides that applications to the High Court may be made by the Accountant of the Courts of Justice, where the insurer in liquidation is authorised in a Member State other than Ireland, not more than once in every 6 month period.</p>  <p>  This provision was inserted to ensure that excessive legal and administrative costs are not imposed on the ICF and to enable claims to be made in respect of a number of policyholders at a time rather than in respect of each policyholder individually.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that heads of the Insurance (Amendment) Bill were approved by Government in July and then sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for priority drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  This legislation based on the recommendations of the Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland will amend the relevant Insurance Acts to, inter alia, reduce the limitation on the frequency of applications to the High Court to a 3 month interval.</p>  <p>  No date has been fixed for the next payment from the ICF, but the Liquidator has informed me that preparatory work is underway in respect of some 275 claims to the value of c &euro;5.8m, with a view to the Accountant to the High Court making an application before the end of March.  It is important to note that only claims which have been settled can be included in applications to the High Court for payment from the ICF.  The process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties. </p></reply>

Consequently, there is no equivalent arrangement to the Declined Cases Agreement which operates for third party motor cover.  </p>  <p>  Having said that, the Government is aware of the difficulties that the rising cost of liability insurance in recent years has had on many businesses and that is why the Cost of Insurance Working Group was asked to examine the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors as part of its second phase of work.  I recently received its report from the Chair, Minister of State D'Arcy, on this matter and subject to Government approval, I am proposing to publish the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  As part of its work the Cost of Insurance Working Group engaged in a consultative process and a significant issue raised by stakeholders during consultations was the lack of competition in the liability insurance market overall and the particular problems faced by specific business activities in obtaining adequate cover at a reasonable price.</p>  <p>  The Working Group recognised that, in practical terms, businesses by and large would be unable to continue functioning on a day-to-day basis without the &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; afforded by having such cover in place.  Moreover, a number of more-regulated sectors which require the issuing of some form of licence in order to legally operate make the purchase of such insurance, in effect, obligatory.  Consequently, the focus of the Working Group was primarily on what can be done to address the issue of increasing insurance costs in addition to making Ireland a more attractive place for new insurance providers to enter.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the implementation of the recommendations in this Report, building upon the work undertaken in the motor insurance phase, will cumulatively not only lead to greater stability in the pricing of employer liability and public liability insurance, but also help to increase the capacity of the provision of such types of insurance to all forms of relevant organisations.  </p>  <p>  However, for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service which can be contacted by email at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu or by phone 01-6761914. </p></reply>

As can be seen from this table the primary drivers behind the increase are the &lsquo;Exchequer borrowing requirement&rsquo; and &lsquo;Change in Exchequer deposits&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The Exchequer borrowing requirement forecasts reflect, inter alia, increased capital investment and contributions to the Rainy Day Fund but prudently exclude any assumptions around the State&rsquo;s disposal of shareholding in a number of financial institutions, which represents an upside risk to these projections. </p>  <p>  The debt estimates reflect pre-funding ahead of large bond maturities in 2019 and 2020.  This is reflected as an increase in Exchequer deposits in 2018 and, to a lesser extent, in 2019.  This increase is temporary and unwinds in 2020.</p>  <p>  Both general government gross debt and net debt, expressed in per cent of both GDP and modified GNI (or GNI*), are expected to continue to continue declining over the forecast period.  This is consistent with the fiscal forecasts that show a continued decline in the Exchequer borrowing requirement and a general government surplus in 2020 that is expected to increase in 2021.</p>  <p>  Table A4 shows the interest expenditure expressed in cash terms, per cent of tax revenue and per cent of GDP.  As can be seen from this table, both the national debt cash interest and interest on an ESA 2010 basis (i.e. GG interest) are declining.  The difference between the two measures, largely accounted for by accrual and consolidation adjustments is also shown in this table.</p>  <p>  The average interest rate, shown in table 15, is 2.9 per cent in 2017. It is forecast to decline to 2.4 per cent by 2021.</p></reply>

There are 4 Votes in the Finance Group: The Department of Finance, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the Tax Appeals Commission. </p><p>A sum of &euro;25m (rounded to the nearest million) is profiled as Capital for the Finance Vote Group in the December 2017 fiscal monitor.  Allocations were made under two Votes; &euro;23m to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and &euro;2.3m to the Department of Finance net of any capital carryover from 2016. The &euro;19m outturn included in the fiscal monitor relates to Revenue&rsquo;s expenditure.  Of the &euro;6m variance, &euro;4m applies to Revenue and the &euro;2m to the Department of Finance.  The reasons for the variances are set out below:</p><p><b>Vote 9 - Revenue Commissioners:  </b></p><p>Total expenditure by Revenue on Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Capital and Current, amounts to &euro;54.2m or 46.4% of Revenue&rsquo;s total non-pay costs in 2017. Continued investment in ICT has been a major driver of productivity growth in Revenue, as well as enabling better service levels for the public and enhanced governance.  Every year Revenue needs to develop and implement a series of urgent ICT projects that ensure Revenue&rsquo;s ICT infrastructure can support budgetary and legislative changes as introduced by the Government or the EU, very frequently within tight timeframes. </p><p>The information in the fiscal monitor is based on data available as at 18 December 2017.  Revenue&rsquo;s Capital expenditure largely relates to expenditure on ICT.  A considerable lead-in time for final classification between Capital and Current ICT expenditure is required; as such issues as the timing of the roll-out and operationalisation of ICT products are factored into the classification process.  Following a number of end year adjustments and re-classifications, Revenue&rsquo;s Capital expenditure amount was subsequently increased from &euro;19m to &euro;20.3m.  This has reduced Revenue&rsquo;s variance to &euro;2.7m. Some &euro;2m of this amount was spent in 2017, but was classified as Current expenditure.  However, in line with standard practice relating to the timing of final classifications between Capital and Current expenditure on ICT projects, it is anticipated that further re-classifications from Current to Capital expenditure will be completed by end Quarter 1, 2018.</p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s total administrative budget expenditure in 2017 amounted to &euro;408.7m, or 99.8% of Revenue&rsquo;s administrative budget allocation. </p><p><b>Vote 7 &ndash; Department of Finance</b></p><p>Regarding the underspend in the <b>Department of Finance vote</b>, a capital allocation of &euro;2.3m was made, &euro;0.7m for IT related capital spend, and &euro;1.6m for Facilities related capital spend. </p><p>Funds originally allocated for fitting out a premises the Department was going to locate some staff in specifically to provide new ICT hardware, however as the Department will not now be re-locating staff to those offices these funds were not spent.</p><p>There was an underspend on the capital allocation made for eDiscovery as the project concerned started later than anticipated. </p><p>There was an underspend on the capital allocation made for the Print room as some items were not considered essential given the functionality of machines actually procured. In addition, the actual cost of the machines procured came in below the capital allocation made.</p><p>In total there was an underspend compared to budget of &euro;0.6m on IT related capital spend. </p><p>A Capital allocation for 2017 of approximately &euro;1.6m was made to the Facilities Management Unit. Spending in 2017 amounted to &euro;0.2m resulting in an underspend of &euro;1.4m.</p><p>The underspend in relation to the Facilities Management Unit of the Department is due mainly to the fact that progress on projects planned for 2017 was slower than expected.</p><p>Three projects in particular accounted for bulk of the underspend broken down as follows:</p><p>An enhancement of physical security arrangements in South Block Government Buildings, which was estimated to cost in region of &euro;0.3m, and originally planned for Q3, 2017 will not be completed until 2018.</p><p>The relocation of circa 120 staff from the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to new accommodation in Miesian Plaza, Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2 did not take place as expected in Q4, 2017 due to delays in preparing the accommodation for occupancy.  An amount of &euro;0.4m in respect of outfitting of the new accommodation had been included in the 2017 estimate.</p><p>Activity aimed primarily at addressing heating and ventilation issues at 7-9 Merrion Row, Dublin 2 did not advance at the rate originally expected in 2017.  An amount of &euro;0.6m had been allocated towards the planned works in the 2017 estimate.</p><p>In addition to the foregoing, delays in a number of smaller projects originally planned for commencement in the latter end of 2017, e.g. enhancement works to off-site document storage facilities, meant that the related spending did not materialise in 2017. </p></reply>

Public expenditure is of particular importance in this regard, in terms of protecting growth through investment in our social and economic priorities by way of efficient and effective spending. </p>  <p>  Effective management of the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Departments.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact during the year with all other Government Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. Information in relation to gross and net voted expenditure is published monthly in the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Fiscal Monitor.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the Government has managed spending in a sustainable and prudent manner, with growth in public expenditure increasing at a lower rate than growth in the economy overall. The reforms put in place since the economic crisis, such as the implementation of the medium-term expenditure framework, the performance budgeting initiative, the Spending Review process, etc. have all played a part in putting our public finances on the stable footing they are on today. Steady, incremental progress in public expenditure, alongside a continuing focus on value for money, will help to keep us on a sustainable path, thereby ensuring long lasting benefits for the people and the economy. </p>  <p>  Public capital investment is a key component of supporting balanced regional growth in all sectors of our economy and increasing the capacity of our economy in the long-term. The review of the Capital Plan, carried out in 2017, reflects where sectoral gaps exist. The review sought to assess how enhancing investment in public infrastructure can support resilience in the economy, particularly in the context of Brexit, climate change and the potential for overheating as our economy approaches full capacity. This review is based on robust analysis and has provided a useful evidence base to support planning going forward.</p>  <p>  Turning to revenue, the Department of Finance last week published its Annual Taxation Report. The Report notes that taxation receipts have recovered from their post-crisis nadir and, at the end of last year, the level of receipts was the highest on record. Against this backdrop, the report examines taxation trends since the beginning of the last decade to deepen the understanding of developments and to monitor and highlight key issues, including the emergence of any imbalances.</p></reply>

This was in addition to the additional &euro;2.2 billion for housing already allocated prior to that for the implementation of the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  These funding allocations were, inter alia, intended to address bottlenecks and infrastructural deficits, informed and advised by the detailed analysis and assessment carried out in the context of the recent review of the 2015 capital plan Building on Recovery which I published in September.   </p>  <p>  Consequently, between 2014 and 2021, public capital expenditure in Ireland will have more than doubled and as set out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment in Ireland moving to amongst the highest in the EU.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this new planned level of public capital investment represents an appropriate balance between the need for additional investment to realise the economy's long-term growth potential, the capacity of the economy to deliver additional public infrastructure consistent with fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability, and the need to adhere to the responsible spending path agreed by Government with reference to the requirements of the EU Fiscal Rules.  </p>  <p>  Work is currently at an advanced stage by my Department in preparing a new long-term 10-year capital plan covering the period 2018-2027.  The primary objective of the new 10-year plan is to underpin the implementation of the new National Planning Framework for spatial policy under the Ireland 2040 Plan.  The assessment of priorities for public capital investment over that period will also be strongly informed by the detailed Infrastructure Capacity and Demand Analysis prepared by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES), as part of the recent review of the 2015 capital plan, which assessed key drivers of infrastructure demand in a number of areas such as housing, health, transport and education.  The Infrastructure Capacity and Demand analysis was published alongside the review of the current capital plan and is available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  I would hope that the new 10-year capital plan will be considered by Government in the near future, with decisions on capital allocations in support of the various sectoral investment plans then being made in due course.  I should point out, however, that responsibility for the selection and approval of individual infrastructure project proposals to be progressed in each sector, such as road or rail projects in transport or hospital capacity increases in health, are a matter in the first instance for the relevant sectoral Minister and his or her Department - subject to compliance with the requirements of the Public Spending Code in relation to planning, assessment and appraisal of project proposals in the normal way - rather than for my Department.</p></reply>

All Departments are responsible for ensuring projects meet with the appropriate regulatory requirements including environmental impact assessments.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p>  <p>  When carrying out procurement procedures, contracting authorities require suppliers to comply with a wide variety of legislation in areas that would include taxation, social policy, the environment and employment law.  Compliance with the legislation covering these areas is rightly a matter for the relevant Departments and/or Agencies.</p>  <p>  Recently revised public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in Regulation 57 of S.I. No. 284 of 2016 &ndash; European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016 and Article 57 (4a) and Recitals (100) and (101) of Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement.  Before an applicant, in relation to certain breaches, is excluded, they may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded.  The contracting authority must consider this evidence before deciding whether to exclude or include an applicant.  In addition, the qualifying tenderer must submit signed declarations stating that none of the circumstances (e.g. participation in a criminal organisation, corruption, terrorist offences etc.) outlined in Regulation 57 of S.I. No. 284 or Article 57 of 2014/24/EU apply.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for developing and setting out the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland.  In this regard, the OGP has developed the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which consists of 5 strands:</p>  <p>  - Legislation (Directives, Regulations)</p>  <p>  - Government Policy (Circulars, etc.)</p>  <p>  - Capital Works Management Framework for Public Works</p>  <p>  - General Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services</p>  <p>  - More detailed technical guidelines, template documentation and information notes as issued periodically by the OGP</p>  <p>  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procurement procedures to be followed by public bodies.</p>  <p>  In July last year, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules.  Whilst these guidelines have been designed to facilitate Public Bodies in meeting their corporate governance requirements in relation to procurement, it is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that they comply with EU and national rules in this regard.</p></reply>

It includes a provision that the Minister may direct two or more schools to co-operate with each other in the admission process to provide for a more effective and efficient use of resources.</p><p>The Bill also provides for schools to share information with each other in respect of applications received, offers made and offers accepted for the purposes of facilitating the efficient admission of students.  The provision incudes a capacity for a Board of Management to share information with another board or patron in respect of applications for admission and offers of admission that have been made or accepted.</p><p>These provisions seek to address the practice of parents making applications or accepting offers for multiple schools and should make the enrolment process more effective and efficient for both schools and applicants.</p></reply>

The RSE policy should reflect the core values and ethos of the school as outlined in the school&rsquo;s mission statement. Where spiritual, moral or ethical issues arise when teaching RSE, the school&rsquo;s RSE policy should guide teachers in the treatment of such issues, in accordance with the ethos of the school. However, elements of the programme, such as family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation, cannot be omitted on the grounds of school ethos, regardless of who is delivering, or assisting in the delivery of, the RSE programme in the school.</p>  <p>  My Department provides clear guidance to schools on the engagement of outside speakers and on the use of external resources to assist in delivering the curriculum. These guidelines are outlined in circulars 0022/2010 and 0023/2010 for primary and post-primary schools respectively.  These circulars are currently being updated. </p>  <p>  Where an outside speaker is engaged by a school, he or she should be engaged in the context of delivering a planned and comprehensive programme in the school.  He or she should not be brought in to replace the school programme but to enhance it. It is the responsibility of the school to ensure that outside speakers are aware of the school policy on RSE and child protection and their input should be delivered in that context. My Department recommends and provides guidance that the class teacher should always be present in the class in order that he or she is aware of what is being delivered and can ensure that this is in accordance with the school's policy. Parents should also be informed when external speaker/agencies are engaged. Programmes delivered by visitors or external agencies must use appropriate evidence-based methodologies with clear educational outcomes. </p>  <p>  Circulars 22/2010 and 23/2010 also require that all materials proposed for use by external providers must be approved in advance by the principal and Board of Management, be age and stage appropriate for pupils and be in line with the ethos of the school, and the principles of the SPHE curriculum. There is also a requirement to take account of all relevant school policies and procedures, including the school&rsquo;s child protection policy, Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) policy and substance misuse policy.</p></reply>

As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the area referred to by the Deputy will be kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated data.</p></reply>

Resulting from this, I recently announced 26 new programmes that have been approved for further development into national apprenticeships.  These programmes span a wide range of skills and sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture and are listed in the attached table. It is estimated that the development timeframe will take between 12 and 15 months.  </p><p>There is no specific cost associated with each of the ten steps in developing national apprenticeships.  Overall development funding is set by the lead proposer during the application stage.  It is paid in two allocations, 50% at the beginning of the development process once the Apprenticeship Council has approved the project plan (step 3)  and the balance on receipt of a project update, following formal approval of the apprenticeship occupational profile (step 5). <table><tr><th></th><th>Title of proposed apprenticeship </th><th>Industry lead </th><th>Proposed coordinating provider </th></tr><tr><td>1. </td><td>Applied Horticulture <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 2 years <br /><br /></td><td>Teagasc </td><td>Teagasc </td></tr><tr><td>2. </td><td>Arboriculture <br /><br />Level 5   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Caseys Tree Care Ltd, <br /><br />North West Tree Care, <br /><br />Kilcoyne Tree Care, <br /><br />Arborist Ireland </td><td>Galway Roscommon ETB </td></tr><tr><td>3. </td><td>Associate Sales Professional <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 3 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Sales Sense </td><td>Mayo Sligo &amp;amp; Leitrim ETB </td></tr><tr><td>4. </td><td>CGI Technical Artist (Animation, <br /><br />Games, VFX)  <br /><br />Level 9   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Screen Training Ireland </td><td>Dublin IT  </td></tr><tr><td>5. </td><td>Equipment Systems Engineer </td><td>SL Controls </td><td>University of </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Level 9   Duration 2 years</td><td></td><td>Limerick  </td></tr><tr><td>6. </td><td>Farm Management <br /><br />Level 7   Duration 4 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Teagasc </td><td>Teagasc </td></tr><tr><td>7. </td><td>Farm Technician <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Teagasc </td><td>Teagasc </td></tr><tr><td>8. </td><td>Geo-Driller <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 3 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Geological Survey Ireland </td><td>IT Carlow  </td></tr><tr><td>9. </td><td>ICT Associate Professional in <br /><br />Cybersecurity <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>FastTrack into Technology (FIT) </td><td>FIT </td></tr><tr><td>10. </td><td>Lean Sigma Manager <br /><br />Level 9   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Teleflex  </td><td>University of Limerick  </td></tr><tr><td>11. </td><td>Logistics Associate  <br /><br />Level 6    Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Freight Transport Association Ireland  </td><td>Dublin IT  </td></tr><tr><td>12. </td><td>Principal Engineer- Professional <br /><br />Doctorate  <br /><br />Level 10   Duration 4 years  <br /><br /></td><td>SL Controls </td><td>University of Limerick  </td></tr><tr><td>13. </td><td>Professional Bar Manager  Level 6   Duration 2 years</td><td>Vintners Association </td><td>Griffith College  </td></tr><tr><td>14. </td><td>Professional Hairdressing  <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 3 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Hairdressing Council of Ireland </td><td>Limerick &amp;amp; Clare ETB &amp;amp; Image Learning and Development Training Network Ltd </td></tr><tr><td>15. </td><td>Professional Healthcare Assistant <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Kiltipper Woods Care Centre </td><td>Griffith College  </td></tr><tr><td>16. </td><td>Quality Assurance Technician  <br /><br />Level 7   Duration 3 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Ibec Biopharma cluster  </td><td>IT Tallaght  </td></tr><tr><td>17. </td><td>Quality Laboratory Technician  <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Ibec Biopharma cluster  </td><td>IT Tallaght  </td></tr><tr><td>18. </td><td>Senior Quantity Surveyor  <br /><br />Level 9   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Society of Charted Surveyors Ireland  </td><td>Limerick Institute of Technology </td></tr><tr><td>19. </td><td>Recruitment Practitioner  <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>National Recruitment Federation  </td><td>National College of Ireland  </td></tr><tr><td>20. </td><td>Scaffolding  <br /><br />Level 6   Duration 3 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Construction Industry Federation </td><td>Laois &amp;amp; Offaly ETB  </td></tr><tr><td>21. </td><td>Software System Designer  <br /><br />Level 9   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Lero  </td><td>University of Limerick  </td></tr><tr><td>22. </td><td>SportTurf Management Level 6   Duration 2 years</td><td>Teagasc </td><td>Teagasc </td></tr><tr><td>23. </td><td>Stud Farm Management <br /><br />Level 7   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>Teagasc </td><td>Teagasc  </td></tr><tr><td>24. </td><td>Supply Chain Associate <br /><br /> Level 7   Duration 3 years  <br /><br /></td><td>IPICS The Supply Chain Management Institute </td><td>University of Limerick  </td></tr><tr><td>25. </td><td>Supply Chain Manager <br /><br />Level 9   Duration 2 years  <br /><br /></td><td>IPICS The Supply Chain Management Institute </td><td>University of Limerick </td></tr><tr><td>26. </td><td>Supply Chain Specialist <br /><br />Level 8   Duration 2 years</td><td>IPICS The Supply Chain Management Institute </td><td>University of Limerick </td></tr></table></p></reply>

A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union level, and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. </p>  <p>  Persons making an application for a certificate of naturalisation are required to provide satisfactory evidence of their identity and nationality.  This is usually in the form of a currently valid passport and may include other original supporting documents, such as a previously held or out of date passport, birth certificate and marriage certificate.  In rare circumstances where an applicant cannot produce their current passport, or a previous passport, birth certificate or other supporting documents the applicant will be required to provide a full explanation.  Such explanation should, where possible, be supported by satisfactory evidence that they have attempted to obtain such documentation and correspondence from the relevant authorities or embassy responsible for the issuing of passports and birth certificates in their country, clearly stating the reasons the documentation cannot be provided.  INIS will consider the explanation given and, if satisfied it is for reasons genuinely beyond the applicant's control, may suggest alternative means to the person to assist in establishing their identity and nationality.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

When all necessary information has been compiled the application will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  As the processing requirements and the time taken to complete the necessary checks vary from case to case, it is not possible to indicate when a decision will be given in respect of his application.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay, however, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  Occasionally it may arise that the consideration of an application may require to be revisited.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Ireland is the only EU country that specifically chose to voluntarily opt in to participate in the EU relocation programme and the IRPP was the body responsible for delivering on our commitments in that regard.  While the EU relocation programme ran until September 2017, Ireland continues to transfer asylum seekers from Greece who have been approved and who fall within an eligible nationality.  Under the provisions of the EU relocation programme, persons considered for relocation had to be from countries with an EU-wide recognition rate for international protection of at least 75%.  As Afghanistan did not meet this criterion, persons from there would not have been eligible for transfer to any other EU Member State, including Ireland, under the relocation programme. </p>  <p>  In common with other EU Member States, Ireland is not in a position to accept direct requests for asylum from individuals in another state. </p></reply>

Its core objective is to avail of those opportunities to increase the market for international legal services in Ireland that may emerge on foot of Brexit.  As such, it is an initiative which is a natural fit with the responses being taken across our various services sectors by way of coming together under a national Brexit strategy.  It also coincides with the decision by the European Council on 15 December 2017 allowing the Article 50 negotiations on Brexit to move into their second phase.  The Bar of Ireland is to be commended on its ongoing work to advocate and develop this initiative with the Law Society, the wider legal community, IDA Ireland and key stakeholders including my own and other relevant Government departments who have come on board.  While it continues to be work in progress, it is my intention to brief Cabinet colleagues and to propose the formal endorsement of this initiative by the Government when it has reached the appropriate stage. </p>  <p>  In the development of this initiative consideration will, of course, be given to any relevant capacity issues.  At the same time, it should be recognised that any resulting increase in employment opportunities which may arise for graduates entering the legal professions, who will come forward each year from a variety of academic backgrounds, will occur incrementally over a period of time.  In light of this and of indications that there is something of an ongoing surfeit or equilibrium of qualifying legal professionals, it is my understanding that a shortfall in graduates entering the legal professions of the kind raised by the Deputy can be avoided. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has a number of reporting functions in relation to the provision of legal professional education.  At present, for example, it is putting the practical arrangements in place for the provision, on foot of appropriate public consultations, of the required statutory report in relation to the education and training (including ongoing training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners, including the manner in which such education and training is provided.  This report, which has to be provided within two years of the Authority&rsquo;s establishment day which was 1 October 2016, will cover those matters set out within section 34 of the 2015 Act.  </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>The Garda strength of the Cavan/Monaghan Division on 30 November 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, was 323 with 11 Garda Reserves and 37 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 40 have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,552 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b></b></p></reply>

The provisional outturn of capital expenditure was &euro;546.53 million, leaving some &euro;8.47 million in capital monies remaining.  Of this, &euro;8 million was converted to current moneys and expended by year end as part of the Department&rsquo;s contribution to the new Brexit Loan Scheme.  This was done through a technical Supplementary Estimate approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas in December 2017.</p><p>The Supplementary Estimate contained a total package of &euro;40 million in current and capital monies being redistributed from already voted monies across my Department&rsquo;s Vote last year.  This funding package was as follows:</p><p>- &euro;14 million in current monies to provide towards the new Brexit Loan Scheme to SMEs (Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises) impacted by Brexit.</p><p>- An additional &euro;12 million in capital monies to pay off some of the remaining commitments under Cycle 5 of the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions.</p><p>- An additional &euro;10.6 million in capital monies being provided through Science Foundation Ireland to provide for cutting-edge research equipment.</p><p>- An additional &euro;2.4 million in capital monies to the Tyndall National Institute, Cork for its research facilities; and</p><p>- An additional &euro;1 million in capital monies to further support Irish companies participation in the European Space Agency programmes. </p><p>The funding capacity for the technical Supplementary Estimate arose from a combination of Capital and Current underspends arising across my Department&rsquo;s Vote and additional own resource income (ORI) being generated as follows:</p><p>- An additional &euro;13 million in ORI being generated through Enterprise Ireland (EI). EI is obliged to expend ORI first before drawing down exchequer funds and this therefore provided &euro;13 million in exchequer capital to be contributed to the Supplementary Estimate.</p><p>- &euro;12 million remaining unspent as part of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2017 Regional Funding plans.</p><p>- &euro;5 million in a combination of other Enterprise Ireland grant funded programmes which had not been claimed yet by client companies.</p><p>- &euro;3 million in relation to IDAs Regional Property Programme due to some delays on a number of projects across the country. This is not untypical given the nature of property investments which typically involve planning requirements, contractual issues, adverse weather conditions and tendering and procurement timelines.</p><p>- &euro;1 million in relation to the Interreg Programme as a consequence of delayed commencement of the programme due to UKs Brexit vote in 2016.</p><p>- &euro;3 million in Pay underspends across the Department and some of its Offices due to staff vacancies and some delays in recruitment.</p><p>- &euro;3 million in Non-pay underspends across the Department and some of its Offices for a variety of reasons including staff vacancies, reduced Legal Fees expenditure and some delays on accommodation related projects.  </p><p>It is important to note that good corporate governance procedures and the public financial rules means that Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will ensure payments of exchequer monies, be they on capital grants or for property solutions, will be on foot of presentation of matured liabilities or evidence that the terms and conditions of the grant awards has been met and requests for funding being supplied by client companies. </p></reply>

Nevertheless, as set out in the 2017 Competitiveness Challenge a range of threats have emerged, not least of which is the impact of Brexit.  I share the Council&rsquo;s view that Ireland must rigorously pursue cost competitiveness, address barriers to investment and growth, drive productivity performance and be responsive to competitiveness challenges and opportunities that are emerging.  As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my objective is to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and firm level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made in making it easier to start and run a business in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A range of policy challenges and recommendations for consideration by Government are identified by the Council in the Competitiveness Challenge report.  The report has been considered by Government and at Cabinet Committee.  The specifics of the challenges and recommendations range from short to long term actions.  In some cases, the Council&rsquo;s proposals address the need to complete or expedite ongoing work or to implement existing strategies. </p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with relevant Ministers through the Cabinet Committee structure to develop meaningful actions to enhance national competitiveness. In addition, actions to address competitiveness will be addressed as part of the 2018 Action Plan for Jobs.</p></reply>

The 2017 performance was strong, reporting the highest employment in the history of the agency, the highest net job creation in the history of the agency and the lowest number of job losses since 1998.</p><p>In 2017 EI supported client companies employed 209,338 people.  19,332 new jobs were created by EI backed companies in 2017. </p><p>This represents a net increase of 10,309 jobs for 2017, taking account of job losses.  The job creation figures are up on 2016, despite the uncertainty that Irish businesses faced in 2017 in the context of Brexit.</p><p>Job creation was evenly spread across the country, with every county seeing job increases.  Two thirds (64%) of the new jobs created were outside of Dublin.  The West, Mid-West and North West saw the largest level of increases at 7% in 2017. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland attributes this strong performance by Irish businesses to the continuing growth of an entrepreneurial climate for start-ups, allied to strong jobs growth in the Construction (8% increase), Engineering (8% increase), Lifesciences (8% increase), Digital Technology (6% increase), Electronics (6% increase), Food (4% increase) and ICT sectors (5% increase).</p><p>2017 was the first year of EI&rsquo;s strategy, <i>Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017 &ndash; 2020. </i>This Strategy is focused on:</p><p>- Assisting clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 while sustaining the existing record level of jobs;</p><p>- Growing the annual exports of client companies by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum;</p><p>- Increasing the level of spend made by client companies in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020; and</p><p>- Inspiring more Irish owned companies to have global ambition.</p><p>I am committed to work closely with Enterprise Ireland to drive this Strategy, to ensure that it continues to support companies in urban and rural areas to start, innovate, increase our exports and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future.  In recent months, with the support of my Department, EI has launched new measures to strengthen the rural and regional economy and to provide quicker access to innovation funding for exporting companies.  This includes the new &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund and a new fast-track Agile Innovation Fund. </p><p>Table 1 presents employment in Enterprise Ireland supported companies by county.

It will enable the Department and its Agencies to recruit a further forty to fifty staff to supplement existing staffing numbers.  Specifically, this additional &euro;3 million pay allocation has been factored in to the respective pay ceilings for the Department and Agencies as follows:<ul type="disc"><li>Enterprise Ireland (an additional &euro;1.3m), </li><li>IDA Ireland (an additional &euro;700k), </li><li>Science Foundation Ireland (an additional &euro;400k), </li><li>the Health and Safety Authority (an additional  &euro;400k) </li><li>Department (an additional &euro;200k).</li></ul>Furthermore, in the 2018 REV process, an amount of &euro;4m in the IDA&rsquo;s capital monies has been reclassified to Pay to sustain the IDA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Winning Abroad Programme&rdquo;.  This further increases the IDA staffing numbers by 35 posts.</p><p>It is not possible to be specific on the distribution of the additional posts across my Department and each State Agency in 2018 as staffing resources are reviewed as an ongoing priority to ensure my Department&rsquo;s continued ability to facilitate the wide mission and volume of work in a range of challenging policy areas.</p><p>My Department engages on an ongoing basis in workforce planning within the context of allocated funding, and with reallocation of staff across my Department as the needs of business units evolve. This will continue during 2018 with ongoing regular reviews of the appropriate staffing across my Department in response to emerging priorities.</p><p>I might also mention that my Department entered 2018 with a number of vacancies to be filled through recruitment in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service and/or advertising certain posts across the Civil Service to be filled under the Civil Service mobility programme.  Therefore, it is difficult to be precise as to how staffing levels will move during the year.  Nonetheless, I can inform the Deputy that staffing levels are closely monitored to ensure that we remain within pay-budget limits agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform having regard to key priorities and our workforce planning exercise.</p><p>Each Agency is provided with an overall Pay ceiling within which they have some flexibility to align their staffing resources to manage their overall operations and priorities.  In addition, some Agencies also have Own Resource Income, such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Health and Safety Authority and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, which they may wish to utilise to support their particular priority areas, be that to cover operational Pay costs or some Non-Pay costs, such as running promotional and awareness campaigns, to be agreed with my Department. As with the Department itself, responding to individual key strategic priorities and individual workforce planning exercises, each Agency works with my Department to ensure each remains within agreed pay-budget limits.</p></reply>

These arise in the context only of workplace inspections under employment law and health and safety activities, reflecting the respective responsibilities of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA).</p>  <p>  The Deputy refers also to the Report published in December 2017 by the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation on non-EEA crew in the Irish Fishing Fleet under the Atypical Worker Permission Scheme.  As outlined, I do not have lead policy responsibility for the fishing sector so the Report overall will fall to be considered by the Minister with responsibility for the fishing sector.</p>  <p>  However, I can confirm that my Department is examining this Report carefully in the context of any recommendations that come within my policy remit.  On a preliminary examination, the Report contains 12 recommendations of which 2 come within my area of responsibility and relate to the activities of the WRC.  My Department will engage with the WRC in the context of pursuing these recommendations. </p></reply>

Under the Regulation, Member States are given the power to enact national legislation to provide for country of origin labelling of specific types or categories of foods.  However, such national measures are only allowed, in accordance with Article 39(2), &ldquo;where there is a proven link between certain qualities of the food and its origin or provenance&rdquo;.  Additionally, the Member State must notify such measures to the Commission and &ldquo;shall provide evidence that the majority of consumers attach significant value to the provision of that information.&rdquo;  Under this notification procedure, Member States can only adopt the proposed measure if it has not received a negative opinion from the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  A number of Member States, including France, Italy and Spain, have provided for national mandatory indications of origin for certain food products.  The majority of these measures have been introduced on a trial basis and the Member States concerned have committed to report on the impact of these origin rules on the internal market.  The European Commission has not as yet decided to set out its intentions on future policy concerning country of origin labelling.  Ireland will contributes to any such discussions at EU level as appropriate.</p></reply>

Waiting list numbers on the scoliosis active waiting list dropped from 312 patients in February 2017 to 156 by 31 December 2017. This is as a result of the concerted efforts of staff and clinicians across the treating hospitals, HSE and Children's Hospital Group to increase activity within our children's hospitals, the Mater and Cappagh hospitals as well as of outsourcing initiatives developed by the HSE.  371 surgeries took place in 2017 across all treating hospitals both home and abroad, including two hospitals which were successful in an international tender run by the HSE for paediatric spinal fusion procedures. Of these 371 procedures, 28 were outsourced to Germany and the UK with a further 22 patients declining surgery abroad.</p>  <p>  A Paediatric Scoliosis Services Co-Design group is in place, which includes clinicians, hospital staff and representatives from the scoliosis advocacy groups, to design a comprehensive contemporary and  patient-centred approach to the delivery of scoliosis services.</p>  <p>  &euro;9 million investment funding has been allocated for 2018 to the HSE for the development of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis. The 2018 Service Plan includes a commitment from the HSE to continue to improve access to paediatric orthopaedics, including surgery for scoliosis, in conjunction with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group to achieve clinically appropriate waiting times. This will be underpinned by the development of a standardised pathway of care for children and adolescents with scoliosis which will be evidence-based and patient-centred. Further development of Scoliosis services will be guided by the recommendations emerging from the work of the Co-Design Group. The Co-Design Group is also working towards publishing agreed criteria for surgery which are based on clinical grounds and national and international best practice.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the 4-month target for accessing surgery for scoliosis will be maintained into 2018 and beyond. </p></reply>

Under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013) as amended, each resident must have a care plan prepared following a comprehensive assessment, carried out by an appropriate health care professional immediately before or on admission to a nursing home. One of the reasons for such an assessment is to establish that the nursing home will be able to meet the care needs of each individual.  The care assessment should be formally reviewed at regular intervals and, where necessary, revised. </p>  <p>  Discharges from a nursing home, including removal to another facility, must be discussed, planned for and agreed with a resident and, where appropriate, with their family or carer, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of their residency as set out in their agreed contract of care.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would suggest that the individual concerned and/or a member of their family contact the HSE directly to discuss what options may be available to them.</p></reply>

In line with the National Maternity Strategy, Government policy is to co-locate all remaining maternity hospitals with adult acute services in order to provide optimal clinical outcomes.  Co-location of maternity services with adult services provides mothers with access to a full range of medical and support services should the need arise. The availability of these services helps ensure the delivery of an optimum, safe service, particularly for high risk mothers and babies.</p><p>Following the grant of planning permission for the new National Maternity Hospital on the St Vincent's University Hospital campus, the Design Team is continuing to work on the detailed design of the hospital and the preparation of tender documents, initially for a major enabling works contract.  This development will of course represent the flagship project of the National Maternity Strategy and will constitute the largest single investment ever made in maternity services in Ireland. Work on a legal framework to protect the State's interest in the project is expected to conclude shortly.</p><p>I have been advised that the Rotunda hospital has commissioned consultants to prepare a draft Design Brief.  In addition, work is nearing completion on the preparation of a Development Control Plan for the Connolly campus and this will support the orderly development of future capital projects on that campus, including the Maternity Hospital. In relation to the redevelopment and relocation of University Maternity Hospital Limerick, I understand that a steering group for the relocation has been established, a site feasibility study has been completed and a location has been determined to accommodate the design brief for the new maternity hospital on the grounds of University Hospital Limerick at Dooradoyle.</p><p>Health capital funding was outlined in the recently published Public Service Estimates for 2018 and the HSE is currently developing its Capital Plan for 2018-2021. </p><p>The Government is preparing a new National Development Plan for the period 2018-2027, which is expected to be published alongside and in support of the forthcoming new National Planning Framework, to sustain national economic and social progress over the long term.  </p><p> As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health care projects, the Executive has been requested to reply to you in relation to expenditure incurred to date on this project.</p></reply>

Considerable progress has been made in delivering primary care centres.  There are three different methods of delivery: direct build, operational lease, and public private partnership.  The mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care centres are dependent on a number of factors.  Some of these factors are outside the control of the Health Service Executive.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered / provided / available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff. In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing. </p>  <p>  Over 106 primary care centres are already operational, of which 63 have opened since 2011.  There are 35 locations at which primary care infrastructure is under construction or at an advanced planning or design stage under the three different methods of delivery.  Of these, 14 are by the Public Private Partnership programme, 11 are by operational lease and 10 are by direct build.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017.</p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010.  The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.</p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.</p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer received this item under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.  Consequently, Budget 2018 allocated &euro;55 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2018.  This significant increase in funding more than doubles their 2017 total allocation which was &euro;20m.</p><p>The HSE and NTPF are working together to develop coherent and synergistic Waiting List Action Plans in 2018 with the objective of arranging the provision of treatment for patients across a range of inpatient/daycase and outpatient specialties and procedures.  These initiatives will continue to focus on long-waiting patients and overall waiting list numbers.</p><p>The NTPF publishes the Inpatient and Outpatient waiting list figures by specialty and hospital each month.  This information is available on NTPF.ie.  The most recent figures published by the NTPF for December 2017 indicates that there is a total of 41 people on the Inpatient/Daycase waiting list for Endocrinology and a total of 9,043 people on the Outpatient waiting list for Endocrinology.  The Deputy may wish to note that this data is extracted from the overall waiting list figures which does not differentiate transgender patients from other patients on the waiting list.</p><p>With respect to transgender persons seeking to access hormone treatment, the existing care pathway in Ireland generally begins with an approach by an individual to their GP.  The GP may refer the person to the local Community Mental Health Team for support and a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria by psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist.<b></b>A thorough assessment is a pre-requisite to commencing hormone suppressants in Ireland, in line with international best practice.  This is to ensure that the correct path is being taken for the individual and to ensure co-morbid issues are identified and addressed.</p><p>More broadly, the National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2014,</i>has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.  This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p></reply>

The Healthy Eating sub-group, which includes the stakeholder Departments involved in publishing the Nutrition Standards for Food in Schools will meet later this month to discuss Terms of Reference and propose a Work Programme. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Healthy Eating sub-group of the OPIOG will include an action to elaborate on work aimed at promoting cross-sectoral action to support healthy eating for children and  young people in various settings such as schools and colleges, the youth sector and the community. Rolling out the Nutrition Standards for School Meals to all primary and post primary schools will be discussed in this context.</p>  <p>  Guidelines for Development of a Healthy Eating Policy in Post-Primary Schools are available from my Department and used by the Healthy Eating and Active Living Programme in the HSE together with the revised Food Pyramid resources and the Nutrition Standards in School Meals with schools. This work will also be discussed in the context of the work programme agreed for the OPOIG Healthy Eating sub-group.</p>  <p>  The Lifeskills survey falls under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills, who are supportive of the promotion of healthy lifestyles in schools and has issued circulars (51/2015 and Circular 0013/2016) to support and strengthen schools' efforts in developing in young people the skills and attitudes needed to make informed decisions about their health. </p>  <p>  Much is being done already in the area of education on healthy lifestyles, both in terms of the curriculum delivery and in resourcing. The latter includes support from organisations or projects like An Bord Bia, Food Dudes, Incredible Edibles and Health Promoting Schools. Schools and the wider education sector in conjunction with parents and families have a crucial role to play in supporting students to make healthy choices. Actions to support this can be seen across the curriculum, through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education. It is also an important component of Wellbeing, the new area of learning introduced to all first year students from September 2017, as part of the implementation of the new Framework for Junior Cycle. The work in schools to support healthy lifestyles complements the Government's Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025 - Healthy Ireland.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government and Sl&aacute;intecare commit to shifting the model of healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. </p>  <p>  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. A new contract should be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce. It should also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency. This will be key in making general practice a more attractive career.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and officials from the Department of Health and the HSE meet with GP representatives on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that agreement can be reached with GP representatives in the coming months on service developments that can be introduced during 2018. </p></reply>

This would require Member States to develop a simple CAP Strategic Plan, to be approved by the Commission, which would cover both Pillar I and Pillar II interventions.</p>  <p>  As a proponent of subsidiarity, I am glad this features in the Communication in a significant way. Nonetheless reconciling this ambition with administrative simplification will not be easy.  Although the Communication proposes a simpler planning process than that currently in place for Rural Development Programmes, Member States will have to work hard together to ensure that this does not lead to further complexity, and that integrity of the single market is preserved. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing the Communication in advance of legislative provisions to be presented by the Commission in mid 2018.</p></reply>

I am advised by IFI that the report of RSM McClure clearly identified the risks relating to fleet which is mainly focused on legal compliance, value for money and being able to demonstrate visibility on fleet activities.  The Score Rating for fleet operation was defined as limited.  RSM found a significant risk that the system could fail to meet its objectives.  It was recommended that prompt action was required to improve the adequacy and/or effectiveness of governance, risk management and control.</p>  <p>I would emphasise that the primary purpose of a vehicle telematics system is to improve efficiency, productivity, vehicle utilisation, service delivery, value for money, and of paramount importance the security and health and safety of employees.  Following a competitive tender process, a company well recognised in the field, was awarded the contract to provide fleet management software and vehicle telematics to IFI. </p>  <p>  The tender was awarded on the basis of the review above identifying the need for an electronic solution to ensure legal compliance.  The successful tenderer  has over 1000 companies/organisations using this system, some of which are local authorities as well as government agencies such as the Office of Public Works, Irish Coastguard and others.  Other Public Bodies have similar systems in place.</p>  <p>  IFI operates within the assigned maximum number of employees as assigned by my Department based on sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and reform.  The filling of any post that becomes vacant is a day to day operational matter for the Board and management of IFI and is reviewed on a case by case basis, in line with the permitted number of employees and the national operational requirements of IFI.</p></reply>

There are approximately 900 EV charge points in Ireland of which circa 70 are rapid chargers.  There are charge points located at Carrickmacross, Castleblaney, Clones, Monaghan Town, Bailieborogh, Ballyjamesduff, Cavan Town and Cootehill.  A map showing all public charge points in Ireland, including the status and availability of the charge points, is available on the ESB&rsquo;s website at </font>www.esb.ie/ecars<font color="#0D0D0D">.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The maintenance of these charge points is an operational matter for the ESB and I have asked that the eCars team contact the Deputy directly in relation to the charge point in Virginia.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In March 2014, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities approved an application from ESB Networks to recover the costs of a pilot project to a maximum of &euro;25 million from use of system charges to cover the rollout of this infrastructure.  Following a public consultation process, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published its independent regulatory decision in relation to the ownership of this infrastructure in October 2017.  A key outcome of the decision is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges.  This is in keeping with the proposals set out by the European Commission in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package which was published in 2016. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Commission for Regulation of Utilities also envisages the future sale of the infrastructure by ESB Networks.  However, the continued ownership of the charging network by ESB Networks for a transitional period of up to ten years is provided for.  This ensures no short to medium term impact on the electric vehicle charging infrastructure and allows the ESB to continue to provide electric vehicle charging across Ireland.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The decision also set out the need for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis.</font>In the absence of State-led support, this is unlikely to happen in the near term.  Funding has been allocated in my Department's budget this year to support the provision of public charging, with a particular focus on increasing the number of rapid chargers on key national routes.</p><p>The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles.  A key focus of the work of the Taskforce is examining options for infrastructure, regulation and pricing in order to devise a sustainable policy framework for effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.  This includes examining options for the provision of public charging.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, including Solar Photovoltaics (Solar PV) at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.  </p>  <p>  The 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines set the framework and extent of financial support options for national renewable electricity (RES-E) support schemes. In general and except for small scale and demonstration projects, RES-E support levels must be set through competitive bidding processes (renewable electricity auctions) and all new RES-E schemes should provide support in the form of a premium in addition to the market price.  This support mechanism is very different to current schemes in place in Ireland where all renewable electricity generators within specific sectors get a fixed price for the electricity they export to the national grid. In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses have been a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.  </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the emerging principles of the proposed RESS closed on 10 November.  Over 1,250 submissions were received, which are being reviewed and will inform the final design of the RESS.  Following on from this, a final proposal will be brought to Government for approval in early 2018, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. Subsequent to a Government decision, a formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence.  </p>  <p>  At this point no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS. I welcome and have noted with interest the falling costs of some renewable technologies over the past year, most notably Solar PV and offshore wind.  Increasing renewable technology diversity is one of several policy objectives the new RESS is trying to deliver and falling technology costs may lead to increased diversity of the renewable portfolio over the medium term.  </p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that today over 67% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband and this is set to increase to 77% (1.8m premises) by the end of 2018 and to 90% (2.1m premises) by the end of 2020.  </p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018 as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April.  </p><p>According to the High Speed Broadband Map there are 2 AMBER premises in the townland of Gortahoosh which lie in the NBP State led Intervention area, 1 LIGHT BLUE premises which will receive a connection as part of eir&rsquo;s planned rural deployment and 45 BLUE premises which have already been passed as part of said deployment.  </p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention or AMBER area.  </p><p>For those in the LIGHT BLUE area, information on eir's planned rural deployment, including rollout timelines, is available at <i><i></i></i>.  </p><p>Those BLUE premises which have been passed by a eir as part of their ongoing rural deployment can visit <i><i></i></i>to see a list of the providers which are utilising the new rural deployment to deliver connectivity to high speed broadband.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-18a.677.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011800072#WRT01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 264 together.  </p>  <p>  The relevant legislation for commercial salmon fishing is the Inland Fisheries Acts 1959 To 2017 and a suite of secondary legislation enacted each year following annual review.  Management of salmon stocks is informed by scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and Ireland&rsquo;s Standing Scientific Committee.  </p>  <p>  Ireland manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis.  This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries.  This is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers, river sections, estuaries, etc., has its own genetically unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.  </p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies. In order to align fully with the Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles, the Irish Government closed mixed stock fisheries in 2007, including coastal and offshore fishing for salmon, and introduced a Hardship Scheme under which, fishermen active in the commercial salmon fishery could opt to voluntarily cease fishing and undertake not to seek a licence in the future.  In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects.  The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008.  It is considered that river stocks in Ireland would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented.  </p>  <p>  Harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus of fish over the conservation limit.  Fisheries in estuaries may also be permitted where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuaries are each meeting their individual conservation limits.  </p>  <p>  During migration from rivers to marine feeding grounds, salmon from both rivers in Ireland and rivers in other countries travel through Ireland&rsquo;s coastal waters.  These "mixed stocks" pose particular difficulties for management as they contain individual fish often from a wide range of rivers some of which are below sustainable reproductive capacity.  Any deviation from current policy would be contrary to the international independent scientific advice and would lead to indiscriminate exploitation as the &ldquo;home river&rdquo; of off-shore salmon cannot be identified and it is not possible to disaggregate the individuals or stock groups at sea.  </p>  <p>  Such a move could potentially lead to conflict with EU and international obligations on grounds of not protecting vulnerable Irish and international salmon stocks.  The conservation imperative demands that current salmon stocks are not further eroded by mismanagement or inappropriate exploitation, whether via angling, commercial fisheries in rivers inland or through the operation of mixed stock fisheries at sea or in estuaries.  </p>  <p>  Fisheries management does not provide for the concept of a heritage fishery and essentially the basis for all exploitation must responsibly concentrate on the availability of a surplus resource as the paramount criterion for licensing activity.  Consideration of heritage matters is more appropriate to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  However, the context of any discussion as regards salmon fishing must be set against the background of the State's obligations under, and adherence to, the EU Habitats Directive, other environmental legislation and international agreements.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to international agreements entered into at EU level and at NASCO and the prohibition of mixed stock fisheries is a key element of international best practice in salmon conservation and management.  </p></reply>

My position on the establishment of a Digital Safety Commissioner has been widely reported and I am currently exploring and consulting on the need, feasibility and requirements on creating this Office.  On Tuesday 21 November 2017 I convened  a meeting with my colleagues, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and their officials. I arranged this meeting to discuss online safety issues, including the various initiatives which are taking place at a national and European level to tackle illegal or harmful content online.  </p>  <p>  It is a complex area that straddles the responsibilities of many Departments.  </p>  <p>  Given the cross-cutting nature of the subject and the range of diverse activities being taken by many Government Departments, by the European Commission, by industry and by stakeholders, we agreed at this meeting to progress the matter of digital safety through an Open Policy Debate.  The Open Policy Debate will take place on Thursday 8 March in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham (IMMA).  </p>  <p>  My Department is leading the co-ordination of this open policy debate with the support and participation of the Departments of Justice &amp;amp; Equality; Education &amp;amp; Skills; Business, Enterprise and Innovation; Health, and Children and Youth Affairs.  The overall aim of the event is to raise awareness among all participants of the activities which are being undertaken by the Irish Government, by the European Commission and by industry.  The concerns and proposals from NGOs and advocacy groups and other players will be addressed at this Open Policy Debate and gaps will be identified where further action is required and areas where further cooperation between stakeholders is possible.  </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with the relevant online platforms, ISPCC, parents' groups and other key stakeholders who will be participating in the initiative to ensure the Forum is successful, informative and results driven.  </p></reply>

Following the recent mid-term review of the Capital Plan, the allocations announced in Budget 2018 allow for an enhanced four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for public transport over the period 2018-2021.  This funding will progress key capital programmes that will help address congestion and emerging capacity constraints on our public transport system across our cities and will include BusConnects GDA, Metro North and Luas, Heavy Rail and DART Expansion, Maintenance of the existing Rail Network, Cycling &amp;amp; Walking, Sustainable Urban Transport as well as allocations for Carbon Reduction measures, accessibility retro-fit and ticketing system upgrades. </p><p>In response to the specific questions raised by the Deputy I wish to advise the following:</p><p>The Phoenix Park Tunnel Link project is now complete and opened for passenger services in November 2016. I am advised that the total capital cost of the project was &euro;13.5 million.</p><p>In relation to the Smarter Travel Policy 2009-2020, allocations were made to fund an overall SmarterTravel &amp;amp; Sustainable Transport Measures programme in the GDA and Regional Cities. This has funded the Regional Cities Programme, the Sustainable Transport Measures Grant (STMG) Programme, and a range of <i>Smarter Travel</i>initiatives (including the Smarter Travel Areas Programme, Active Travel Towns, National Cycle Network, development of greenways and other measures to support sustainable transport and travel such as mobility management initiatives and Bike Week).  &euro;46 million and &euro;42 million were drawndown in 2016 and 2017.  An allocation of &euro;251 million has been earmarked to support Sustainable Urban Transport and specific urban Cycling and Walking investment over the period 2018-2021.</p><p>In relation to safety and efficiency maintenance of the rail network, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the heavy rail network. In accordance with the requirements of EU law, my Department provides annual capital funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the maintenance and renewal of the network under the <i>Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract </i>(IMMAC).  &euro;134 million and &euro;158.77 million was allocated to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for 2016, 2017, with &euro;160m allocated for 2018.  </p><p>In relation to Metro North, funding of over &euro;700 million has been allocated under the Government&rsquo;s present Capital Plan 2016-2021 for planning, design and construction of new Metro North with construction work commencing in 2021 and passenger services starting in 2027. The estimated cost of completing the new Metro North project is &euro;2.4 billion. The NTA, in collaboration with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), is undertaking an option analysis and selection study of possible metro alignments and station locations.  Arising from this work a final route and station location will be established. It is my understanding that the NTA and TII expect that this process will be completed shortly, after which a public consultation process will be undertaken on the Emerging Preferred Route (EPR). It is also expected that Preliminary Design will commence early this year.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy's questions on bus fleet and bus corridors the recently announced 4 Year Capital Plan provides for investment of over &euro;770 million to progress the BusConnects programme.  It was launched last summer by the NTA and work is ongoing on the redesign of the bus services network and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme. When this work is completed the proposals will be launched for public consultation in the first half of this year. The results of the public consultation will inform the final decisions to be made on the network redesign, Core Bus Corridors and park and ride facilities.  In particular, BusConnects will help address growing congestion in the Dublin region in the short to medium term.  In addition to providing the obvious considerable improvement in bus infrastructure, the investment will also provide much improved cycling and walking facilities along the key corridors.</p><p>In relation to the remaining questions raised by the Deputy, funding of &euro;230 million over the period 2018-2021 is allocated for mainline rail projects (including City Centre Resignalling and the National Train Control Centre) and DART capacity enhancement that will allow acceleration of the initial stages of the overall DART Expansion Programme, focussing particularly at this stage on providing additional fleet to enhance capacity, and extending the electrified DART system. Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on electrification of the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan - now expected to be delivered in 2022 - and commencing work on the Maynooth line.  The remaining elements of the DART Expansion programme are being considered in the context of the 10 year investment plan that is expected to be published in the near future.</p><p>Noting the responsibilities of the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s questions on DART Expansion, City Centre Re-signalling and the National Train Control Centre to both organisations for further information in relation to expenditure on the specific projects referred to by the Deputy.  I have also forwarded the Deputy's questions on expenditure to date on the Metro North project and expenditure on buses to the NTA for direct reply.</p><p>Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

The proportion of freight in Ireland moved by rail is low at present, at a little over 1% of total domestic freight tonnage. However, there has been some growth in recent years with a 6% increase of rail freight tonne-kms between 2012 and 2014. Irish Rail has estimated that rail&rsquo;s share of the freight market could grow organically to 5%, while with significant investment a target of 10% of all freight could be reached.</p>  <p>  I understand that rail freight revenue increased in 2016, with total tonne kilometres increasing from 96.4 million to 101.4 million.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann continues to progress work building on recent trials in longer freight trains in 2016 which aims to strengthen the commercial competitiveness of rail freight. I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has also engaged with a number of parties regarding substantial rail freight opportunities within the Bio Mass market focussing on the commercial, environmental and wider economic value that rail freight offers within these markets.</p>  <p>  The key priorities for investment in the rail network are largely framed by the recommendations of my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport which was published in 2015. This informed the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan setting out the need to protect investments made to date and to maintain safety standards in the rail network. Prioritisation of this category of investment is also a key finding of a recent Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland conducted by the International Monetary Fund.  My officials continue to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that these recommendations underpin the ten year capital investment plan which I understand will be published shortly.  Finally in context of national and EU objectives to shift to lower-emission modes of transport, growth in the role of rail freight is desirable and my Department will continue to examine how such growth may be promoted.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  Implementation of the regional and local road improvement projects included in the capital plan is, therefore, the responsibility of the relevant local authority.   </p>  <p>  The eight regional and local road improvement projects mentioned by the Deputy are included in the capital plan.  As it will be some years before funding under the capital plan builds up to the level required to maintain the regional and local road network in a steady state condition, expenditure continues to be primarily directed towards maintenance and renewal work.  This means that the capital plan upgrade projects have to be implemented on  a phased basis as budgets allow and as projects are advanced through the project development stages by the relevant local authorities.  Overall over &euro;140 million of capital plan funding has been earmarked for implementation of these projects, the construction of which is subject to a competitive tender process. </p>  <p>  Two of the projects have reached construction stage - the Sallins Bypass and the upgrade of the Nangor and Adamstown roads in the vicinity of Grange Castle business park.  The main design and construction elements of the Naas bypass widening scheme, Osberstown Interchange and Sallins Bypass Schemes are being progressed under one construction contract.  Kildare County Council is the contracting authority and these three projects are expected to be completed on a phased basis over 2019 and 2020.  In the case of the Nangor and Adamstown road upgrade, South Dublin County Council is the contracting authority and it is anticipated that the project will be completed in 2019. </p>  <p>  The other projects will be progressed as the necessary development consents, land acquisition and procurement are advanced and as funding can be made available by my Department.  I can assure the Deputy  that my Department is committed to these projects and will be making funding available over the capital plan period to meet the State's commitments in relation to these schemes.  </p>  <p>  As regards grant expenditure to date for these projects, this information is included in the regional and local roads payment and allocations booklets which are available in the Oireachtas library.</p></reply>

A key provision in the Bill provides that an adopted person aged 18 years or over who was adopted prior to commencement of the Bill will be provided with the information required to apply for his or her birth certificate, subject to certain conditions.  The Bill also provides for access to relevant records containing the information concerned that are held by the Authority.

Projects totalling some &euro;21m were announced in October last year and accordingly accelerated drawdown is anticipated this year under the scheme.</p>  <p>  In the case of LEADER, and in line with LEADER programmes in other EU Member States, there has been a lead-in period last year in ramping up and implementing the 2014-2020 programme.

The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 set out further requirements that owners of specific breeds of dogs have to follow, namely that such dogs must be muzzled and led, on a sufficiently strong leash or chain not exceeding 2 metres in length, by a competent person over 16 years of age when in a public place.  </p>  <p>  These specific control requirements for restricted breeds provide a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners, respects animal welfare to the extent possible, while also taking account of the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury, or cause death.  </p>  <p>  However, I am aware that representations have been made expressing concerns regarding the overall approach to the regulation of restricted breeds. There is also the view that further breeds may warrant inclusion on the list of restricted breeds.

Funding is available under the scheme towards the purchase by a registered community-based organisation of equipment i.e. a personal alarm and/or pendant, which is provided to the elderly person participating.  The scheme is operated on my Department's behalf by Pobal.</p>  <p>  Following a review, a new version of the scheme was launched on 1st November 2017.  A number of important new changes were introduced, including an extension of the eligibility criteria to include elderly people who live on their own for long periods during the day and the introduction of free monitoring for the first year, following which a small charge will apply.  In tandem with the new scheme, a nationwide public awareness campaign is being rolled out, in partnership with Pobal, to increase a greater level of awareness, interest and participation in the scheme. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to report a very high uptake of the new scheme which I have facilitated through the provision of additional funding. By end December 2017, over 21,000 applications have been approved and some 18,000 installations were made.  My Department will continue to review the operation of the scheme, and will continue to encourage elderly people to participate in this scheme.</p></reply>

All jobseekers over one year on the Live Register are eligible for selection for the JobPath service and clients are chosen by means of a random selection process.</p>  <p>  Customers referred to JobPath who are also working part-time will have all activities including meetings with their personal advisor scheduled around their work commitments and the JobPath contractors are required to be flexible in the provision of the service in that respect.  </p>  <p>  The person in question was working part-time when referred to the JobPath service in December 2017.  He attended a Joint Information Session in January 2018 where he was assigned a Personal Advisor and agreed a Personal Progression Plan.  He was advised that his appointments would be scheduled for days on which he was not working and should he be contacted to work at short notice he should inform Turas Nua immediately and his appointments would be re-scheduled.  Turas Nua have accommodated this client and re-scheduled his appointments on a number of occasions so far.</p>  <p>  JobPath provides an intensive personal service which focuses on the skills and experience of each person.  As this client is already in part-time employment the focus may be on options or opportunities to increase the level of employment in his current role, or look at possibilities in other areas, which may also involve some training, but could provide a more sustainable income and a move away from jobseekers payments.  Therefore, it is important that he continues to attend all his meetings. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Each scheme area is continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to as quickly as possible, and their claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  </p><p>The Table provides details (where available) of processing times for each of the Department&rsquo;s schemes in December 2017.  All claims are registered promptly: in some schemes this is done through the scanning of claim documents onto the system while in other schemes this involves an officer inputting data.  The time taken to perform means tests and/or medical examinations where these are required is not measured separately, while a determination on habitual residence where required is an integral part of the decision making process.</p><p>Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  As can be seen from the data in the table, schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise where information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.</p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised. </p><p>In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  </p><p>The Intreo service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalized service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo Centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into the Department.  The benefits of the integrated decisions process are readily visible in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.  </p><p>Average time to Award for principle DEASP schemes,  December 2017<table><tr><th>Schemes</th><th>Average time to award (weeks)</th></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>One-Parent Family Payment</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Contributory (Dom)</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Widow, Widower&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partners Contributory Pension </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Widowed Parent Grant</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Non-Contributory</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Household Benefits</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Free Travel</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (Domestic &amp;amp; FRA)</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (Over 16)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (Additional Child)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Benefit</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>7</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The 2016 results provide a breakdown by each local authority across a range of categories.</p><p>Full details in relation to the 2016 assessment are available on my Department's website, at the following link: </p><p>Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Accordingly, the day-to-day operation of the social housing system is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>My Department has not carried out an analysis of the type set out by the Deputy. However, an increased national social housing target of 50,000 homes has been set under Rebuilding Ireland and I will be discussing this heightened target at a Housing Summit I am holding with the local authority Chief Executives next week.  I recently wrote to each local authority setting out their respective social housing delivery targets out to 2021.  These targets are based on their housing need, as identified through the 2017 assessment, which I expect to be published shortly.  This is the fairest and most objective basis for target setting. </p><p>The delivery targets I have set for local authorities out to 2021 are based on current housing need.  It is acknowledged that future annualised assessments may see individual local authorities housing need numbers rising, or falling, for a variety of reasons.  The targets have been set in such a way as to be able to respond to such an eventuality over the course of the period covered by Rebuilding Ireland.  Within the suite of social housing solutions is the Mortgage to Rent Scheme, which is specifically targeted at households in unsustainable mortgage situations, and which can be deployed by local authorities as a response to potential repossession situations, where appropriate.</p></reply>

It is to deliver 1,500 social housing units in total, via three bundles.  The first bundle, which comprises six PPP sites, is to provide over 500 units in the Greater Dublin Area.  Two of the sites are located in the Dublin City Council area with one each in the County Council areas of South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth.</p>  <p>  The second bundle, comprising eight PPP sites which are to provide over 450 units, was announced in June 2016.  Three of the sites are located in the Cork County Council area, with one each in  the Galway City Council and Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council areas.  There is a further one site in each of the County Council areas of Clare, Kildare and Roscommon.</p>  <p>  The identification and selection of sites for the third project bundle is currently underway and is expected to be finalised in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Each individual bundle of sites takes an estimated 37-48 months to deliver in total, including planning, procurement and construction.  It is expected that construction will commence in 2018 on the first bundle of sites, with units becoming available from 2019.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  </p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  Following a tendering process, my Department appointed SEA consultants in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report, will be undertaken during the first quarter of this year, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines - following detailed analysis and consideration of all of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase - during Q3 2018.  </p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board) must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force and continue to apply to existing planning applications which are with either the local planning authorities or the Board for determination.</p></reply>

These changes will strengthen the impact of the Rent Predictability Measure and will further slow the growth in rents.  These enhanced enforcement procedures to be introduced in 2018 will reform the Rent Pressure Zone Mechanism to deliver a more effective and transparent approach to its operation.</p></reply>
