    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-28a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800057#WRA00800"><p>The Action Plan on School Age Childcare, a cross-Department report, was launched at the meeting of the Early Years Forum on Monday 6 March.  The Action Plan was heavily informed by consultations with various groups over 2015 and 2016, and contains information related to school age childcare provision in Ireland and international best practice.  The Action Plan sets out the actions that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills can immediately progress to address the needs identified.  Progress on the Action Plan will be monitored and independently reviewed after three years.  The Plan highlights that the essential components of a child centred and effective model of school age childcare are access, affordability, and quality.</p>  <p>  Most of the actions committed to in the plan do not require additional funding at this point in time but will be delivered with existing resources.  For example, an immediate priority is the development of a comprehensive set of quality standards to specifically address the needs of school age children.  A robust system of quality assurance against the standards will also be designed and will be a requirement to be eligible for any State funding.  The Learner Fund my Department operates will be redesigned to include dedicated funding each year for education on school age childcare.  The Department of Education and Skills will use its existing resource to develop guidelines for schools interested in providing school age childcare services. </p>  <p>  &euro;3 million has been provided in 2017 for major and minor capital grants to ensure sufficient access to high quality and affordable school age childcare.  The new capital scheme will be open to both community/not-for-profit and private services and will comprise three separate strands.  The first strand, for the establishment of new School Age Childcare services, will see a grant of up to &euro;20,000 being made available.  The second strand will see a grant of up to &euro;10,000 being made available for the expansion of existing services to provide additional places.  The third strand will see a grant of up to &euro;5,000 being made available to existing services to improve quality. </p>  <p>  My Department has a budget of over &euro;460m per annum to address both the affordability and quality of early years and school age childcare.  Approximately 110,000 children benefit annually from the free pre-school scheme.  Another 31,000 children benefited from subsidised early years and school age childcare in 2015/2016 with a budget available of approximately &euro;86m. </p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme which I plan to introduce on a phased basis from September is a key part of the School Age Childcare Action Plan.  It will provide a critical infrastructure for the provision of subsidised childcare to a much wider population, by suitably quality assured services.  The scheme will enable Government to make additional investment available, year on year I hope, to reduce the cost of childcare, ideally to reach a stage where Ireland compares favourably with its OECD counterparts.  The annual Estimates process will provide the mechanism for Government to consider the level of further investment possible for childcare.</p></reply>

Like many of the Deputies in this house I have met and engaged with them.  Indeed one of the most memorable days of my time as Minister was at the site in Tuam before the Commission began its work.  There I met with survivors and Catherine Corless, who had recollections of the home.</p>  <p>  Some of those I met at the site are trying to find out what happened to loved ones who were resident there.  They want answers, they want the truth - and that is completely understandable.  As Deputies will understand it was an emotional day for all &ndash; as by coincidence later in the afternoon the Mother and Baby Home Commission confirmed it was going ahead with an investigation of the site.  In that regard I can also understand the impatience for the publication of the Second Interim Report - indeed I share that impatience.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware from previous PQs that it has been necessary for me to engage with Cabinet colleagues on issues in the report which extend beyond my own remit as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I again briefed Cabinet on the matter this morning and underlined the need for us to move swiftly to a conclusion.  Within the coming week the Government will be ready to clarify completion of this process.  Let me assure the House now that officials within my Department will ensure that survivor and other representative groups are advised of developments prior to any public announcements.</p>  <p>  Deputies are also asking about the terms of reference of the Mother and Baby Home Commission.  I am of course aware that there have been many calls for an extension of the terms.  I am  committed to a scoping exercise to examine that possibility.  It will examine whether broader terms of reference will help answer the questions of survivors, loved ones or indeed those questions we must face as a nation.  As Minister I need to consult with the Commission on this matter.  I will do so and make further announcements in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me however not to remind deputies that we must not lose sight of the breadth and considerable scope of the Commissions existing terms of reference.  The Commission does have significant autonomy to follow where the investigation takes it and can make any recommendations it deems necessary to Government.</p>  <p>  Deputies we are examining a dark period in our history - for too long only whispered about, that&rsquo;s if it was acknowledged at all.  The work and investigations being carried out are bringing a spotlight to these events.  It is and will continue to be emotional for all involved - it is and will continue to be uncomfortable for our country.  However it is work which must be done.  The Commission is two years into a three year work programme.  We must not say anything or take actions which will threaten to undermine that work.  Can I acknowledge the political unity which exists to achieve that truth.</p></reply>

This will bring the total youth funding by my Department to &euro;57.4m, an increase of 10% over last year's allocation.  Following the cuts during the economic crises, I have now restored youth funding to 95% of its 2011 figure, and I hope to be able to make more progress next year.</p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff  working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  My Department, along with all government departments, was required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012 &ndash; 2014.  My Department sought to ensure that front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, were protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased that my Department is now in a position to provide further investment in youth service provision which is close to restoring the funding levels that existed prior to 2011.  My Department has carried out a Value for Money and Policy Review of a number of schemes supporting youth services.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives and made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  I want to streamline the various funding schemes for youth services so that we maximise their benefit and target money to best effect.  I have prioritised the work on developing a new integrated funding scheme as recommended by the Value for Money and Policy Review.  Consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing this new and fit for purpose youth funding programme as soon as possible.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I am committed to continuing to seek additional support for youth services in Budget 2018 and beyond.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-28a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800057#WRA01900"><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department will provide an allocation to Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board for the provision of a full time youth officer for County Kildare in 2017.  My Department is engaging with the ETB in this regard and I expect that the post will be filled shortly.  In the interim, the ETB has a Youth Officer in place who is very active in both counties.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the provision of the full-time officer follows my engagement with public representatives, youth organisations, the Garda&iacute; and others in Co Kildare.  Indeed the Deputy himself as well as Deputy O&rsquo;Loughlin joined me on 22 June last when I opened the Hive Youth Caf&eacute; in Kildare Town.  It was an evening of celebration.  During the visit I also took time to sit down with youth and community representatives to discuss the needs of a county which has one of the youngest populations.  It was a productive discussion and I came away very impressed with the partnership which has formed in Kildare to deliver for young people.</p>  <p>  It was agreed then that we would continue further engagement and on 16 November I met members of the Kildare Children and Young People's Services Committee and the Kildare Local Community Development Committee here in Leinster House.  The urgent need for the provision of the full time post was highlighted during that discussion.  I can now confirm that following that meeting and contacts with the Deputy and other public representatives that we are now in a position to move forward.</p>  <p>  My Department has has been working with a number of ETBs which have not had a full Youth Officer function in place.  With this in mind, I have increased the overall allocation for this purpose nationally, from &euro;1.743m in 2016 to &euro;2m this year.</p>  <p>  The increased allocation is illustrative of my commitment to youth services, and I wish Kildare and Wicklow ETB well as it moves to fill this valuable post.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-28a.22.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800057#WRA02100"><p><i>33.</i> To ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs if she will address the anomaly created under the affordable child care scheme whereby the places of children who are currently availing of essential early intervention supports under CCS and whose parents will not meet the eligibility criteria for ACS will no longer be funded; the way the early intervention needs of this group of children will be met post-ACS introduction; and if she will make a statement on the matter. <b>[15204/17]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-28a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800057#WRA02200"><p>The Affordable Childcare Scheme will provide progressive financial support for childcare costs, with the largest subsidies going to the families with the lowest incomes.  Where a family has childcare needs and has a net family income below &euro;47,500, they will be eligible for an income-related subsidy under the scheme.  The highest rates of subsidy will apply to families with net incomes below &euro;22,700, which includes all families whose incomes are below the relative income poverty line.  Approximately 99% of current beneficiaries of targeted childcare schemes will be eligible for a subsidy under the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that in any situation where a current beneficiary of the Community Childcare Subvention or any other targeted childcare scheme would see their level of subsidy fall when the Affordable Childcare Scheme is introduced, their current level of support will be maintained for a transitional period.</p>  <p>  One change from the current targeted schemes is that, under the Affordable Childcare Scheme, if a parent is not engaged in any form of work, education or training, then at most 15 hours of subsidy will be available.  If the parent takes up any form of work (including part-time work) or training, they will be eligible for up to 40 hours of subsidy.  This approach reflects the fact that one of the core objectives of the Affordable Childcare Scheme is to support labour market activation.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will be a significant support helping families get out of poverty through work, education and training. </p>  <p>  When a parent is not in work or training, childcare will be subsidised on a standard hours basis.  This approach will mean that this scheme is open - albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours - to parents who stay at home to care for their children, and are not taking part in work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week.  In the case of school-going children, the child development objectives are met through school-going hours and, as such, the 15 standard hours childcare applies to non-term time.</p>  <p>  There is also a small but important group of families for whom childcare is needed on child welfare grounds or for whom childcare is a necessary early intervention support, and where there is a referral to the Community Childcare Subvention scheme by Tusla.  For the Affordable Childcare Scheme, it is proposed that, where such a referral is made, families would automatically qualify for a subsidy without having to satisfy any income or work/study test.  Tusla would recommend the hours of childcare needed, i.e. whether an enhanced or standard subsidy is required.  The scheme would then provide the maximum rate of subsidy in respect of those hours of care, and no payment would be asked of the parents in these circumstances.  This approach is consistent with current practice under CCS and is critical to supporting strong child welfare and protection practices.  My officials are currently in discussion with Tusla in relation to the way in which this referral process will operate in the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p></reply>

I secured additional funding for this purpose in 2017, and Tusla is now in the second year of a 3-year plan to ensure the allocation of a social worker to all children and young people who need one.</p><p>The number of children with an allocated social worker at the end of 2016 was 19,621.  At the end of 2016, the number of children awaiting allocation to a social worker was 5,413, which represents a reduction of 19% (1,305) from the figure of 6,718 at the end of  2015.  </p><p>Of the 5,413 children awaiting allocation to a social worker at the end of 2016, their priority levels are as follows:<table><tr><th>Level of Priority</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Low Priority</td><td>1,350</td></tr><tr><td>Medium Priority</td><td>3,262</td></tr><tr><td>High Priority</td><td>801</td></tr></table></p><p>Information on the length of time a child has been awaiting allocation to a social worker is available in respect of the high priority cases.  Of the 801 high priority cases awaiting allocation, 307 are waiting less than a month, 210 are waiting one to three months and 284 are waiting in excess of three months.  </p><p>Cases to be allocated to a social worker include children who have already received services from Tusla whose social worker is no longer available to them, as well as children waiting to be allocated for the first time.  All unallocated cases are assessed and prioritised according to risk.  The Deputy should note that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  Urgent and emergency cases could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill health and the need to find an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party. </p><p>It is a continuing priority of Tusla to address the problem of unallocated cases in 2017.  A key challenge to achieve this objective will be the recruitment of sufficient social workers, and other professional and supporting staff.  Tusla is engaged in a major recruitment drive for social workers, social care workers and business support staff for this purpose. </p><p>My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard.

In its recent appearance before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, the ISPCC outlined and discussed with the Committee a number of concerns about online habits and how young people interact with each other using modern technologies. </p><p>My Department does not have a lead responsibility in this area and, accordingly, does not have specific measures to combat these issues.  However, my Department plays a supporting role in a wider range of actions across a number of Departments seeking to address online abuse. </p><p>The implementation of the Children First Act 2015 and the ongoing role of the Interdepartmental Committee established by that Act, and chaired by my Department, will ensure that the child welfare and protection systems will be robust and responsive to any needs arising from such abuses. </p><p>The National Youth Health Programme is a partnership between the HSE, the National Youth Council of Ireland and my Department.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service, to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  The &lsquo;Web Safety in Youth Work&rsquo; resource, available on the National Youth Council&rsquo;s website, provides valuable advice to young people on reporting online behaviour and on passing on concerns about the protection and welfare of a child or young person.</p><p>Combatting online child grooming is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, and is addressed as part of a wide-ranging package of measures aimed at the reform of Ireland&rsquo;s criminal law on sexual offences, set out in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 2017.</p><p>The <i>saferinternetireland.ie</i>website has a range of resources aimed at parents and their children, including a recent &lsquo;Family e-Safety Kit&rsquo; activity pack aimed at six to twelve-year-olds.  The ISPCC has developed guidelines and supports for parents.  Education is a fundamental issue for parents and young people along with parental guidance, supervision, and the setting of boundaries considered critical to ensuring children&rsquo;s safety online.</p><p>The Office for Internet Safety, an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality, was established by the Government to take a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  That Office has previously published guidance related to cyber bullying and filtering technologies for parents.  As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day and supports the &lsquo;<i>Hotline.ie</i>&rsquo; service.  In addition, there are a number of other websites, such as Childline and Webwise, which have the capacity to facilitate anyone to report suspicious behaviour encountered online. </p><p>In seeking to address the problem of bullying we must tackle the root causes of bullying.  This includes a focus on tackling prejudice, including homophobia, where it exists in our schools and wider society.  The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, provides the framework for the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children from bullying and the often devastating consequences that it can have.</p><p>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment continues to promote best practice by social media providers, with respect to privacy controls and reporting mechanisms for abuse/bullying so as to better protect children online.  That Department has continued to engage with Internet service providers, including social media providers, to promote continued evolution of terms of service and guidelines.  These measures address actions identified under the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.</i></p></reply>

It is important we recognise the significant challenges facing this indigenous Community and the significant disadvantages experienced by Traveller children with poorer outcomes in education, employment, accommodation and health. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its Concluding Observations following its examination of Ireland in January 2016, recommended that &ldquo;Ireland considers legally recognising the Traveller and Roma as ethnic groups in the State party and, in doing so, implement disaggregated data collection on these communities to facilitate the provision of targeted support programmes and measures&rdquo;</p><p>My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, has primary responsibility for Traveller and Roma policy.

The State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children Report (2016), includes a specific section on the population of children in the Traveller Community; along with a number of findings related to Traveller children, in areas including nutrition; self-esteem; drug and alcohol use; family relationships; and feelings of safeness within the community.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>The <i>National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making</i>(2015-2020) contains specific actions to strengthen participation in decision-making by Traveller children and young people.</p><p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a statutory responsibility to ensure each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  Tusla's education welfare service, comprising the statutory Education Welfare Service, the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison scheme, are key supports for children who are vulnerable to early school-leaving and educational disadvantage, including Traveller children. </p><p>Children and families from the Traveller Community who require additional support or are  identified as vulnerable, also avail of other mainstream services within Tusla.  Tusla works in partnership with local authorities, the Health Service Executive and schools to ensure an integrated response to the needs of children and families from the Traveller community, including public health nursing, disability services, and other relevant services.  Tusla is operating and supporting a number of integrated and inclusive Traveller specific projects, and provides counselling grants to organisations serving the Traveller community.</p><p>My Department also provides annual funding to support specific projects which  are targeted at young Travellers; and offer a wide range of programmes and services aimed at young people at risk and who are disadvantaged, due to a combination of factors such as social isolation, substance misuse; involvement in crime; homelessness; early school-leaving and unemployment.</p></reply>

Its remit was to inquire into the abuse of children in institutions in the period 1940 to 1999.  Its terms of reference were broad and the institutions covered included schools, industrial schools, reformatory schools, orphanages, hospitals, children&rsquo;s home and any other place where children are cared for other than as members of their families.</p>  <p>  Former residents of all such institutions were invited to engage with that Inquiry, as its terms of reference included all care settings outside of the family home.  As was noted in that Commission&rsquo;s final reports, investigations were conducted into all institutions where the number of complainants was more than 20.  Where the number of complaints was less than 20 the Investigation Committee&rsquo;s legal team interviewed the witnesses.</p>  <p>  I understand that the institution to which the Deputy refers was within the scope of the Inquiry and that it was subsequently included in the list of institutions covered under the Residential institutions Redress Act, 2002.  This scheme provided for the payment of fair and just rewards to persons who were victims of institutional abuse as children.</p>  <p>  In these circumstances, I have no plans to commission any further investigation into this former residential home for children. </p></reply>

This requirement came into effect for newly-registering services on 30th June 2016 and for existing services on 31 December 2016. </p>  <p>  The requirement that staff looking after young children have a qualification has been extensively welcomed as an important quality measure.  In preparation for the implementation of the Regulations, Childcare Committees Ireland were commissioned by my Department to investigate the impact of the new childcare regulations on community childcare providers.  All community services were afforded the opportunity to engage with the project.</p>  <p>  The project indicated that the vast majority of services would not face financial hardship as a result of changes required under the regulations.  However it did find that some services had come to rely on Community Employment scheme participants as part of core staff ratios.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the regulatory change does not impact on service delivery or the availability of childcare places, I recently announced that &euro;1m of additional funding will be made available to childcare providers who have been facilitating the training of Community Employment (CE) scheme participants.</p>  <p>  I have made up to &euro;2,000 available for services initially, to assist with the recruitment process or to provide expert support in HR management.  After analysis of each service's financial situation, I will consider provision of limited funding to each service using the balance of the &euro;1 million in sustainability funding I negotiated in Budget 2017 to ensure that they can fully meet the cost of these staff.  No service will be forced to close.</p>  <p>  Delivering high quality, accessible and affordable childcare is my key goal.  I want to ensure that every child will be cared for by a qualified professional, and that services can sustain existing levels of provision, while they prepare for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This new scheme will be critical in providing an infrastructure for further investment in childcare.  It will make childcare more affordable and will also assist with improving quality and sustainability.</p></reply>

In 2016, approximately &euro;17m has been allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  In 2015, 7282 children were admitted to the Garda Diversion Programmes.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.</p><p>Under Section 88 of the Children Act 2001, a court may remand a child in custody who is charged with or found guilty of an offence, who is being sent forward for trial, or in respect of whom the court has postponed a decision.  The discretion as to whether or not to remand a child in custody is solely for the decision of the judge hearing the case.</p><p>As part of the <i>Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018</i>, a key commitment was the development of a Bail Supervision Scheme.  The scheme, which is currently operating on a pilot basis, provides more therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  The scheme provides a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies: Probation Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The scheme offers greater options to the courts in the knowledge that closer monitoring will take place through interaction with the young people, their families and communities.</p><p>It should be noted that today (24/03/2017) there are currently 34 children detained in Oberstown Children Detention Campus (Oberstown), 9 of which are on remand, which represents 26% of the total number of children detained in Oberstown.</p><p>The Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service which is a national service provided by Tusla - the Child and Family Agency and which provides clinical services to children in the community, children in detention and also in special care facilities.  On admission to Oberstown an individual management plan is put in place for each child which includes a mental health assessment to determine the need for more specialist support provided by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service and short term interventions may continue when the child returns to the community.</p></reply>

There are currently no plans to change this.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy will be aware, plans are currently in place to provide for a new national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of their childcare entitled the Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing targeted childcare subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme. </p>  <p>  The new scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.  In the case of targeted subsidies, these will be payable for children from 6 months of age up to 15 years of age.

This requirement came into effect for newly-registering services on 30th June 2016 and for existing services on 31 December 2016. </p>  <p>  The requirement that staff looking after young children have a qualification has been extensively welcomed as an important quality measure.  In preparation for the implementation of the Regulations, Childcare Committees Ireland were commissioned by my Department to investigate the impact of the new childcare regulations on community childcare providers.  All community services were afforded the opportunity to engage with the project.</p>  <p>  The project indicated that the vast majority of services would not face financial hardship as a result of changes required under the regulations.  However it did find that some services had come to rely on Community Employment scheme participants as part of core staff ratios.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the regulatory change does not impact on service delivery or the availability of childcare places, I recently announced that &euro;1m of additional funding will be made available to childcare providers who have been facilitating the training of Community Employment (CE) scheme participants.</p>  <p>  I have made up to &euro;2,000 available for services initially, to assist with the recruitment process or to provide expert support in HR management.  After analysis of each service's financial situation, I will consider provision of limited funding to each service using the balance of the &euro;1 million in sustainability funding I negotiated in Budget 2017 to ensure that they can fully meet the cost of these staff.  No service will be forced to close.</p>  <p>  Delivering high quality, accessible and affordable childcare is my key goal.  I want to ensure that every child will be cared for by a qualified professional, and that services can sustain existing levels of provision, while they prepare for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This new scheme will be critical in providing an infrastructure for further investment in childcare.  It will make childcare more affordable and will also assist with improving quality and sustainability. </p></reply>

This is being addressed through the Area-Based Childhood programme, the development of a Quality and Capacity Building initiative, and supporting relevant priorities of other Government Departments.  As part of this, the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,</i>which brings together members of the community and voluntary sector as well as independent experts, has worked on a number of priority areas including homelessness and child poverty.  Members of the Council and officials from my Department recently met with representatives from Focus Ireland and St. Vincent de Paul to progress these issues.</p><p>My Department funds the County and City Childcare Committees; and Childcare Committees Ireland, to provide business support to services.  Funding is also provided to Better Start, to provide a quality support service and to Pobal who undertake compliance visits on behalf of this Department, and the Department of Education and Skills who provide education focused support to childcare providers.</p><p>My Department also administers a range of funding schemes and targeted programmes that support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drug and alcohol misuse; early school leaving; homelessness; or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  Overall, the funding schemes support national and local youth work provision and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff and 40,000 volunteers, working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2017, funding of &euro;57.4m has been provided by my Department for various youth schemes, an increase of &euro;5.5m on 2016.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people, and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, a number of funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department, and consultations with youth services are continuing, with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review.</p><p>My Department has embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal, and each Education and Training Board (ETB) Youth Officer, which will map youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist my Department and the relevant ETB's in developing a detailed socio-demographic profile, in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  It is my intention that this mapping exercise will inform future development and investment in youth services. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department provides funding for the Child and Family Agency, Tusla.  In 2017, Tusla has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;713 million, representing an increase of &euro;37 million on 2016.  Tusla provides a comprehensive range of services and supports for vulnerable children and families.  These include: Child Welfare and Protection Services, including family support services; Educational Welfare Services; Pre-school Inspection services and Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence services.</p><p>My Department is currently working on legislation to reform the Guardian ad litem service.  Guardians ad litem perform a very important function in child care proceedings.  They are an invaluable source of advice to the Courts and a great support for the children and young people who are involved in these proceedings.  The reform proposals will address significant inadequacies in the existing arrangements and will replace the existing ad hoc system with a high quality, child-centred, cost effective national service.  Most importantly, it will extend the Guardian ad litem system to benefit the greatest number of children and young people.</p></reply>

It was designed as a time bound co-funding arrangement in conjunction with The Atlantic Philanthropies, with resources of &euro;29.7m from 2013 to 2017.  The aim of the ABC Programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  All sites are currently in contract for 2017 and operating according to their agreed budgets for 2017.  Due to contractual arrangements, each of the existing 13 sites is scheduled to come to the end of their contracts at various points throughout 2017. </p>  <p>  My department secured an additional &euro;4.5million in Budget 2016 to extend all of the existing ABC Programmes to the end of December 2017, bringing the total investment to &euro;34.2 million.  This recognises that sites being granted an extension to their original contract may require additional funding. </p>  <p>  To ascertain the level of funding that may be required by each site in this regard, my Department requested that the ABC Programme Managers provide the Department with revised financial projections and information on the cyclical nature (including costs) of the various interventions/programmes implemented by each Area.</p>  <p>  ABC sites offer several programmes that run along academic year calendars.  Bearing this in mind, my Department is putting in place arrangements to support sites to offer programmes to end August 2018 and it is the intention to seek further funding in the 2017 estimates process to facilitate this.  A communication was sent at the beginning of March to the ABC site managers, outlining these arrangements.</p>  <p>  This extension brings the existing programme closer in line with the expected timeline for delivery of the national evaluation report in 2018.  We will utilise the learning from the programme and the findings from the national evaluation to inform the design of prevention and early intervention initiatives that comprehend the Programme for Government commitments.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the continued engagement of all ABC sites with my department in 2017 as we work towards the implementation of quality prevention and early intervention initiatives in order to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families throughout Ireland.</p></reply>

It is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker, their needs are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker. </p>  <p>  The additional funding of  &euro;37 million which has been secured for Tusla in 2017 will provide increased resources to meet service demands which will include the recruitment of additional social workers.</p>  <p>  Tusla is currently developing a new Strategy for children in care, including foster care - which will include areas of reform. </p>  <p>  It is vital that all children in care, and their carers, receive adequate support to ensure a successful placement.  Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection, and is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parent(s)/guardian(s).  At the end of December 2016, there were 6,258 children in care in Ireland.  93% (5,817) of these children were cared for in foster placements.  The majority of children are in the care of general foster carers.  At the end of December 2016, 66% (4,102) of children in care were in a general foster care placement, and 27% (1,715) were in foster care with relatives.  </p>  <p>  A key support to be provided to children in care include a dedicated Social Worker to ensure a care plan is put in place.  This may include plans for access to family members where appropriate.  It will also deal with school placement and referrals to other services.</p>  <p>  Tusla provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association which provides supports to carers, including training and a phone advice service.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I am due to meet with representatives from the Irish Foster Care Association tomorrow where the difficulties experienced by foster carers will be further explored. </p>  <p>  Tusla faces some challenges, however, in securing specialised foster care placements for children with a disability, behaviour problems or for older children.  Tusla has an active procurement policy to ensure it can access specialist foster care services to meet the specific needs of individual children.</p></reply>

Before we commence such a process, it is important that we do not lose sight of the breadth and considerable scope of the Commission's existing terms of reference and the specific matters which this House sought to be investigated in the public interest. </p>  <p>  The function of a Commission of Investigation is to establish the facts.  The three Reports of the Commission into Mother and Baby Homes which are due for completion by February 2018, namely, the Social History Report; the Confidential Committee Report, and the Investigative Report, will be critically important in this regard.  The Reports will assist us in trying to come to terms with how Irish society responded to vulnerable women and their children at a time when they most needed our support and assistance.</p>  <p>  Notably, the Confidential Committee forum was specifically designed to facilitate former residents of these homes who may wish to provide accounts of their experience, and to assist the Commission to ground its work in the reality of the experience of mothers and children.</p>  <p>  In recent days, I have committed to exploring the potential for the application of a range of transitional justice mechanisms to acknowledge the experiences of former residents and further enhance public awareness and understanding of a range of past abuses and human rights failures.  Any additional mechanism must be complimentary to and properly align with the work of the Commission on Mother and Baby Homes, which is already deep into its program of work.  I have begun a process of  consultation on how this work could proceed and that dialogue is continuing.</p></reply>

The young people are aged between 13-17, all boys and come from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria, and South Sudan.  These young people have been allocated social workers and have been placed in residential settings while their care needs are being assessed.  I would note that, during this process, assistance to reunite the young person with family is provided where it is possible to do so.  Further missions to France are planned, with the valued cooperation of the French Ministry of the Interior, for April 2017.  </p>  <p>  To coordinate Tusla's role in this effort, the Calais Special Project (CSP) has now officially been launched by the Agency and is being led operationally by their separated children's team.

It also included representatives from the Health Service Executive (HSE), the National Early Years Inspectorate at the Child and Family Agency, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), the National Disability Authority (NDA), Better Start National Early Years Quality Development Service (NEYQDS) and the City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs). </p>  <p>  The Report of this IDG was launched in November 2015.  The IDG based its conclusions on national and international evidence and consulted with a range of key stakeholders.  The IDG acknowledged the huge benefits to children with disabilities of attending mainstream pre-schools; however the IDG also recognised that a small number of children will continue to require specialist pre-school services, due to very complex needs arising from their disability.</p>  <p>  The IDG recommended introducing a model of seven levels of support, ranging from universal to more targeted supports.  The IDG concluded that such a child (and parent) centred model would build truly inclusive practice in a workable and sustainable manner and generate effective cross-sectoral working between education and health.  Based on this recommendation, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs launched the &lsquo;Access and Inclusion Model&rsquo; (known as AIM) in June 2016.</p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of the IDG, two cross-Government groups were established to drive and oversee the implementation of AIM: a Cross-Sectoral Implementation Group and a Project Team.  These groups review progress on implementing AIM on an ongoing basis and they are attended by the same organisations who participated in the IDG.  Accordingly, consultation between my Department, the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills is regular and on-going. </p>  <p>  As regards situating AIM within a National Strategy, the IDG and AIM were established in response to an action set out in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures Access, the National Policy Framework for Children and Youth People.</p></reply>

The decision to close was taken by the management of this service.  In a bid to ensure continued childcare provision in this disadvantaged area, Pobal and the local County Childcare Committee have co-ordinated with local stakeholders, including Longford County Council, who have committed to infrastructural support to the service.  I am prepared to make once-off funding available to assist in the start up of a service also, and have committed to consider any and all proposals from potential operators.  Organisations involved at local level have been strong advocates for the provision of a more comprehensive service that would meet the needs of this vulnerable community and reduce the impact of adverse childhood experiences which are prevalent. </p>  <p>  However as yet, no stakeholder has been in a position to commit to the establishment and operation of a childcare service.  As my Department cannot operate a service directly, we are not in a position to arrange for a re-opened service at this time.  I am aware of the need in the area and Pobal and the local County Childcare Committee are continuing to seek partners who may be in a position to operate a childcare service in this area.  In the meantime, the County Childcare Committee has worked with impacted families to ensure that they can access childcare in alternative facilities in the area.</p></reply>

As the Deputy knows, in Budget 2017, I was pleased to secure additional funding of &euro;14.5m, to help ease the burden of administration on childcare providers by paying for 'non-contact time' on top of existing payments.  Officials are making the arrangements necessary to administer this payment, which will be made in summer 2017.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I have made provision for &euro;1 million of funding to be provided to services whose sustainability is challenged by the full implementation of the Childcare Regulations 2016, particularly in relation to their reliance on Community Employment Scheme participants.   </p>  <p>  Given the importance of financial sustainability for the provision of quality childcare, the Programme for Government committed to conducting and publishing an independent review of the cost drivers associated with providing quality childcare in Ireland.  This commitment aligns closely with work on the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme, including options for further development of the Scheme over time.  Initial scoping work on the independent review is being progressed in that context.  The independent review is a priority action for the Department in 2017.  </p>  <p>  Any service experiencing difficulties should contact Pobal or their City/County Childcare Committee who will liaise with officials in my Department</p></reply>

The Bill is intended to facilitate access to adoption information and operates on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible.  It provides clarity around the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided to those affected by adoption.  The definition of an adopted person in the Bill is as follows:</p><p><i>&ldquo;adopted person&rdquo; means a person -</i></p><p><i>(a) adopted under an adoption order,</i></p><p><i>(b) born in the State and placed for adoption outside the State by An Bord Ucht&aacute;la, a person who was at the time a registered adoption society, the Authority or the Agency, and whose adoption was effected outside the State, or</i></p><p><i>(c) otherwise adopted in accordance with the law in force in the State at the time of that adoption;</i></p><p>Irish children who were adopted in Ireland and then went to USA are included in a) above while Irish children whose adoptions were finalised abroad, be that for example the USA or UK, are included in b) above.  The definition of adopted person in the Bill was drafted so as to ensure service provision in all historic adoptions where a child was placed and brought up outside the State primarily in the USA.  All persons affected by these adoptions will be entitled to the service provision under Part 4 and 5 of the Adoption (Information and tracing ) Bill 2016.</p><p>There will be an information campaign for six months following commencement of the Act to publicise the provisions of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  Tusla will liaise with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to identify the methods of maximising contact with persons outside of the State affected by Irish adoptions through media outlets, social media and other appropriate methods.</p></reply>

In addition to more than 4,000 centre-based childcare providers, which operate independently in a market context, all Tusla-registered childminders will also be eligible to participate in this Scheme.  It is acknowledged however, that the number of Tusla-registered childminders is currently small.  In order to meet the needs of parents whose preference is to use a childminder, and to build capacity to cater for increased demand in future years, my Department has established a Working Group on Childminders.  This Working Group, which is chaired by Childminding Ireland, and includes officials from Tusla and my Department, will make recommendations on reforms and supports necessary for the childminding sector in the short, medium and long term.  As part of their deliberations, the Working Group will consider the reforms and supports necessary to enable the cohort of childminders who are not currently eligible to participate in the Affordable Childcare Scheme  to do so.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question on addressing childcare costs, the Affordable Childcare Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined scheme which is more user-friendly for both parents and providers.  The new scheme will make childcare more affordable, and will enable both universal and targeted subsidies for parents towards their childcare costs.  Targeted subsidies will be available for children aged from 6 months up to 15 years and will address families&rsquo; full-time and part-time childcare needs, including outside of school hours and during school holiday time.  The level of subsidy will vary based on the parent&rsquo;s income, with the highest levels of subsidy provided to those on the lowest incomes, helping families to overcome disadvantage and contributing to a reduction in child poverty.</p>  <p>  The impact of the scheme on affordability depends on the subsidy rates and income thresholds set within the scheme, which reflect the level of public funding available.  Budget 2017 allocated an additional &euro;19m on top of funding from the existing targeted schemes.  As a result of the subsidy rates and income-thresholds proposed for the initial rollout of the scheme, I expect that the majority of current beneficiaries will see an increase in their level of subsidy.  In addition there will be a significant increase in the number of families that will benefit from subsidised childcare for the first time, including up to 25,000 families that will receive the universal subsidy.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme is intended to provide a robust and flexible framework for future public investment.  Any future increases in the level of public investment will allow for additional support to further improve the affordability of childcare.  Further investment may be used to increase income-thresholds and subsidy-rates in the scheme.</p></reply>

On 4th May 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs signed new Childcare Regulations, which came into effect on a phased basis from 30th June 2016.  Some of the main changes in the new Regulations are as follows:</p><p><b>Registration</b>&ndash; Services must be registered with Tusla (The Child and Family Agency) before being permitted to operate.  Before deciding on registration, Tusla will carry out a pre-registration visit to ensure that the premises are fit for purpose.</p><p><b>Qualifications</b>- All staff members working directly with children in pre-school services must hold at least a major award in early childhood care and education at level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), or a qualification deemed by the Minister to be equivalent.  It is also a requirement of the ECCE Grant Funding Agreement that all pre-school services participating in the ECCE programme must hold a level 6 qualification.</p><p><b>Management </b>- All pre-school services must demonstrate that they have a clear management structure in place, and that each member of staff is aware of her or his specific role and responsibilities.  All staff must be appropriately supervised and provided with training.  As well as ensuring that all staff have been Garda vetted, the service provider must ensure that robust human resources procedures are in place for the recruitment of staff, including the seeking and careful scrutiny of references.  </p><p>In addition, funding continues to be provided for quality initiatives in the early years sector.  These include:</p><p><b>Approximately &euro;1m has been provided to the Early Years Inspectorate of Tusla over the last 2 years to increase the number of inspections. </b>My Department has funded the Early Years Inspectorate in the Department of Education and Skills to carry out education-focused inspections on pre-school services delivering the ECCE programme.  This is to ensure a greater focus on the quality of the educational provision of the programme, and to identify poor practice or areas requiring improvement.</p><p><b>The Better Start National Quality Support Service </b>funded by my Department, employs early childhood specialists to work directly with pre-school services to support quality improvement.<b>The Learner Fund </b>was introduced in 2013, and since then has provided financial assistance to thousands of Early Years practitioners in upskilling.  Recently, my Department issued bursaries to Early Years practitioners who had upskilled to NFQ Level 7/8/9 in Early Childhood Care and Education.  The next iteration of the Learner Fund is under design and details will be released later in 2017.</p><p><b>Roll-out of S&iacute;olta and Aistear - </b>&euro;0.5m per annum has been provided for the national quality and curriculum frameworks.</p></reply>

The additional information requested by the Deputy is not collected by Tusla.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 14 of the 17 administrative areas met the target of 90% of children in care having a written care plan.  The additional funding of &euro;37 million which I secured for Tusla in 2017 should result in higher levels of children in care having a written care plan. </p>  <p>  The placement of children in care is governed by Regulations which provide, inter alia, for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions.  A care plan for each child who is received into care is required under the Child Care Regulations, 1995.  The regulations stipulate that all care plans are to be reviewed and updated on a regular basis and sets out the frequency for these reviews to take place.  A review of the care planned for the child under the Child Care Act, 1991, as amended, is a process to monitor and review the progress of the plan and to update it if required.  A key consideration for the social worker is to consult with the child, family member, foster carers, and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.</p></reply>

I met with the Adoption Rights Alliance on 1st February and a comprehensive discussion took place in regard to all aspects of the Bill.  In particular detailed discussions took place on the Alliance's view on the measures contained in the Bill to address a balancing of the right to identity of an adopted person versus right to privacy of birth parents.  These measures are core to the constitutional law that the Bill strives to address. </p><p>I wish to reiterate that my aim and policy intention is to provide a much information as constitutionally possible, as is available on record, to adopted persons.  However in saying that, no matter what operational mechanism is utilised to achieve this objective, measures to balance the right to identity of an adopted person versus right to privacy of birth parents are required.  Thus measures have been designed to achieve this including:</p><p>a) a mechanism by which an affected birth parent could express a preference for no contact;</p><p>b) a sufficient time period during which am extensive awareness campaign would be conducted to ensure the said birth parents are made aware of the mechanism;</p><p>c) the provision to notify birth parents of receipt of application from adopted person for birth certificate information;</p><p>d) an ability for that birth parent to make representations regarding the release of information - both to the Agency and to the Court;</p><p>e) an undertaking by the adopted person undertaking not to make contact with the birth parent;</p><p>f) counselling and advisory services would be made available to all throughout the process while at the same time allowing the State to provide adopted persons with the maximum of personal information, if on record. </p><p>I have asked my officials to take account of the issues raised by the Adoption Rights Alliance in their on going deliberations on the finalisation of the legislation.</p></reply>

The School Completion Strategy is a commitment in the Programme for Government and is a particular priority for me. </p>  <p>  I will work closely with the Minister for Education and Skills in developing this new Strategy.  In preparing it, I want to make sure that it takes full account of a number of important inputs.  Firstly, the recently published Review of the DEIS Programme, which targets supports to schools and students in the most disadvantaged areas will inform the development of the School Completion Strategy.  The results of the DEIS Review will have an important influence, for example, on where we should target our attention for support in school completion.</p>  <p>  Secondly, I will take account of the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion which is focused on securing good educational outcomes for all children, especially those at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  Thirdly, I want the Strategy to be built on an improved system of governance and operational management.  Tusla has already taken steps in this area to strengthen the operation of the existing School Completion Programme.  This is based on the ESRI Review of the Programme that was prepared on behalf of Tusla last year and these reforms are critical in advance of a new strategy. </p>  <p>  I want to ensure that the new School Completion Strategy meets the needs of our most disadvantaged children and that it charts a realistic, children-focused approach for the years ahead. </p>  <p>  I hope to progress the Strategy in the second half of 2017, leaving time for the inputs from the DEIS Review and the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  I think it is important to say that the School Completion Strategy will go further than the School Completion Programme does in that it will deal with school completion across all schools rather than just being limited to DEIS schools.  The development of the strategy must be cross-departmental and inter-agency in nature to include all relevant educational and other partners; management bodies, statutory Education &amp;amp; Training Boards, representative bodies for school management, Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility.  I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard.  Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p>  <p>  With regard to valuation, Section 28(4) of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides that a revision of valuation to a particular property can be undertaken only if a material change of circumstances has occurred since the valuation of the property was last revised.  A material change in circumstances is defined as a change of circumstances, which consists of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors.  I am advised by the Valuation Office that if such a material change, within the definition in the Act, has occurred in relation to a specific property, the occupier can apply for a revision of the valuation in respect of the premises for a prescribed fee of &euro;250.  The relevant application form, Form R1, is available on the Valuation Office's website, www.valoff.ie, along with associated explanatory documentation. </p>  <p>  Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation they receive from the Valuation Office.  A dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of the issue of the proposed valuation certificate.  The Valuation Office will consider any such representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.  If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.</p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors.  This has been the policy of successive governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis.  This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date.  Revaluation is an important instrument in addressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area.  In fact, the general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following a revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is most welcome and is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances.</p>  <p>  The current phase of the national revaluation programme is known as "REVAL 2017" and covers the revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century and which also includes the second revaluation of the South Dublin County Council area.  The revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards.  The programme will then be extended to other counties including County Wexford which is tentatively listed for inclusion in the next phase of revaluation to be commenced this year.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, I am advised that it is not the practice of the Valuation Office to comment on the specifics of individual properties.  I am advised that the property in question was last subject to a revision of valuation in 2000, at the request of Wexford County Council.  At that time, the existing valuation was considered to be adequate and was not revised.  However, as outlined above, it would be possible for the owners of the property in question to apply for a revision of valuation if a material change in circumstances has occurred in the interim.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, since the College re-opened in September 2014, a total of 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table, as provided by the Commissioner, the number of new Garda recruits, since recruitment resumed in Templemore in 2014, currently assigned to each Garda division.<table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>No. of newly  attested Garda allocated </th></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

This means that 92% of the Report's 173 recommendations are now implemented, partially implemented or are in progress.  This is a significant increase on the 80% reported in the first audit of progress published last June.  I am especially pleased that the key recommendation of the Working Group, the introduction of a single application procedure within our international protection process, has been implemented, following commencement of the International Protection Act, 2015 on 31 December last.  </p>  <p>  Under the single procedure, an applicant will make one application, and will have all grounds for seeking international protection and to be permitted to remain in the State examined and determined in one process.  This will positively address another key recommendation of the Working Group, the length of time which applicants spend in the process and consequently in the Direct Provision system.</p>  <p>  I can also confirm that legal issues around the extension of the remit of the Offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include access for residents in Direct Provision centres have now been clarified.  I am pleased to say we can now give effect to this recommendation and I now expect that information will be made available by both Offices to residents in all accommodation centres.</p>  <p>  The latest audit report also highlights the many improvements in living conditions for applicants and their families in Direct Provision Centres including the introduction of an independent living system in Mosney which will be rolled out to other centres during the course of 2017 and beyond.  These improvements are in line with our commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to reform the Direct Provision system.  </p>  <p>  Significant progress has also been made in dealing with those in the protection process for the longest time.  When the Working Group examined the figures in 2015 there were 2,695 people in Direct Provision for 3 or more years.  As of 1st January this year, this has been reduced by 55% to 1,204 people.  The number of people in the system for 5 years or more has reduced by 58% from 1,946 to  811.  Only 251 of these are awaiting a final decision on their protection application and the vast majority of these cannot be processed for various reasons such as pending judicial review proceedings.  In effect, this means that almost all cases in the Direct Provision system for over five years that can be processed have been.  </p>  <p>  Details of progress on all of the 173 recommendations are available in the audit report which has been posted on my Department's website and on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.</p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon. </p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government  also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  These initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.</p><p>In summary, to the end of 28th February 2017, the numbers of persons that have arrived under both the programme refugee resettlement strand and the relocated asylum seeker strands of the programme are set out in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively.</p><p><b>Table 1: Programme Refugees</b><table><tr><th>Total People</th><th>Adults</th><th>Minors</th><th>Age 0-4</th><th>Age 5-12</th><th>Age 13-17</th></tr><tr><td>627</td><td>287</td><td>340</td><td>105</td><td>184</td><td>51</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Relocated Asylum Seekers</b><table><tr><th>Total People</th><th>Adults</th><th>Minors</th><th>Age 0-4</th><th>Age 5-12</th><th>Age 13-17</th></tr><tr><td>320</td><td>180</td><td>140</td><td>52</td><td>65</td><td>23</td></tr></table></p><p>Further numbers have of course arrived under both of the above strands since 28 February.  Full details on the two primary strands of the programme are set out below for the information of the Deputy.</p><p><b><i>Resettlement strand of the programme</i></b></p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.</p><p>In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  260 refugees have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and are expected to arrive in Spring 2017.  Most of these refugees are also Syrian.  A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in the coming months to select the remaining refugees due to come to Ireland in 2017 under the resettlement programme.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><b><i>Relocation strand of the programme</i></b></p><p>Despite initial delays outside of Ireland's control in respect of the operation of the 'hotspots' on the ground in Greece, Ireland has to-date taken in a total of 320 people from Greece under relocation, another 78 people have been formally accepted and are awaiting transport arrangements, and a further 155 have been assessed and are awaiting clearance.

Applications processed in the seven Visa Offices abroad generally have a shorter processing time.</p>  <p>  The Policy Document on Family Re-unification published in December, 2013 contains a stated business target that visa applications to join Irish citizens should be dealt with within six months of receipt of application.  However, it should be noted that this is a business target and does not constitute a legal obligation.  The business target reflects the detailed and often complex assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification.</p>  <p>  While the Visa Office endeavours to have applications of this nature processed as quickly as possible, processing times for visas can vary based on a number of factors such as the number of applications, individual circumstances, the complexity of applications, whether further information or investigation is required, and the resources available.  Any delays in achieving the business target are primarily related to the processing of more complex cases where the provision of additional documentation is requested or where detailed assessments of family rights under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights are required. </p>  <p>  The central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is decided on its own merits taking all relevant factors into account.</p></reply>

A copy of the policy can be found on the Department's website (www.justice.ie) and it has been communicated to all relevant staff who have also received specialist training in the provisions of the Act and the policy.  The other vote holding bodies in the Justice sector have their own individual Protected Disclosure policies in place in line with the requirements of the Act. </p><p>The policy advises workers to report to their line manager in the first instance.  If a worker is reluctant to do this, they can report to the next highest level of management or to the Head of Internal Audit who acts as the final recipient for internal reporting.  Alternatively, as provided for in the Act, an individual can make a disclosure externally to other recipients. </p><p>On receipt, the procedure is that each disclosure is assessed by the Internal Audit Unit.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Internal Audit Unit is an independent function reporting to an Audit Committee and also to the Secretary General.  The preliminary assessment will determine if the disclosure comes within the scope of the legislation.  Some issues, for example, may be more appropriate to the Civil Service <i>Dignity at Work </i>policy.  The assessment will determine if the disclosure can be defined as a Protected Disclosure which will then be investigated.  At all times the details of the discloser are maintained in a confidential manner in line with the requirements of the Act.  </p><p>The disclosure will generally be investigated by the Internal Audit Unit although in some circumstances it may be appropriate to appoint an external investigator.  I am informed the investigator will meet with the Discloser personally and discuss the issue in more detail.  The investigation process considers all evidence and determines if a wrongdoing has occurred.  On completion of the investigation, the investigator makes a determination, assesses the further action required and outlines same in a report that is given to both the Discloser and the organisation.  The Discloser is kept informed throughout the process.  </p><p>The policy provides the option of a review process where a Discloser is not satisfied with the outcome of the initial investigation.  An external reviewer reviews the file and assesses whether the evidence is available on file to back up the determination and findings made from the initial investigation.  My Department has appointed a retired judge as the External Reviewer for this purpose.  </p><p>In line with section 22 of the 2014 Act, my Department publishes an annual report on matters dealt with under this internal policy.  In 2015 there were 5 such communications received, of these 3 did not relate to my department, 1 was deemed not to be a protected disclosure and 1 disclosure was investigated and upheld.  10 communications were received in 2016; however 6 did not relate to my Department, 3 were deemed not to come within the scope of the Act and 1 is under review.  An annual report in respect of 2016 will be published on the Department's website in due course.  </p><p>It is important to note that in certain instances my Department receives correspondence which is more appropriate for investigation by other organisations or agencies.  In these instances the discloser will be informed that the communication is to be forwarded to the appropriate organisation for follow up.  For example, where appropriate, correspondence may be forwarded to, for example, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission or the Courts Service or another Government Department. </p><p>The Department is fully committed to ensuring that high standards are put in place throughout the organisation and its agencies, with a view to encouraging people to speak up.  A number of steps have been taken to promote and support those who wish to make a disclosure, including detailed training delivered by external experts to approximately 500 managers on the 2014 Act and the relevant policies.  In addition, both the Department and a number of its agencies have signed up to the Integrity at Work initiative delivered by Transparency International Ireland.  This is aimed at promoting awareness of the Protected Disclosure Act and supportive working environments for anyone reporting concerns about wrongdoing and driving improvements in the culture and conditions in organisations relating to disclosures.  My Department's policy encourages workers who wish to make a disclosure to contact Transparency International Ireland for support and advice.</p></reply>

The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years. </p>  <p>  Chapter 3 of the McAleese Report gives the history of the Donnybrook Magdalene Laundry.  The sisters of Charity took over the Donnybrook Laundry in 1833.  It was re-located to Donnybrook Castle in 1837 and was re-named St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum.  In 1992 the premises was sold to a private company which operated a commercial laundry there until 2006.  This former Magdalen Laundry building at Donnybrook was never in State ownership and I have no authority to give instructions as to its future development or in relation to any consultation process to be followed.  Planning permission for any development on the site is a matter for the relevant planning authority.

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. </p><p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p><p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. </p><p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and commenced Second Stage on 31 January 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. </p><p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p></reply>

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;65.1 million in 2016.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive respresentations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scope and scale of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

On this basis it is estimated that by increasing audit staffing resources by c.125 staff an additional exchequer yield of &euro;62.5m per annum could be achieved.  It was estimated that by increasing staff on compliance projects such as oils, tobacco and alcohol by 100 could raise &euro;20m per annum. </p>  <p>  It was noted that the investment in the training and development of a Revenue auditor or investigator can take up to three years, depending on previous relevant experience.  Therefore, the full additional yield would not be available immediately.</p>  <p>  Revenue undertakes a range of risk management interventions to target and confront those who do not comply, including tax evasion and black market activity.  The objective is that people are deterred from filing inaccurate returns and from engaging in shadow economy activity and smuggling.  The range of interventions has increased in recent years.  Interventions include appraisals, aspect queries, profile interviews, assurance checks, enforcement, investigation and prosecutions, as well as audits.  The appropriate intervention depends on the relevant risk.  The average rate of return on each type of intervention varies depending on the intervention.  In some types of interventions to tackle evasion and the black economy, such as enforcement, the focus is on the detection of drugs and fiscal smuggling where the direct exchequer yield is not the immediate objective.  It must also be recognised that Revenue has to prioritise its resources and must, for example, provide service for compliance, by making it easier and less costly to voluntarily comply.  </p>  <p>  In the preparation for the Estimates of 2015, 2016 and 2017, Revenue made business cases for additional resources, which I fully supported.  Over the Budgets of 2015, 2016 and 2017, an increase of 266 (126, 50 and 90) in additional Revenue resources was provided to deal with a wide variety of staffing requirements across audit and compliance functions, debt management functions, international tax, etc.  This Government will continue to carefully consider any request by Revenue for additional resources.</p></reply>

The deduction will be increased by 5 percentage points each year, with the first increase from 75% to 80% having taken effect from 1 January 2017.  Based on personal Income Tax returns filed for the year 2014, the latest year for which this information was available, and making certain assumptions about the data, it was estimated that the full-year cost of the 2017 increase from 75% to 80% deductibility will be &euro;14 million, and the full-year cost of the restoration from 75% to 100% by 2022 will be &euro;70 million.  Extrapolating from these estimates, a reduction in the allowable deduction for mortgage interest for all residential landlords from the current position of 80% to 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% could yield in the order of &euro;224 million, &euro;196 million, &euro;168 million, &euro;140 million, &euro;112 million, &euro;84 million and &euro;56 million respectively.</p></reply>

It is important to point out that the exact impact of carryover will be reviewed as part of the normal Budgetary process, as there are a lot of moving parts to be considered, such as economic growth, take up of various schemes and specific tax relevant factors, which could impact on the expected return from the measures.  A summary of these measures and their impact is set out in the following table.</p><p>Summary of measures and their impact<table><tr><th>Tax-Head</th><th>Carryover effect &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Income Tax </td><td>-69</td></tr><tr><td>Universal Social Charge</td><td>-55</td></tr><tr><td>Capital Acquisition Tax</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>Excise Duties</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Capital Gains Tax</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Section 110 and Fund Changes*</td><td>-15</td></tr><tr><td>Tackling offshore tax evasion*</td><td>-30</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>-172</td></tr></table></p><p>*The carryover is calculated as the difference between the effect on a full year and that on 2017.  For example, in relation to Section 110, it was estimated at the time of Budget 2017, that these changes would yield &euro;50 million in 2017 and &euro;35 million is a full year, which equates to a negative carryover of &euro;15 million into 2018.  While the yield from tackling offshore evasion would result in a one-off yield in 2017 of &euro;30 million, and therefore represent a negative carryover of &euro;30 million in 2018.</p><p>On the expenditure side, which is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr Paschal Donohoe T.D., and as detailed in Parliamentary Question number 184 of 16 February 2017, there is an estimated carryover into 2018 of approximately &euro;0.4 billion arising from certain increases in Departmental expenditure included in the Budget Estimates for 2017.  The spending review, scheduled to be carried out in advance of Budget 2018, will among other issues, consider the policy options for meeting the additional cost arising in 2018 of the Budget 2017 expenditure measures.</p><p>Carryover costs impact the fiscal space in the year in which they arise.</p></reply>

As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax.  Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. </p>  <p>  However, in 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)).  The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. </p>  <p>  During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS.  The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation.  The research paper, available on the ESRI website, presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland.  A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios).  In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined. </p>  <p>  The wealth tax scenario in the research paper that is closest to the wealth tax outlined by the Deputy in his question is the high threshold-large exemptions scenario as outlined in Table 5 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study.  This scenario has a personal threshold of &euro;1.0 million (doubled if married and a &euro;500,000 increase per child), applies a 1% tax rate and excludes farms, the household main residence, business and pension assets.  Given it is not identical to the scenario outlined in the Deputy's question, care should be taken in interpreting the revenue estimates.  This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;53 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study.  The research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioural response to the tax is modelled.  The estimate of &euro;53 million, therefore, is likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised.</p>  <p>  In order to estimate the yield from a tax with the precise parameters as outlined in the Deputy's question, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose.  This would be a significant undertaking that would take considerable time and resources to complete.  It is also noted that the HFCS does not include specific data on the global assets for those domiciled or ordinarily resident and the domestic assets for those resident for tax purposes.  As such, any estimate on the yield obtained from HFCS data would not fully capture the parameters outlined in the Deputy's question. </p></reply>

In relation to these policyholders, the cap of 65% applies and in total payments of &euro;608,085 have been made to date to such Setanta policyholders.  </p><p>3rd party motor insurance claims are unlikely to be processed until after the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal.</p><p>The Liquidator for Setanta has informed me that: </p><p>- Claims provision required stands at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million. </p><p>- Setanta policies were cancelled in May 2014.  The 2 years allowable under the statute of limitation to lodge claims has expired so the claims figures will not increase further. </p><p>- The Liquidator reports that it is proving difficult to settle claims in advance of the outcome of the MIBI appeal. </p><p>- The Liquidator continues to be of the view that he will not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims.</p><p>I expect to be able to provide a more accurate update after the legal proceedings are concluded.</p></reply>

The Policy provides that the appropriate contact for any disclosures outside the normal reporting channels is the Head of Internal Audit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A disclosure however can also be made outside of these normal reporting channels; for example to: a legal advisor, a Minister of the Government, and a 'prescribed person' under SI 339 of 2014 and SI 448 of 2015.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform is in the process of establishing a multi-supplier framework agreement for third parties to provide services to public bodies related to the Protected Disclosures Act.</p>  <p>  Under the Department's Protected Disclosures Policy, when a recipient receives a Protected Disclosure they must undertake an initial assessment within 14 days of receipt of the disclosure.  If the recipient determines that an investigation is required, the Secretary General will then nominate a senior official to investigate the matter.  The fact of such an investigation will be reported to the Head of Internal Audit.  Both the Secretary General and the Head of Internal Audit will also be advised of the outcome and any recommendations arising.  The individual making a disclosure will be advised of the progress and outcome of the investigation as appropriate having regard to the nature of the matters investigated, of the outcome of the investigation.  Some matters, however, may be of such seriousness that the investigation will more appropriately be carried out externally or by professional experts and in some cases may need to be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or another body with the statutory power and function of investigation of particular matters.</p>  <p>  As provided for under Section 22 of the Act, a report will also be prepared and published on an annual basis setting out the number of disclosures made to the Department in the previous year, the actions taken in response to those disclosures and any other information as may be requested by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Act.  In 2015, there were no Protected Disclosures made to the Department. Details concerning 2016 will be published on the Department's website shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department is strongly committed that any appropriate issue raised by a member of staff relating to a matter connected to the conduct of the business of the Department will be dealt with professionally and appropriately.</p></reply>

NAMA holds security over properties that are owned by its debtors or, in the case of enforcement, which are managed on behalf of those debtors by duly appointed insolvency practitioners.  As a result, where properties which secure NAMA loans are brought forward for sale, such sales processes are managed by the relevant debtor or insolvency practitioner.</p><p>The NAMA website <i>(</i>) includes a list of properties to which receivers have been appointed and which are either for sale or are likely to be offered for sale through receivers in the near future.  The NAMA website does not include properties being sold by NAMA debtors or their agents, as to do so would identify NAMA debtors and NAMA is legally precluded from doing so.  Properties for sale by NAMA debtors, their agents or receivers are sold on the open market and are advertised through the usual sales channels and property websites.</p><p>I am advised by NAMA that its debtors and receivers control only a small number of properties in County Sligo and that these are either being prepared for sale or are the subject of court actions.  I am further advised by NAMA that there are currently no properties securing NAMA loans for sale in County Sligo.</p></reply>

In this regard, it should be noted that insurance for activities is not generally a compulsory  requirement, with the obvious exception of motor insurance.  Any decision to make it compulsory would have to be made by those more familiar with the risks associated with the use of drones.  In this regard, I understand that the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA)  requires all drones weighing more than 1 kg or more to be registered.  I also understand that the IAA  encourages all drone users (recreational and commercial) to familiarise themselves with all rules and regulations  relating to drone safety prior to use.  In addition the IAA provides information on the safe use of drones at <i>www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones.</i></p><p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation including insurance. Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Therefore the question of whether an insurance provider is willing to cover the risk of drones used by amateurs and hobbyists will be based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.</p></reply>

Its conclusion was  that it is not possible under the current legislative framework to provide for individuals to source motor insurance for Irish registered vehicles from insurers in other Member States.</p>  <p>  In coming to this conclusion, it examined the existing legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the European Union (EU), as well as Irish law.  The EU framework allows for the freedom to provide services from one Member State into another throughout the Union.  This is a key principle of the European Union and is availed of by a number of insurance firms established in Ireland in order to conduct business into other EU Member States, and also by companies authorised elsewhere conducting business into the Irish market.  This can be done either through:</p>  <p>- establishing a branch operation in the host country and thus conducting business on a 'freedom of establishment' (FOE) basis; or </p>  <p>- writing business from the home country (i.e. where authorised) into the host country on a 'freedom of services' (FOS) basis.</p>  <p>  In both situations for companies wishing to do business in Ireland,  there is a requirement to become a member of the national bureau ( Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI)) under Section 78 of the Road Traffic Act. This is an important requirement as the MIBI is the body in Ireland tasked with meeting the EU requirement of compensating victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  This position has been upheld in the case of DPP v Lepina and Suhanovs where one of the conclusions was that a vehicle registered  in the State must be insured by a vehicle  insurer who is a member of the national bureau (MIBI).</p>  <p>  In summary, therefore a vehicle registered and based in Ireland can legally only take out insurance with a company who is a member of MIBI which means that by definition they cannot purchase motor insurance in another Member State where such companies will be members only of their own national bureau.</p>  <p>  This is a complex issue which would require a solution at EU level.  The Working Group therefore recommended that my Department support efforts and raise awareness of the need to improve cross-border motor insurance provision at the European level.  This work is ongoing and my officials continue to monitor the issue and raise it in the relevant forums.</p></reply>

The Central Bank manages and administers the Resolution Fund. The purpose of the Resolution Fund under the 2011 Act is to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution.  In particular the Resolution Fund may be used for: </p><p>- the payment of financial incentives for transfers; </p><p>- providing capital for a bridge bank (details of a bridge bank are set out in Part 4 of the 2011 Act); </p><p>- meeting the expenses of the Central Bank incurred when discharging functions under the Act, and </p><p>- making certain payments under the Act, for example, the payment of expenses to an assessor appointed under the Act. </p><p>To date, the resources of the Resolution Fund have been utilised to fund the resolution of 5 credit unions.  In the case of 3 of those credit unions, the resolution action taken was a directed transfer under the 2011 Act, and the Resolution Fund funded a financial incentive for the transferee.  The 2 remaining cases were liquidation cases, where no incentive was paid from the Resolution Fund in respect of those resolutions.  In each of the 5 cases, the Central Bank discharged its third party resolution-related costs against the Resolution Fund.</p><p>The amount paid or payable to date in relation to resolution cases from the Resolution Fund is circa &euro;31.3 million.  This was for incentives paid in each of the 3 outlined credit union transfer resolution cases as follows: </p><p>- Newbridge Credit Union Limited: c &euro;27 million</p><p>- Howth Sutton Credit Union Limited: &euro;2.15 million </p><p>- Killorglin Credit Union Limited: &euro;2.15 million</p><p>The Resolution Fund is administered by the Central Bank and I have been informed that the names of the individual institutions that have contributed to the fund cannot be provided due to confidentiality reasons.  Under section 12(2) of the Resolution Act 2011, the Minister for Finance is entitled to be reimbursed from the Resolution Fund for all contributions to the fund and for any financial incentive provided. </p><p>All credit institutions as defined in the 2011 Act excluding those exempted under section 3(2) paid into the Resolution Fund in 2012, 2013 and 2014.  In 2015 the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) was adopted and Member States banks were required to pay into a separate domestic BRRD fund.  In 2016 Irish banks came under the remit of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and all BRRD contribution were transferred to that fund.  As credit unions do not come within the scope of the BRRD they have remained within the Resolution Fund.  As per the financial statements for the Resolution Fund the following levies have been collected to date: </p><p>- Period 28 October 2011 to 31 December 2012 - &euro;2.445 million </p><p>- Year ended 31 December 2013 - &euro;9.621 million </p><p>- Year ended 31 December 2014 - &euro;9.299 million </p><p>- Year ended 31 December 2015 - &euro;7.310 million </p><p>- Year ended 31 December 2016 - &euro;7.659 million </p><p>I have been informed by the Central Bank that to date, as per the financial statements, net resolution costs of circa &euro;30 million have been expensed through the Resolution Fund with the fund currently holding &euro;255 million with another &euro;2 million due in outstanding levies.</p></reply>

Its aim is make sustainable and appropriately priced finance available to viable Irish SMEs and support investment by them that encourages growth and facilitates employment across the whole country.  The SBCI does not lend directly, rather it lends its funds to SMEs through lending partners, known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has eight on-lending partners, three bank and five non-bank.  The SBCI is seeking to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage by adding new on-lenders and working to develop innovative products, thereby serving to drive competition in the SME finance market. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that, to the end of December 2016, the SBCI has lent circa &euro;544 million to 12,589 SMEs supporting an estimated 67,150 jobs.  These figures represent a significant increase in lending by the SBCI during 2016.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors and are spread across every region of the country.  More than 80% of loans are for investment purposes and the average loan size is &euro;43,000.  There is a broad geographical spread of the SMEs supported with approximately 85% of them based outside Dublin.  The SBCI is using its significant funding capacity, of over &euro;1 billion, to support Irish SMEs investing in and growing their businesses.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I have made inquiries in the matter and find that NEPS made no arrangement in relation to the assessment of this child in July 2015.  However, I can advise the Deputy that the NEPS psychologist for the school the child in question is attending has recently received a request for involvement in this case from the school and is in the process of arranging a suitable date for all parties so that an assessment can take place.</p></reply>

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  I am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the Constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. </p>  <p>  The eight week phase of receiving written submissions is part of the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps. </p>  <p>  My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions, which includes the submission to which the Deputy refers, and formulating next steps.  Clearly I will not make any decisions around next steps until such time as all of the submissions have been examined and considered.</p></reply>

Therefore, they should, on employment to a permanent position through open or confined schemes of appointment (or other mechanism) to another Public Service post/position or on employment on a temporary basis (including by way of substitution or on a fixed term contract) in one of the grades affected, be assigned to the appropriate pre-1 January 2011 scale in such a new post/position.</p>  <p>  However these arrangements apply only where the person is being employed in the same or an analogous grade/role as their previous public service employment, whether that employment was permanent or temporary.  As an example, a person employed as a lecturer who assumes a new lecturing role will remain on the rate applicable before 1 January 2011.  However if that person following their first period of employment as a member of the administrative staff obtains a permanent contract of employment as a lecturer in a university, the revised rate at 1 January 2011 applies.</p></reply>

It allows schools to target support to those pupils who have the greatest degree of need at any given time, recognising that the level of need that a child may have may be variable over time.  The school is in a position to use their educational experience and expertise to manage the level of support which has been allocated to them to provide for the care needs of identified children as and when those needs arise and to provide access to SNA support for all children who have been granted assess to support. </p><p>An additional 115 SNA posts, at an annual cost of &euro;3.8m, is available to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to allocate to schools from January to June 2017, bringing the total number of SNA posts available for the 2016/17 school year to 13,015, which represents an increase of 23% over the numbers allocated in 2011.  This is the highest allocation of SNA posts that we have ever had.  This increase reflects the growing participation of children with special educational needs and will support their full participation and progression within the educational system, reflecting the Programme for Government commitment to ensure that all children with special needs can maximise their potential.  The demand for 2017/18 will not be known until the NCSE SNA application process has been completed.</p><p>The NCSE has published details of the SNA posts allocated to schools for the current school year, 2016/2017, on its website <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p></reply>

The Council immediately began work on a call for proposals for the development of new enterprise-led apprenticeships.  The call issued in January 2015 and over 80 proposals were received from industry stakeholders working with education and training providers.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council has been working with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them in sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  In recent months we have seen the first of these new apprenticeships coming on stream with the launch of the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, developed jointly by the Insurance Institute of Ireland and the Institute of Technology Sligo, in September 2016.  The new Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship also got underway last year, commencing in November 2016.  Some 13 further new apprenticeships are due to get underway later this year in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.</p>  <p>  I have also launched an Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, which sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year.  Over the lifetime of the Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes which represents a doubling of current activity. </p>  <p>  Registrations in the 27 craft apprenticeship trades are rising strongly as the employment and economic situation improves and I welcome that employers throughout the country are engaging strongly with the apprenticeship system.  In 2015 there were 3,153 registrations in existing apprenticeships which represented a 17% increase on the previous year.  In 2016 there were 3,742 new registrations in craft apprenticeships, a further 19% increase.  This year the strong growth in new registrations continues with 893 apprentices registered at the end of February, 36% increase on the same period last year.  Current forecasts are that annual registrations will increase to 4,147 in 2017 and 4,697 in 2018.</p>  <p>  A campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council.  The campaign will raise awareness and promote the values of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.</p></reply>

The Government's decision to establish the Redress Scheme was made regardless of whether the religious congregations who managed the institutions would contribute to the Scheme or not. </p>  <p>  The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provided for the establishment of both the Residential Institutions Redress Board and Review Committee and a total of 139 institutions were included in the schedule of specified institutions to the Act including 16 added by way of ministerial order in 2004 and 2005.  While the majority of these institutions were managed by the 18 religious congregations who were party to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, others were managed by other congregations, State bodies, and voluntary bodies/management committees or pursuant to Trusts. </p>  <p>   The Indemnity Agreement between the Government and the 18 contributing religious congregations was signed on the 5th of June 2002 and provided for a collective contribution of &euro;128 million comprising cash, counselling services and property.

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.</p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools in the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by my Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools.  Of the 79 new schools announced as DEIS schools in February, 25% are based in Donegal. </p><p>The key data sources used in the identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly across all schools in the country.  Schools were not required to submit an application for inclusion in the programme as the centrally held data required was already held by my Department.</p><p>Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at <i>.</i></p><p>Schools which have not been included or upgraded at this stage, including the schools referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification process, which is fair and objective.</p><p>The DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to <i>social_inclusion@education.gov.ie.</i></p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13 February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p></reply>

It chairs the Education and Research Subgroup of the Economy and Trade Workgroup, with members representing State bodies concerned with education, jobs, research/innovation, and science.  It has also participated fully in the Government's All-Island Civic Dialogue events and process.</p>  <p>  A recent meeting of the Education and Research Subgroup principally reflected on the results of stakeholder consultations to date and further meetings will take place with a view to informing strategy and responses on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  During my visit to London for St Patrick's Day, I met with several key UK Ministers, including Secretary of State for Education Justine Greening, and politicians, as well as Irish groups.  I took the opportunity to raise all of the Government's key Brexit priorities and, in particular, those relating to education.  The discussions focused primarily on movement of people, North/South issues, labour market supply, research and opportunities for Ireland in the post-Brexit era.  The UK Ministers clearly expressed their wish to continue the priority they attach to the close co-operation and relationship with Ireland and will aim to protect that to the greatest extent possible after Brexit in the upcoming talks with the EU.</p>  <p>  Among the key education issues identified by the Government are Brexit's likely impact on the future of the Common Travel Area and its implications for students, teachers, academic staff and researchers, mutual recognition of qualifications, continued co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement, UK/Ireland research collaboration and partnerships between education institutions and enterprise as well as the implications for EU funding for research and the impact on EU funding programmes such as Horizon 2020, PEACE IV and Erasmus+. </p></reply>

The programme aims to provide young people with the knowledge, skills and confidence to participate fully in society and progress to further education, training and employment.  </p>  <p>  The staff in Youthreach is made up of Youthreach Co-ordinators, Youthreach Resource Persons and teachers.  Youthreach Co-ordinators and Resource Persons have their own terms and conditions and are a separate grade to teachers.  Accordingly, they do not require to be registered with the Teaching Council, which is the body with statutory authority under the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 for the professional regulation, including registration, of teachers in the State.  In addition, Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, 2001 does not apply to Youthreach Centres as they do not fall within the definition of recognised school.</p>  <p>  The pay and conditions of Youthreach Co-ordinators and Resource Persons were set by an Arbitration Board in December 1998 which decided that the pay of Youthreach workers should be adjusted in line with those applicable under the Community Workshop Agreement.  This aligns Youthreach staff with staff in Community Training Centres (CTCs).  CTCs provide education and training to a similar age cohort of learner under the global Youthreach umbrella.</p>  <p>  The Youthreach programme requires staff who are flexible, multi disciplined and experienced.  While relevant qualifications are desirable, no qualifications are specified for staff working in the programme.  This is intended to give ETBs maximum flexibility to recruit staff with the combination of personal qualities and professional skills most likely to meet the often complex needs of participating learners. </p>  <p>  Teachers are also employed in Youthreach and it is a matter for each ETB to decide on the staff required for the programme being delivered in their Youthreach centres. </p>  <p>  Certification is available to all learners in Youthreach mainly at levels 1-4 on the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) Framework.</p></reply>

The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school.  </p><p>Children with disabilities have access to pre-school services under a new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) programme of supports, which was announced in June 2016, by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. </p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school. </p><p>The supports include:</p><p>- A new Inclusion Charter for the Early Years sector, alongside updated and strengthened Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines for Early Childhood Care and Education. </p><p>- In relation to the qualifications of early years practitioners, a new higher education programme for early years practitioners (LINC) which will commence from September 2016. </p><p>- A new national specialist service which is based in the Better Start National Early Years Quality Development Service will provide expert advice, mentoring and support to pre-school providers from  a team of 50 specialists in early years care and education for children with disabilities. </p><p>- A new national scheme will provide specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations which are necessary to support a child's participation in the ECCE programme. </p><p>- A new national scheme will also provide additional capitation to pre-school providers where this is critical to fund extra support in the classroom and enable a child's participation in pre-school.  It is estimated that only 1 to 1.5% of children in pre-school will require, and therefore be eligible for, this scheme of additional capitation. </p><p>Details of the supports which are available under AIM can be found at <i>www.preschoolaccess.ie</i>which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports.  For children attending a private pre-school through the ECCE programme, questions relating to the AIM supports should be addressed to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that when a child with special educational needs is due to commence school, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is an independent statutory agency, is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including SNA support.  The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>in order that students with special educational needs who have additional care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO.  Contact details are also available on the NCSE website.  The local SENO is also available to discuss any concerns that parents have about the present or future educational needs of their child.</p></reply>

Home tutors do not have a contractual relationship with the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p>The change in payment arrangements from September 2015 was on foot of instructions from the Revenue Commissioners that payments under the Home Tuition Scheme are subject to statutory deductions at source.</p><p>In order to facilitate parents, my Department agreed to act solely as payroll agents on their behalf.

Schools will be front-loaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support. </p><p>Where parents have concerns that their child is not getting access to the support the child needs, they should raise this concern with the Principal and in the event that they are not happy with the response they should raise this with the Board of Management. </p><p>As the profiled allocation is made to the school, schools may appeal the basis of this allocation and specifically whether the data used to calculate the profile was correct and whether it was correctly applied in the case of the school.</p><p>The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017. </p><p>Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p><p>In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.</p><p>The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.</p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p></reply>

The options included a predominantly state-funded system, increased state funding with continuing upfront student fee and increased state funding with deferred payment of fees.  The report also recommended that employers should contribute more to the funding of higher education and that the scope of the National Training Fund should be extended to include greater support for programmes in higher education and the levy should be increased to facilitate this.</p>  <p>  The report is currently being examined by the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills with a view to making recommendations on a future funding model for higher education.</p>  <p>  The state currently provides a significant proportion of the core funding for higher education.  In Budget 2017 increased Exchequer investment in  higher education of &euro;36.5m was secured, the first significant reinvestment in higher education since the beginning of the financial crisis and was made in response in the first instance to intensifying demographic pressures.  In addition, provision is again being made in the Department&rsquo;s expenditure ceiling in 2018 and 2019 for demographic increases in the higher education sector which cumulatively will represent an additional &euro;160m investment by the Exchequer in the sector in the period 2017 &ndash; 2019.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, on foot of a commitment in Budget 2017 and arising from a recommendation in the Expert Group report, I and my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, launched a public consultation process on 10 March 2017 on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training.  The investment mechanism on which views are sought in the consultation process is the proposed incremental increase of the National Training Fund levy by 0.1% each year between 2018 &ndash; 2020.  It is estimated that should employment levels reach those forecast for 2020, together with the assumption of moderate growth in incomes, an increase in the levy from the current rate of 0.7% to 1% by 2020 could yield close to an additional &euro;200m.  Comments on the proposal may be submitted to the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform by 5 p.m. on Thursday 13 April 2017.  Full details of the consultation process are available on the websites of both Departments.</p>  <p>  The intention is that, taken together, these approaches will contribute to and inform the development of a sustainable long-term funding model for the higher education and further education and training sectors and will help to drive continued reform, quality and performance improvement across the sectors in line with the ambitions and objectives set out in the policy frameworks for the sectors.</p></reply>

Such responsible dog ownership is the key to reducing incidences of dog biting and other problem behaviours.</p>  <p>  The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 to 2010 set out a range of requirements for all dog owners or any other person in charge of a dog.  In particular, section 9 of the 1986 Act requires the owner or any other person in charge of a dog to accompany it and keep it under effectual control in any place other than the premises of the owner, the premises of the person in control of the dog, or other premises with the consent of the owner of the premises.  Section 21 of the 1986 Act provides that the owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for damage caused in an attack on any person by the dog.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foregoing, the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 set out further requirements that owners of specific breeds of dogs have to follow, namely that such dogs must be muzzled and led, on a sufficiently strong leash or chain not exceeding 2 metres in length, by a competent person over 16 years of age when in a public place.  The specific control requirements for these restricted breeds are a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners, respects animal welfare to the extent possible, while also taking account of the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury, or cause death.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the restrictions under the current legislative framework are fit for purpose and there are currently no plans to review the legislation.</p></reply>

The duty of care provisions have been augmented by the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 and associated regulations.

The grant scheme ensures that the limited financial resources available are targeted towards householders, particularly those on lower incomes, who incur expenditure directly as a result of the implementation of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.</p>  <p>  Full details of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, are set out in the explanatory leaflet and application form published on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie/water/water-quality/domestic-waste-water-systemsseptic-tanks/domestic-waste-water-treatment-0.</p>  <p>  It is not proposed to make any changes to the grant scheme at this time.</p>  <p>  Householders who do not meet the eligibility criteria for the grant under the aforementioned Regulations and who wish to remediate or upgrade their on-site treatment systems may qualify for relief under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme introduced pursuant to Section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  The HRI Scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including the repair or replacement of septic tanks.

In that jurisdiction, a vehicle excise duty evasion survey is carried out on a bi-annual basis.  The results of the 2015 survey, the first following the abolition of the disc, found that the rate of unlicensed vehicles observed on the road was much higher than had been observed in the previous survey in 2013, prior to the abolition of the disc.  The survey concluded that the increase is probably due to the changes in the vehicle licensing system which took effect from October 2014.  Any question of abolishing the disc in Ireland will take note of the longer-term U.K. experience; however, I consider it too early to make a definitive assessment at this time.</p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Eoghan Murphy, T.D., published a Report on the cost of motor insurance in January of this year.  This report is available at: www.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/banking-financial-services/financial-services-division-2-eu/insurance-policy-and-0.</p>  <p>  The Group considered the issue of the abolition of the paper-based insurance disc as part of its deliberations.  The decision of the Working Group was that it was not recommending the phasing out of the paper-based insurance disc at this time.  In arriving at its conclusion, the Group noted the experience in the U.K. following the removal of the paper motor tax disc and, in terms of enforcement, set out that Ireland is not yet in a position to underpin an enforcement regime where technology would be the primary method of enforcement.  In relation to the use of ANPR, the Group recommended that the phasing out of the paper insurance disc should be reviewed in the future as the development of technology progresses.  The continued use of the paper motor tax disc will also be kept under review in that context.</p></reply>

While the 2009 Act provides the Minister with limited powers to issue directions and guidance to authorities as to the performance of their housing functions, Section 6 of the 2009 Act specifically precludes the Minister from intervening in individual housing cases.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are independent in performing their functions, as provided for under section 63 of the Local Government Act 2001.  The Minister has no role in the normal day-to-day operations of individual local authorities.  The Minister's role in respect of local government is primarily to provide the policy, financial and legislative framework within which local authorities perform their functions.</p>  <p>  In that context, it is important to note that the Local Government Act 2001, Part 15, includes important provisions in relation to the ethical framework applicable to the local government sector, including providing a statutory basis for a code of conduct that has been issued for all local authority employees.  In the ordinary course of events, it would be a matter for the relevant local authority, in the first instance, to investigate any allegations of malpractice regarding the operation of its housing allocation system.  Subject to the outcome of any such investigation, it would then be for the local authority to consider what further action, either internally or by way of referring the matter to other relevant appropriate authorities, may be required.  However, where the outcome of any such investigation undertaken were to give rise to legislation or policy issues which fall within the remit of my Department, these would of course be considered.</p>  <p>  I am aware that Galway City Council undertook an investigation into an improper housing allocation.  The Council has advised that the outcome of the investigation was that actions taken in relation to a social housing allocation were outside of the standard protocols and procedures for social housing allocations.  In addition to disciplinary action which I understand was taken by the Council, housing allocations procedures have also been reviewed by the Council and a Housing Allocations Group has been established within the Council&rsquo;s Housing Department to review and agree on social housing allocations before a recommendation is made.</p></reply>

Almost three quarters of the  households removed by Sligo County Council were excluded for failing to engage with the Council or a failure to meet all of the eligibility criteria.  A similar proportion of the numbers removed by Leitrim County Council were for a failure by households to meet all of the eligibility criteria, households no longer residing in the Council's administrative area or a failure to engage with the Council.</p>  <p>  Under the 2016 SSHA process, housing authorities were required to review those households who were on their housing list to ensure that the details of the applicant households are up to date and accurate and that they remain eligible for, and in need of, social housing support in accordance with the criteria set down in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations.  As part of this assessment, all local authorities wrote to relevant households during 2016, including those in transitional and shared or emergency accommodation where relevant, informing them of the assessment process and seeking updated information where necessary.</p>  <p>  Where a household responded and was found to no longer meet the qualification criteria for social housing support in light of their updated details, they were removed from the list.</p>  <p>  In the event of an initial non-response by a household to a request for updated information, guidance issued by the Housing Agency advised housing authorities to contact the household again and to use all reasonable means of communication available to them in contacting the applicant.  Authorities were also advised to undertake local advertising campaigns informing households about the Summary.  Where a number of attempts to contact a household failed to elicit a response, authorities were advised that it was not unreasonable to then close the household&rsquo;s application.  However, housing authorities were also advised that should the household subsequently respond with the information required within a reasonable time, the application could be re-activated.</p>  <p>  Detailed and complete data on the total number of households removed from all housing authority lists as part of the process for the SSHA 2016, and the reasons for such removal, is not yet available.  Provisional figures based on replies from 25 of the 31 housing authorities indicate that in excess of 28,000 households were removed from lists as part of the 2016 SSHA process.  Once the complete data set is compiled and verified, it will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.housing.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  My Department does not hold information on the number of households that were removed from the lists that may be in emergency accommodation.  Monthly homelessness data reports are produced by housing authorities using the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS), the single integrated national data information system on State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements overseen by housing authorities.  The data is collated on a regional basis with the counties of Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal comprising the North-West region.  My Department collates this information into monthly national homeless reports, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/homelessness/other/homelessness-data.</p></reply>

The following table provides a breakdown of the 42 CWS clinics closed since 2015 on a county basis.  Information regarding the cost of the provision of clinics is not available.  </p><p>Where the service has been restructured alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.  This means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased, an improved phone and appointments service is generally available and alternative arrangements are in place for those who cannot travel, for example due to illness, including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home as necessary.  </p><p>CWS clinics in Laytown and Duleek will move to the main Intreo Centre in Drogheda with effect from 3rd April 2017.  A large proportion of customers accessing the CWS in both Duleek and Laytown are already dealing with the Intreo Centre in Drogheda.  This move will enable customers to access all services in the one location eliminating the need for them to visit a second office to make a claim for supplementary welfare allowance.  The service availability will increase from one to three mornings per week which will provide a greater level of flexibility to clients accessing the service.  The Intreo Centre provides a comprehensive information service on the full range of supports provided by the Department and this will enable customers to clarify all their queries in relation to employment and income support services in one location.</p><p>The Department has written to all customers affected by this move and the feedback to date has been positive with the expanded opening hours being seen as a very positive development.  For some customers travelling to the Intreo office in Drogheda is much more convenient especially for customers in areas such as Highlands, Grangerath, Backbush Avenue, Ard Ri and Deepford.  All customers have been informed that a CWS officer will be available to carry out a home visit where a customer cannot access the clinic due to incapacity or for any other legitimate reason.</p><p>I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer-facing services at a local level for all customers of the Department and would like to reassure the Deputy that the changes to the services are intended to enhance the integration of all of the Department&rsquo;s localised services.  </p><p><b>CWS Clinic Closures by County and Year of Closure</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 *</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td></td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td></td><td>2</td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>27</td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td>42</td></tr></table>*to date in 2017</p></reply>

In this regard, where a permanent post falls to be filled by transfer the relevant transfer list is consulted.  In addition to having to satisfy attendance and performance criteria, the question as to whether the person can be released from their current office/Department arises.  There are a number of reasons why someone might not be released, e.g. they may be required to serve in their current location for a specified period of time, there may be no suitable replacement available should one be required, or the business needs of the office are such that releasing an experienced person cannot be facilitated at that point in time.  If a person is not suitable or cannot be released they retain their place on the transfer list for future opportunities and the next person on the list is considered.</p>  <p>  An increase in the work undertaken in the Department&rsquo;s Longford office required the ongoing assignment of a significant number of new staff last year.  The Department's priority is to ensure that service is provided to its customers.  Therefore, in order to maintain service delivery to those depending on the schemes operated in that Office, it has not always been possible to release experienced staff until new staff are fully trained up.  The position is subject to continuous review with a view to being able to facilitate staff transfers when opportunities arise in the future.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-28a.562.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800066#WRK03500"><p>Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold.  First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work, to ensure that as many as possible of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people. </p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 14.5% (30,500 persons) in February 2017 estimated by CSO, as compared to 17.2% (32,600) persons in February 2016 and a peak of over 31% (70,600 persons) in 2012.  Unemployment data are not available at the county level.  </p>  <p>  However, the number of young people signing on the Live Register in offices in Sligo and Leitrim (which may serve as an indicator of trends in unemployment) has fallen from 1,430 in February 2012 to 720 in February 2017.  I know that the Deputy will very much welcome this information. </p>  <p>  While systemised data is not readily available on employment outcomes for specific programmes nationally or at county level, some indicative figures are available for people aged under 25 at a national level.  For example:</p>  <p>-  The evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon (report published October 2016), shows on the basis of self-reported survey results that 61% of interns aged 20 to 24 years (and 53.8% of those aged 15-19) were currently in employment at the time of the survey.  Overall, individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed).</p>  <p>  -  JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  In October 2016 there were 4,323 participants benefiting from JobsPlus, 765 (17.7%) of whom were under 25.</p>  <p>  -  In 2015 the level of satisfaction among under 25 year old Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job was very high at 4.27, of a possible maximum of 5.</p>  <p>  -  2016 results from the Customer Satisfaction Survey will be published shortly and show a similar high level of satisfaction among under 25 year olds Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job.</p>  <p>  Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities. </p>  <p>  For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth. Long-term unemployed jobseekers under 25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.   </p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020 sets additional targets in relation to addressing youth unemployment: 1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed; 2) to ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month; 3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers &ndash; these consolidate reforms undertaken in previous Pathways to Work strategies; the fourth action, to implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme, is a new programme.  The First Steps Programme has now been restructured and the pilot Skills For Life programme has been completed.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these policy measures, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment and support further improvements in the labour market situation for young people across the country.</p></reply>

Both schemes provide significant support to unemployed people such that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced payment, subject to continuing to satisfy all of the qualifying conditions.  </p>  <p>  The goal of Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy is to ensure that as many jobs as possible go to people on the Live Register.  Ensuring that work always pays and preventing long-term dependency on welfare are important aspects of this strategy.  In-work supports such as family income supplement (FIS) and the back to work family dividend (BTWFD) are key because they are stepping stones to ensure that recipients are better off in employment and can work towards financial independence over time.</p>  <p>  FIS targets families with children on low incomes where the parent works at least 19 hours per week.  The payment effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might otherwise be only marginally better off than if s/he were claiming other social welfare payments. </p>  <p>  The BTWFD allows those who had been in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment (including jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment) and recipients of the one-parent family payment, to retain their full increase for a qualified child payment for the first year of employment, tapering to 50 per cent in the second year.</p>  <p>  Where a long term unemployed jobseeker is offered employment of more than 3 days but less than 24 hours a week, they may be eligible for the part-time job incentive scheme.  Under this scheme they can receive a weekly payment of &euro;119 per week if they are single or &euro;193.90 if they have an adult dependent.</p>  <p>  ESRI research, based on an analysis of current incomes, benefits and taxes, has found that people are better off in work than on welfare.  It demonstrates that more than 8 out of 10 unemployed jobseekers would see their income increase by at least 40 per cent upon taking up employment.  Fewer than 3 per cent would, in the short-term, be financially better off not in work.  Although the risk of facing weak financial incentives to work is higher for unemployed persons with a spouse and children, less than 1 in 15 of that group would be financially better off not working.  The BTWFD reduces that figure to 1 in 20.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.  The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15 per cent in 2012 to 6.6 per cent in January 2017.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the combination of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments, FIS, BTWFD and the part-time job incentive scheme provides considerable support for people to take up employment by allowing them retain access to a social welfare payment.  However, my Department is currently analysing incentives to work in the social welfare system for jobseekers with children in the context of a working family payment.  The main principles guiding this work are to make work pay and to reduce child poverty.</p></reply>

Measures of unemployment from the QNHS are based on International Labour Office (ILO) definitions.  To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record.  It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level. </p><p>This includes providing data and trends broken down by age categories.  The QNHS data, being prepared as part of the EU-wide Labour Force Survey, also allow Irish trends to be compared with international developments. </p><p>The Pathways to Work strategy, the key document setting out policy to facilitate the unemployed of all ages back into work, is underpinned by analyses of the labour market situation based on the statistical sources mentioned above. </p><p>By allocating activation resources to persons on the Live Register, the government&rsquo;s policy tends automatically to focus on those areas and age-groups in which unemployment is most concentrated.  The focus on those most in need is further reinforced by the use of profiling to identify, among the newly unemployed, those most likely to face severe difficulties in re-entering employment.  People identified as having a low PEX (probability of exit from unemployment) score are prioritised for intensive engagement and support from the Intreo employment service.  Finally, the introduction of JobPath over the last 2 years has led to a greatly increased focus of employment service resources on those who are out of work for long periods.</p><p>This policy approach has seen a sharp reduction in long-term unemployment &ndash; from over 200,000 (9.5% of the labour force) in 2012 to just under 80,000 (3.6% of the labour force at the end of 2016.</p><p>While data from the QNHS are not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in unemployment.</p><p>The Live Register age breakdown for offices in County Leitrim and County Sligo for February 2017 and 2011 is given in Table 1.  Overall, the number of people on the Live Register fell by over a third over this period, in both counties; while for those aged under 25 the fall was almost 60 per cent.  </p><p><b>Table 1.

This includes programmes such as T&uacute;s and Community Employment (CE).  As the Deputy will be aware, both of these schemes provide part-time temporary work for participants in local communities as a stepping-stone back to employment.  These schemes help to break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market. </p>  <p>  I am conscious of the valuable contribution the schemes are making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland.  Many participants on T&uacute;s and CE are working in placements that assist tidy towns initiatives and the schemes will continue to support this valuable work.  Participation limits on work schemes are important as they allow for the utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons to ensure the benefits of participation are available and shared amongst the widest possible number of jobseekers.</p>  <p>  The current eligibility rules and maximum durations allowed for participants are quite varied in terms of the underlying age, duration and other terms and conditions that apply across the employment programmes.  This makes it very difficult for potential participants to understand and also for the overall administration of the schemes.

The decision was communicated by the Board of CIB to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on the same day.  The CIB assures me that there will be no job losses, no closure of services, no change to service delivery locations and no change to the terms and conditions of serving staff during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  There will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them. </p>  <p>  The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The decision taken simply reduces the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  </p>  <p>  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone Services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).</p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.  Current costs are an aggregate of the costs incurred by each of the ninety three (93) local companies on items such as audit fees, professional fees (including legal services), payroll administration and board of director expenses.

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many as possible of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register. </p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing unemployment and long-term unemployment in particular.  The rate of long-term unemployment has fallen from a peak of 9.5% to 3.6% in Q4 2016.  The actual number of people who were long-term unemployed in Q4 2016, at 79,700 as cited in the question, is also very substantially down  from a peak of over 200,000 in early 2012.  These figures can be expected to fall further this year in line with the forecast fall in overall unemployment. </p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy continues to prioritise actions for the long-term unemployed.  This includes the roll-out of the payment-by-results services of JobPath to engage more systematically with the long-term unemployed; providing targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and through reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes. </p>  <p>  The JobPath service procured by my department provides additional resources to enable it to provide a high quality, case-managed employment support service for people who are long-term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  The aim is to assist participants in finding sustainable full-time paid employment by providing intensive individual support and assistance.  </p>  <p>  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in long-term unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years. </p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 425,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;232 million in 2017.  Applicants for household benefits aged 70 or over do not have to satisfy a means test. </p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment must also satisfy a means test.  All non-contributory recipients are accepted as satisfying the means-test.</p>  <p>  A fuel applicant and members of his/her household may have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;100.00 a week above the appropriate rate of State Pension Contributory and qualify for a payment.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  The &euro;100 a week means limit is significantly higher than the weekly fuel allowance rate of &euro;22.50 and also the combined weekly total of household benefits and fuel allowance added together (&euro;33.65).  It might be remembered that more than half of our pensioners are solely dependent upon the State pension, and so a person who has additional pension income above &euro;100, is not among the more disadvantaged people that Fuel Allowance is targeted at.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines for the Fuel Allowance Scheme are kept under review.  However, any decision to change the means test for fuel allowance to make it more generous to people in receipt of a private pension would have cost implications, and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition to being in receipt of a qualifying payment a person must live alone or only with certain excepted people and also be unable to meet the costs of heating their home.  This information, required to assess eligibility, is not collected from Illness Benefit claimants, and so it is not possible to say what percentage of them would qualify for fuel allowance if eligibility was extended.  Any decision to so extend the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a recipient of a social welfare or health service executive payment who has exceptional essential heating costs due to ill health or infirmity and who cannot provide for such costs from within his or her own resources may qualify for a heating supplement.  There is no standard rate for a heating supplement.  Each case is examined on its merits and the Community Welfare Officer determines the amount to be paid taking account of the level of the expenses in question and the ability of the applicant to contribute towards his or her exceptional heating costs.</p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on these issues and in moving forward the actions agreed in the Energy Affordability Strategy.  In that regard, the Better Energy Homes scheme provides support towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments. </p><p>The value of a claimant&rsquo;s family home is not assessable for means assessment purposes.

The balance is then assessed as capital. </p><p>The capital assessment method involves disregarding an initial amount of capital (&euro;20,000 for most social assistance schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, farm assist and the state pension non-contributory), and applying an increasing notional weekly value for amounts in excess of the disregarded amount, as outlined as follows.</p><p><i>Table: Social Welfare Capital Means Assessment (excluding Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Disability Allowance)</i><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The weekly entitlement of the person is the maximum weekly rate of payment for the person less the means calculated.  As the outstanding value of any mortgage is netted off against the market value of the asset no account is taken of mortgage payments.  In this regard it is worth noting that if mortgage payments were taken into account, the people who would benefit would be those who had income or assets of varying levels and, accordingly, these recipients would be treated more favourably than recipients who had fewer or no personal resources. </p><p>As a result of the improvements to the Farm Assist means arrangements announced in Budget 2017, it should be noted that 70% of farm income is now assessed as means, down from 100% (which is equivalent to a 30% income disregard).  Also, an additional annual means disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children now applies, benefitting farm families.  All existing farm assist recipients currently assessed with means will have their payments adjusted to take into account the changes in Budget 2017. </p><p>Farm Assist recipients have also benefitted from the &euro;5 per week increase in the weekly rates of payment paid since 15 March, and the 85% Christmas Bonus paid December last.  Furthermore, Farm Assist recipients are eligible to avail of the 500 additional places on the Rural Social Scheme announced in Budget 2017. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In general, a person must be 12 months or more in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment to be eligible for 1 year on CE.

Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property (including capital) owned but not personally used or enjoyed is assessable for means testing purposes.  However, it does not include property such as the family home a person is personally using or enjoying i.e. residing in or a premises or a farm of land used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, where the property is not being used to carry on a business or is not being farmed, the current market value of the property or land is established (having regard to local property prices) as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages, if any.  The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed as capital by reference to a notional formula. </p><p>The capital assessment method involves disregarding an initial amount of capital (&euro;20,000 for most social assistance schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and the state pension non-contributory), and applying an increasing notional weekly value for amounts in excess of the disregarded amount, as outlined as follows.  This approach reflects the policy of ensuring that those with property and capital of modest amounts receive the most available support, while those with larger amounts of capital contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs. </p><p><i>Table: Social Welfare Capital Means Assessment (excluding Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Disability Allowance)</i><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme is a weekly tax-free payment to employees with children.  The payment is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  In this regard, unless a farmer (or his or her spouse/partner) met these qualifying criteria, he or she would not qualify for a FIS payment.  It should be noted that capital is not assessable for FIS income limits purposes.  Accordingly, if there was an income generated from the land, this would be assessed for FIS, but the value of capital itself, including land, is not assessable in the FIS scheme. </p><p>The most relevant scheme for farmers is my Department&rsquo;s farm assist scheme.  In Budget 2017, I was happy to announce the total reversal of cuts to Farm Assist, a programme which helps more than 8,000 farm families.  The farm assist scheme supplements mostly small farms on poor agricultural land. Recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes. </p><p>As part of Budget 2017, I announced improvements to the means testing arrangements of the Farm Assist scheme.  Since 8 of March 2017, 70% of farm income is now assessed as means for farm assist recipients, down from 100%.  This is equivalent to a 30% income disregard.  Furthermore, an additional annual means disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children now applies for farm families. </p><p>All existing farm assist recipients currently assessed with means will have their payments adjusted to take into account the changes in Budget 2017.</p><p>As also announced in Budget 2017, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and Farm Assist recipients have also benefitted from the &euro;5 per week increase in the weekly rates of payment.

To qualify for the scheme a person must satisfy the means test and be engaged in farming.  The 2017 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of approximately &euro;83 million on the farm assist scheme.</p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation defines a farmer as a person engaged in farming, farming farm land including commonage, which is owned, and used for the purposes of husbandry, is leased, and used for the purposes of husbandry, or does not form part of a larger holding and is used for the purposes of husbandry.  Husbandry is defined as the working of the land with the object of extracting the traditional produce of the land.  This can include the cultivation of crops or trees (forestry) and the keeping of livestock and poultry.  There is no definition of a farm in social welfare legislation and there is no minimum acreage requirement.</p>  <p>  It is not sufficient for a person simply to own a farm of land to qualify for farm assist.  The legislation prescribes that the claimant himself/herself must be engaged in farming.  Therefore, a person who owns a farm of land, but leases, lets or rents out the entire holding does not satisfy this condition and so cannot qualify for farm assist.</p>  <p>  In assessing means for social assistance payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, account is taken of the income and the value of property, including capital, of the claimant and their spouse or partner.  Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property, including capital, owned but not personally used or enjoyed is assessable for means testing purposes.  In such cases, the current market value of the property or land is established (having regard to local property prices) as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages, if any.  The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed as capital as follows: an initial amount (&euro;20,000 for most social assistance schemes) is disregarded; amounts between &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000 are assessed at &euro;1 per &euro;1,000; amounts between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 are assessed at &euro;2 per &euro;1,000; and amounts over &euro;40,000 are assessed at &euro;4 per &euro;1,000.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that capital assessment does not include property which is being personally used or enjoyed by the claimant such as the family home where they reside or a premises or a farm of land used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p>  <p>  Where a person is farming their land, the assessment of means, including for farm assist, is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming and looks at gross income, less allowable expenses necessarily incurred.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017 I introduced new measures in relation to the assessment of means for farm assist.  Since 8 March 2017, farm income is now be assessed at 70%, down from 100%, with an additional annual means disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children also introduced.  It is estimated that this will cost &euro;8.5 million in 2017.  All existing farm assist recipients currently assessed with means will have their payments adjusted to take into account the changes in Budget 2017.  As also announced in Budget 2017 Farm Assist recipients have also benefitted from the 85% Christmas Bonus paid December last and the &euro;5 per week increase in the weekly rates of payment.</p></reply>

The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has committed to circulating draft guidelines to the EU27 within 48 hours of the triggering of Article 50.  These draft guidelines will be discussed among the EU27 throughout the month of April, with a view to their adoption by the European Council on 29 April.  On the basis of the guidelines adopted, negotiating directives will subsequently be prepared for the adoption by the General Affairs Council in May.  The negotiating directives will provide a formal mandate for the European Commission negotiating team, led by Michel Barnier, and authorise the opening of negotiations with the UK, most likely in early June.</p>  <p>  The triggering of Article 50 on 29 March will represent the formal commencement of a process for which Ireland has been preparing intensively and extensively over the last nine months.  Indeed, our analysis and contingency planning have been under way ever since late 2014.  This has included coordinated analysis of all the issues across Government and extensive consultation, including through the all-island Civic Dialogue, as well as with a range of stakeholders.  Through the Cabinet Committee on Brexit, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and of which I am a member, we have identified our particular concerns and priorities and developed our positions ahead of the negotiations.  My Department is working closely with the Department of the Taoiseach with a view to publishing a position paper with regard to the forthcoming negotiations before the European Council meets on 29 April.</p>  <p>  The Government has continued its programme of extensive engagement with EU partners with a view to ensuring that our unique priorities and concerns are clearly understood in advance of the negotiations.  It is also essential to understand the concerns and perspective of other Member States and of the EU Institutions.  In March alone, I have met with my counterparts from Italy, Luxembourg, Germany and Denmark.  Meetings at political level have been supplemented by numerous intensive discussions at official level, in Dublin and in other capitals.  By the end of this month, there will have been face-to-face meetings with all other Member States, in most cases a number of meetings.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these efforts are bearing fruit, as instanced by the reference made during his recent address to the Committee of the Regions on 22 March, by Mr Barnier to the European Union&rsquo;s role in supporting the Good Friday Agreement and in ensuring that the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU does not disturb the balance of the peace settlement and the process of reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  This is consistent with Mr Barnier&rsquo;s previous public comments, as well as the comments of European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, following his meeting with the Taoiseach last month. </p>  <p>  My Department has played a central role in preparing and supporting these efforts and will continue to do so.  Given the cross-cutting nature of the EU-UK dossier, a number of Divisions are very closely engaged with this issue, as are our Missions, under the overall direction of the Secretary General.  The European Union Division contains a specific team dedicated to the EU-UK negotiations, which will take the lead on the Article 50 process within the framework of the whole-of-government approach to Brexit, which is led by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation to the European Union in Brussels will also play a key role. </p>  <p>  We will continue to build on this firm foundation in the coming weeks and months, so as to ensure that our priorities are heard and understood across Europe and are reflected in the EU&rsquo;s position for the forthcoming negotiations.</p></reply>

I understand also that another ESCWA report was withdrawn last month on the instruction of the UN Secretary General.</p>  <p>  I cannot comment on the content of the report, which has been withdrawn on the order of Secretary General Guterres.  Similarly, I do not wish to comment on Ms Khalaf&rsquo;s resignation without being fully sighted on the circumstances surrounding her decision.  </p>  <p>  It is relevant also to note that the majority of the eighteen ESCWA member states do not recognise the State of Israel.    </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there are issues of enormous concern in the continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, and a clear need for these to be discussed in an open and impartial manner.  </p>  <p>  I have argued consistently and repeatedly at EU and UN level that there needs to be a greater focus on the actions and developments in the occupied Palestinian territory which are unjust and which undermine the possibility of reaching a peace agreement.  Ireland has focused in particular on settlement expansion, and on related issues demolitions, evictions and expropriations, but also on a broader range of concerns such as the treatment of Palestinian children by the Israeli security forces, restrictions on the provision of humanitarian assistance to populations in need, and restriction of access to water supplies.  We have made known our concerns regarding discriminatory practices resulting from the occupation. </p>  <p>  A specific recent concern is the legislation passed by the Knesset in February, which aims to retrospectively legalise Jewish settlement outposts built on privately-owned Palestinian land. </p>  <p>  Ireland, and the international community, remains committed to trying to achieve a two state solution to this conflict between neighbours.  The two state solution has been supported by public opinion and by responsible leaders in both Israeli and Palestinian society for many years, based on clear reasoning, and analysis of the various options and alternatives.  A two state outcome remains better than any other model that has been considered.    </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the two state solution, which can deliver peace, equality, security, freedom and justice for both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.</p></reply>

I would urge the Chinese authorities to ensure that they do their upmost to meet their international and humanitarian obligations in this regard.</p>  <p>  The risk of serious harm for the returned is very high, as documented by the 2014 Report of the UN Commission of Inquiry on human rights in the DPRK.</p>  <p>  It is a fundamental principle of international law that states are prohibited from returning asylum seekers to a state in which they would be in likely danger of persecution based on &ldquo;race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion&rdquo;.  This principle, known as the principle of &ldquo;non-refoulement&rdquo;, is set out in Article 33 of the Convention on the Status of Refugees of 1951.  Ireland and China are both party to the Convention and its 1967 Protocol.</p>  <p>  China is also obliged by the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 1984 not to return, expel or extradite anybody to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he/she would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the terms of its 1995 Agreement with the UNHCR, China is bound to cooperate in the field of international protection of and humanitarian assistance to refugees.  In consultation and cooperation with the government, UNHCR staff may have unimpeded access at all times to refugees.  UNHCR also conducts refugee status determination for asylum seekers in China.  However, it is not allowed to do so for DPRK citizens as China considers any such citizen entering illegally as an economic migrant.</p>  <p>  The EU raises the issue of non-refoulement of refugees from North Korea with China regularly and through a number of fora including raising individual cases of concern with the Chinese side.  Specifically, the issue is raised in the context of the annual Human Rights Dialogue between the EU and China.  The last session of this dialogue took place in November 2015.  The next session is scheduled to take place shortly.  The issue of North Korean refugees has been raised in this dialogue since the inception of the dialogue in 1995.  The issue is also raised with China by the EU, where appropriate, in other meetings at both working level and at political level including at the annual EU-China Summit and EU-China High-level Strategic Dialogue.</p></reply>

It aims to exclude people on the basis of their having expressed non-violent political opinions, and is cast in the broadest and most general terms, which could apply to very large numbers of people.  It is akin to earlier legislation which used the same broad definitions to make Israelis who advocated the same opinions liable for financial damages.</p><p>This law, and other recent legislation in Israel, are deeply damaging to that country&rsquo;s international image, and reputation as a democracy. Close scrutiny will now be paid to how the law is operated in practice.</p><p>As well as the territory of Israel, Israel also <i>de facto</i>controls entry to the occupied Palestinian Territory, and it would be further unjust if persons are prevented from entering that territory on the basis of non-violent political opinions held about that occupation, and the behaviour and actions of the occupation authorities.  I am already concerned that Israel is in practice more and more acting to exclude from Palestinian territory international aid and human rights workers, and even political observers, who seek to examine and document the operation of the occupation and the actions of the authorities.  No military occupation should endure in the longer term, but if it is justly operated it should have nothing to hide.</p></reply>

This increased volume of applications is likely be sustained into the summer months and my Department has put in place a number of measures to mitigate the impact.</p>  <p>  The Passport Office is working hard to address the rise in applications.  230 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) have been assigned to the Passport Service to assist with the processing of passport applications and to respond to customer queries via phone, email and social media.  This is an increase of 59 officers over the number recruited in 2015.  The majority of these TCOs are already in place and the remaining officers are expected to join in the coming weeks.  My Department has also requested the Public Appointments Service to assign additional Clerical and Executive Officers to fill recent vacancies in the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Passport Service is engaged in a significant programme of reform which will result in greater efficiencies and convenience for applicants.  The introduction of on-line enrolment option for passport applications is a key customer service initiative under the programme and I expect this new service to start rolling out shortly. </p>  <p>  I will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the effective deployment of staff and other resources in order to minimise the impact of the exceptionally high demand on turnaround times for applicants and on customer service.</p>  <p>  I would ask the Deputy to help to promote good practice in her communications with constituents.  As a matter of best practice, applicants should allow six weeks for a passport applications.  Applicants should check the validity of their passport before booking travel.  If travel is already booked, applicants should consult the Passport Office website to ensure they use the correct channel for their application.  The Passport Office offers a free renewal reminder email service to Passport holders and I urge passport holders to avail of this service.  See www.dfa.ie for more information.</p></reply>

A fee of &euro;55, which is additional to the applicable fee for the issue of a passport, must be paid by the applicant.

An intensive programme of trade missions is a key part of our overall strategy of pursuing market diversification and building resilience into our economy in response to changes in the global trade and investment environment, and the complex challenges presented by Brexit.</p><p>As set out in the Government&rsquo;s new trade and investment strategy, entitled Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 8 March last, we are committed to intensifying the number, focus and market reach of trade and investment missions and events in 2017, in order to deepen existing trade and investment relationships and forging new linkages.</p><p>The overall number of ministerial-led trade missions has increased substantially in recent years.  These high level missions, led by a range of Ministers across all Departments, complement the ongoing year-round work of our Embassy network and agencies in-market, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, in promoting awareness of and confidence in Ireland as a place to invest and do business and in showcasing Ireland&rsquo;s unique strengths.</p><p>The development of the trade mission programme is a collaborative exercise involving input from my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and other state agencies.  Under Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World, we have committed ourselves to further enhancing coherence across Government around trade missions to ensure that these activities are strategically targeted and adaptive to our evolving trade and investment priorities. </p><p>I am acutely conscious of the importance of minister-led trade missions in terms of securing high level access for Irish companies seeking to grow their businesses overseas and increase jobs at home.  Our 80-strong network of embassies and consulates fulfil a vital role in supporting such missions. </p><p>This year, 46 international ministerial-led trade events are planned by Enterprise Ireland with a focus on market diversification and intensification. </p><p>Full details can be accessed at the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

In order to meet this legal requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship in his/her application.</p>  <p>  The applicant referred to was born on 11/2/2015.  His entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (the 1956 Act).  Section 6A of the Act provides that a person born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four preceding his/her birth (a total of 1,095 days).</p>  <p>  The parent of the child has made a declaration that she came to Ireland on 1/07/2012.  As her period of residency in Ireland prior to the birth of the child is 955 days, the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship has not been demonstrated and consequently the child is not entitled to an Irish passport.  There is no discretion allowed under the Act for shorter periods of residency.</p>  <p>  Ultimately as citizenship is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality, it is open to the parent of the applicant to pursue the matter with that Department.</p>  <p>  In the event that an application for naturalisation is successful and a naturalisation certificate issues, a new passport application may be submitted.</p></reply>

While this policy had applied for many years, increased levels of recruitment to the Civil Service following the lifting of the moratorium gave rise to queries in respect of the appropriate pay point at which existing public/civil servants should be assimilated.  It was recognised that starting at the minimum of the scale was a barrier to mobility where the successful candidates were existing public servants seeking a new appointment elsewhere in the public service at an analogous grade. </p>  <p>  In the context of Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan "to expand career and mobility opportunities for staff across geographic, organisational and sectoral boundaries and the matter will be examined in further detail" it was decided to review the policy relating to the starting pay of appointees from elsewhere in the public service, to the Civil Service. </p>  <p>  Such appointees had been treated as new entrants to the Civil Service and appointments were made at the minimum of the scale.  It was decided that with effect from 30th November 2015, where the appointee had been serving elsewhere in the public service in analogous grade and pay-scale, the appointment could be made at the appointee's current point of scale.  This meant that such appointees could be assimilated on their current pay point on the same basis as a civil servant.  Appointees would be required to mark time where their current salary was not an exact match in respect of incremental points. </p>  <p>  The revised arrangements outlined above apply only to appointments in an analogous grade and pay-scale and not to appointments to a higher grade which would be considered as a promotion.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Civil Service, officers who secure promotion by way of internal competition, either via interdepartmental or departmental competition, have their starting pay calculated under the provisions of Circular 34/77 Starting Pay on Promotion or Establishment.  In general, this means the minimum of the scale of the new post where the officer is currently on a lower point or, if more beneficial, at a point equivalent to existing pay plus accrued increment, if any, plus an immediate increment on the new scale.</p>  <p>  Where an officer secures a higher post by way of open competition, paragraph 11 of Circular 34/77 applies and this provides that the starting pay of such officers is determined by the entry pay provisions of the Conditions of Service prescribed for the particular competition.  In most cases this will mean appointment at the minimum of the scale unless there is specific provision otherwise but in some cases an officer may enter the scale of the new grade above the minimum on an off-scale point.  Essentially this allows the officer to retain their current level of pay on a mark time basis. </p>  <p>  Currently there are no formal arrangements in place allowing similar treatment of staff moving from other State bodies to the Civil Service.  However, in light of the wider use of open recruitment to the Civil Service, my Department is conducting a review of policies in this area.</p></reply>

The site is privately owned and is one of the many locations managed by the OPW under the Guardianship provisions of the relevant National Monuments legislation.</p>  <p>  It came to the attention of the OPW in 2010 that the Donaghmore site had suffered some damage.  Specifically, one of the lintols had cracked.  Additionally, a number of vents providing airways into the structure appear to be blocked.  This rendered the site potentially unsafe for visitors and public access, which had previously been available through a local keyholder, was curtailed immediately the damage became known.   </p>  <p>  The OPW is not in a position to state conclusively who was responsible for the damage and is now focused on carrying out the necessary investigation works to assess the possible repairs to the structure.  To date however, the necessary staff have been addressing other more urgent priorities and it has not been possible to make a substantive start on assessment works.  It should also be reflected that, while a number of examinations of the site have been undertaken, the work is hampered by the unstable condition of the Monument and because, it is a confined space as defined by Health and Safety legislation.  This adds considerably to the logistical difficulties involved in accessing the interior of the structure to inspect it fully.   </p>  <p>  The damage sustained to the Monument is a potential structural failure in the first instance and although Archaeological advice is key, the solution and repair will be primarily led by engineering considerations.  Relevant archaeological staff of the Department of Arts Heritage Rural Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs have inspected the site and are working with the OPW to devise the necessary remedial work.   </p>  <p>  It is expected that the investigation will be progressed in 2017 and will be undertaken by the National Monuments Service staff based locally in Trim.  Given the underground nature of the site and the particular hazards associated with such spaces, it is not clear at this time  whether the reinstatement of public access to the Monument will be feasible.  This will be considered only when relevant Architectural and Structural Engineering staff can carry out the necessary work and make a fuller assessment.</p></reply>

This approach is set out in the Public Financial Procedures at C8 Section 11 whereby the general rule is that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which if it arose would fall wholly and directly on public funds.  This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as to materially disturb the financial position of the year, so that it is cheaper in the long term for the Exchequer to "carry its own insurance".</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency is designated as the State Claims Agency (SCA) when performing the claims and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000.  Since the establishment of the SCA, the management of claims functions has been delegated to the agency and it currently manages claims and risks on behalf of 139 delegated State Authorities, including my Department.</p></reply>

This approach is set out in the Public Financial Procedures at C8 Section 11 whereby the general rule is that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which, if it arose would fall wholly and directly on public funds.  This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as to materially disturb the financial position of the year, so that it is cheaper in the long term for the Exchequer to &ldquo;carry its own insurance&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency is designated as the State Claims Agency (SCA) when performing the claims and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.

The Town and Village Renewal Scheme provided funding for improvements to the public realm, tourism infrastructure, town health checks and other similar projects.</p><p>Table 1 below outlines, on a county-by-county basis, the amount of funding which the Local Authorities have reported as having been expended to the end of February 2017 under the Town and Village Renewal scheme and the CL&Aacute;R programme.</p><p>Progress on individual projects under these initiatives can sometimes be weather-dependent, while other projects may only be carried out at certain times of the year in order to minimise disruption to both schools and communities.  Nonetheless, I will be impressing on all Local Authorities the need to have their projects completed as soon as possible.  My Department is also engaging closely with the Local Authorities to ensure that all expenditure is in line with the Public Spending Code and that the funding is spent promptly and in accordance with project proposals.</p><p>The 2017 CL&Aacute;R and the Town and Village Renewal programmes will be launched shortly and the assessment process for applications submitted under these programmes will take into consideration the status of implementation of 2016 projects. </p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Expenditure by county: Town and Village Renewal Scheme and CL&Aacute;R programme</b><table><tr><th colspan="3">Expenditure to 28th Feb 2017</th></tr><tr><td>County</td><td>Town &amp;amp; Village Renewal scheme</td><td>CL&Aacute;R Programme</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>&euro; 162,841.53</td><td>&euro; 8,179.00</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>&euro; 0.00</td><td>&euro; 32,739.33</td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>&euro; 76,740.36</td><td>&euro; 0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>&euro; 0.00</td><td>&euro; 6,443.62</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>&euro; 0.00</td><td>&euro; 0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin*</td><td>&euro; 40,614.00</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>&euro; 70,933.00</td><td>&euro; 98,554.18</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>&euro; 132,420.00</td><td>&euro; 28,289.00</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare*</td><td>&euro; 42,000.00</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>&euro; 0.00</td><td>&euro; 0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>&euro; 0.00</td><td>&euro; 95,500.00</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>&euro; 104,896.00</td><td>&euro; 0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>&euro; 212,213.17</td><td>&euro; 164,035.67</td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>&euro; 89,387.68</td><td>&euro; 3,087.00</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>&euro; 57,882.00</td><td>&euro; 4,767.00</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>&euro; 141,934.00</td><td>&euro; 31,908.00</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>&euro; 57,910.52</td><td>&euro; 0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>&euro; 139,772.00</td><td>&euro; 34,446.00</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>&euro; 0.00</td><td>&euro; 63,773.00</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>&euro; 16,705.00</td><td>&euro; 0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>&euro; 0.00</td><td>&euro; 10,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro; 242,512.00</td><td>&euro; 72,775.26</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>&euro; 129,000.00</td><td>&euro; 169,160.00</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>&euro; 0.00</td><td>&euro; 1,660.00</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford*</td><td>&euro; 54,746.00</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>&euro; 109,833.00</td><td>&euro; 0.00</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>&euro; 1,882,340.26</td><td>&euro; 825,317.06</td></tr></table>*Counties that do not have CL&Aacute;R Areas</p></reply>

The screening of women from the age of 25 is in line with international best practice.</p>  <p>  Invasive cervical cancer is extremely rare in women aged under 25, with less than 5 women in this age group being diagnosed with this condition each year.  While changes in the cells of the cervix are very common for those under 25, in the vast majority of cases these changes will settle and return to normal without intervention.  If the screening age was lowered to invite those under 25 for smear tests, young women could be subjected to unnecessary treatment that could have potential long-term negative effects on their health and fertility.</p>  <p>  The Department encourages all women aged under 25 to be vigilant about their health and to consult their GP immediately if they have any symptoms which could raise the suspicion of cervical cancer.  If necessary, their GP will refer them to a gynaecology clinic for further investigation.  Meanwhile, any women concerned about their family risk of cancer should discuss this with their GP.</p>  <p>  The Department also encourages all 12-18 year old schoolgirls to avail of the free HPV vaccination which is offered in secondary schools.</p></reply>

In 2006, the McKinsey report, <i>Children&rsquo;s Health First</i>, recommended that the population of Ireland and projected demand could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric centre, that this should be in Dublin and that it should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital to ensure relevant sub-specialty and academic linkages.  In 2012, the Dolphin Review Group was commissioned to advise on the progression of the new children's hospital.  Their report stated that &ldquo;co-location is essential and tri-location optimal&quot;, and identified St James&rsquo;s as the most suitable adult partner for the new children&rsquo;s hospital from both a clinical and research perspective.  St James&rsquo;s Hospital has the broadest range of national specialties of all acute hospitals, as well as a strong and well established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to enable the children&rsquo;s hospital achieve our vision of excellence in modern paediatric practice.  In light of the above, the question of carrying out cost comparisons with other potential locations does not arise. </p><p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) was appointed in 2013 to plan, design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St James's site and satellite outpatient and urgent care centres on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  An internationally recognised Design Team supported by an experienced Board and Project Team are in place, and have followed best international design, planning and procurement process at each stage of the project.  A highly competitive tender process, in which local and international companies participated, recently concluded for the core construction cost of the new children's hospital and satellite centres.  More than 35 people participated in review panels for the tenders.  The tenders were reviewed and measured against a number of technical and financial criteria, were independently peer-reviewed by construction experts with extensive experience of projects of this size and complexity and a company has been notified that it is the preferred bidder.  I understand that the final construction elements of the project compare favourably to the costs of international projects of a similar size and scale. </p><p>The updated capital costs have been incorporated into the Definitive Business Case for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, which has been prepared in accordance with the Public Spending Code which requires that projects are properly appraised, including the requirement for a Cost Benefit Analysis.  The NPHDB is continuing to ensure that every stage of the project is delivered in accordance with national policy to optimal design and value for money, and along with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board, continues to work closely with the HSE and my Department to deliver this much-needed world-class hospital.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  In May 2016, 2725 people lived in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.  A congregated setting is defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people. </p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. </p><p>At the end of December 2016, less than 2,600 people with a disability were living in congregated settings.  The HSE's 2017 National Service Plan has set a target of 223 to move from institutions in 2017.  This will  ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community.  I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.</p><p>Issues in relation to the funding of Local Authorities is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  I am pleased to note that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government  is providing funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2017.  CAS funding will also be available to provide housing for people with disabilities in the community more generally that is not specifically targeted at deinstitutionalisation.</p><p>This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>&quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;,</i>I have arranged for the Deputy's questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The first concerns the community rating levy on health insurance contracts and the second matter raised concerns charges for private patients in public hospitals.</p>  <p>  With regard to the first matter, risk equalisation is a mechanism designed to support the objective of a community-rated health insurance market, whereby all customers pay the same net premium (adjusted to reflect any loadings applicable under lifetime community rating) for the same health insurance product, irrespective of age, gender or health status.  Under the risk equalisation scheme, credits are paid to insurers for their older and sicker members.  These credits are funded directly by stamp duty levies on all health insurance contracts written.  The scheme redistributes funds between insurers to meet some of the additional costs of insuring older and sicker members.  The scheme is self-funding and exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State. </p>  <p>  From 1 April 2017 the age-related credits paid to insurers in respect of older people will increase, to help to maintain the existing level of support for community rating.  Increasing the amount of age-based credits provided under the scheme requires changes in the stamp duty levy.  The levy will therefore increase by approximately 10% on all products written from 1 April onwards.  It is important to note that increasing the levy does not automatically increase costs across the market.  All of the monies collected are paid back to insurers in the form of credits.  The amount of any increase or decrease individual insurers pass on to consumers is a commercial decision for each of them.  Insurance companies operate as commercial providers and as Minister for Health, I have no legal power to intervene in relation to any insurer&rsquo;s pricing strategies. </p>  <p>  Regarding the second issue, the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 provides for the charging of all private inpatients.  This Act addressed a situation identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 report whereby when a private inpatient was accommodated in a public or non-designated bed, no private inpatient charge applied.  The report noted that 45% of all private inpatient throughput was not the subject of a maintenance charge because the patient was accommodated in a designated public bed.  A further 5% was not charged for because the patient was accommodated in a non-designated bed, with the result that only 50% of private inpatient throughput gave rise to any maintenance charge at all.  This was despite the fact that due to treatment costs, the type of room in which a patient is accommodated is by no means the major contributor to the overall costs of a hospital stay.</p>  <p>  The absence of a maintenance charge in such instances represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system, to taxpayers and was an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, which cover most private patients.  The charging regime set out in the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 was intended to decrease but not eliminate any gap in the cost of providing services to private in-patients.  The additional income generated as a result of the enactment of this legislation is a key element of the funding to the public hospital system and any curtailment of this funding stream would put pressure on the taxpayer to maintain services.</p></reply>

Details of all costs relating to the new children's hospital project have been included in the total costs as set out in the Definitive Business Case which forms part of the Final Project Brief.</p><p>The NPHDB is also fully compliant with Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which states that <i>&quot;A planning authority may, when granting a permission under section 34, include conditions for requiring the payment of a contribution in respect of public infrastructure and facilities benefiting development in the area of the planning authority and that is provided, or that it is intended will be provided, by or on behalf of a local authority (regardless of other sources of funding for the infrastructure and facilities)&quot;.</i></p><p>In relation to the relocation of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to the St James's campus, thus achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services, a site for the proposed maternity hospital is identified in the Site Master Plan for the St James's campus, and the new children's hospital design has incorporated the required operational links with both maternity and adult hospitals.  A planning application has not yet been submitted in relation to the relocation of the Coombe Maternity Hospital to the St James's Hospital Campus.  While the construction of the new maternity hospital on the campus will not commence until the new children&rsquo;s hospital is completed, consideration will be given to the work required to advance the new maternity hospital design, which must be done before a planning application is prepared.</p></reply>

This approach is set out in the Public Financial Procedures at C8 Section 11 whereby the general rule is that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which, if it arose would fall wholly and directly on public funds.  This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as to materially disturb the financial position of the year, so that it is cheaper in the long term for the Exchequer to "carry its own insurance".</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency is designated as the State Claims Agency (SCA) when performing the claims and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.

In particular, in relation to services for older people, information is available regarding:</p><p>-  Home Care/Home Help;</p><p>-  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme <i>A Fair Deal</i>, and nursing homes in Ireland;</p><p>-  Community Services;</p><p>-  Information on protecting older people;</p><p>-  Tips for Health Living;</p><p>-  Information for Carers;</p><p>-  Useful contact information for various organisations who provide assistance and advice on issues relevant to older people.</p><p>However, issues affecting older people are not purely health-related.  The National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS), published on 24 April 2013, highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens.  The NPAS provides a framework for cooperation to address age-related policy and service delivery across Government and society in the years ahead.  The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  </p><p>At the launch of the Strategy, a commitment was made to publish an Implementation Plan to facilitate the translation of the Goals and Objectives of the Strategy into action on the ground.  The approach to implementation originally included in the Strategy would have worked where a finite number of discrete and concrete steps could be taken after which the implementation could be deemed complete.  However, many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.</p><p>The Department has therefore formulated new arrangements to implement and monitor the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 27 October, 2016.  The new proposals will see mechanisms established that will give stakeholder groups effective and on-going access to Government Departments and State Agencies relevant to older people.  An Annual Forum for stakeholders is being established which will seek to identify what stakeholders consider to be their key priorities for Government for the coming year and the next three years.  Issues will be considered on a thematic basis and will include Health, Social Protection, Transport, Security, Community Housing and Local Government etc.  Clear channels of communications will be established with relevant Government Departments assigning a named senior official to engage with stakeholder representatives on issues relevant to their remit.</p><p>The inaugural Stakeholder Forum will take place on 30 March 2017.</p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the Strategy and establish an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and well-being linked to the Goals and Objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The Initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.  The first national Positive Ageing Indicators report was published in 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland.</p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy and the activities of the HaPAI are strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health, and where well-being<b></b>is<b></b>supported at every level of society.  The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with<b></b>accurate information on how to improve their health and well-being and to make the healthy choices easier choices.  Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate.</p><p>The Department of Health has no plans at present to develop a nationwide database that would coordinate service providers both public bodies and community organisations that provide community services, as suggested by the Deputy. </p></reply>

However, if returning at a lower grade (e.g. Staff Nurse), they would be remunerated at the maximum point of this lower grade.  The INMO is currently balloting on these proposals.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  In excess of 2000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.  The focus of this initiative will be those lists with large numbers of long waiting patients.</p>  <p>  In addition to this Daycase Initiative, the NTPF has been working closely with my Department and the HSE to agree an approach to the remaining 2017 allocation.  The HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plans for Inpatient/Daycase procedures and Outpatient appointments to reduce the number of patients waiting more than 15 months by the end of October.  The Inpatient/Day case Plan is being developed in conjunction with the NTPF's approach to the utilisation of its remaining &euro;10m funding for patient treatment in 2017. </p>  <p>  The HSE has now submitted Draft Waiting List Action Plans for Inpatient Daycases and Scoliosis.  My Department is currently reviewing and evaluating these plans and engagement is ongoing with the HSE and the NTPF towards the finalisation of the former.  The Outpatients Plan has been significantly progressed and I expect that it will be submitted shortly.</p>  <p>  In 2016 the only Initiative delivered by the NTPF was the Endoscopy Waiting List Initiative which targeted the longest waiters.  The NTPF has indicated to me that none of the patients that were facilitated under this Initiative were on public waiting lists in Donegal.</p>  <p>  In 2016, I requested, the HSE to submit an Action Plan to reduce by 50% the number of patients waiting over 18 months or over for an inpatient or daycase procedure.  Funding was made available to the HSE under the Winter Initiative to support the delivery of the Action Plan.  With regard to the patients in County Donegal who were treated under the Action Plan, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-28a.1069.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800073#WRR06400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 404 to 407, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. </p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  </p>  <p>  Gardasil is the HPV vaccine used in Ireland in the context of the HSE schools immunisation programme.  In Ireland more than 660,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and almost 250,000 girls have been vaccinated against HPV.  Over 205 million doses of the HPV vaccine Gardasil have been distributed worldwide, either as part of national immunisation programmes or by private doctors.  Gardasil is currently used in over 25 European countries, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. </p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to the differing medical needs of this group.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses. </p>  <p>  It is important to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of vaccines, and to increase the uptake rates of all vaccines in the State&rsquo;s immunisation programmes.  The scientific evidence is clear and misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.</p>  <p>  The focus for the HPV programme in 2017 is to counter the misinformation in relation to the safety of the HPV vaccine, and to increase the uptake rate in girls as part of the schools immunisation programme.  The benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh the known side effects.  The safety of these vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and will take into account any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available.   I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

In order to respond to surges in ED demand, under the Framework, hospital managers may, in consultation with the relevant clinical leads, review and cancel non-urgent planned electives, where appropriate.  This allows both beds and staff to be redeployed to alleviate pressure in the ED.</p>  <p>  The HSE intends to undertake a review of the Escalation Framework in the coming months to ensure its effectiveness.

Venesection for the treatment of Haemochromatosis is not considered a routine service under the GMS contract.  Consultation fees charged by GPs outside the terms of the GMS or GP Visit Card contracts are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and their patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.</p>  <p>  The IBTS has been running a Haemochromatosis clinic in the Stillorgan Blood Donation Clinic since 2007 and sees approximately 600 patients annually.  In this clinic the IBTS only accepts Hereditary Haemochromatosis (HH) patients who are eligible to donate blood.  In 2013 and 2014, the IBTS commenced provision of a programme for HH patients in their D&rsquo;Olier St (Dublin) and St Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital (Cork) clinics, respectively.  The Clinics provide phlebotomy at no cost to the patient with a prescription from their treating clinician.  The phlebotomy would be performed, regardless of whether the patient wanted to have their unit converted to a donation.  The IBTS is examining a number of other models of service delivery, and is currently developing a paper on these various models to see how this can be addressed.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the ongoing review of the GMS and other publicly funded contracts involving GPs, and that the next phase of discussions to progress this work is underway.  The aim is to develop a new modern GP services contract which will incorporate a range of standard and enhanced services to be delivered.  I expect that the issue of therapeutic venesection services for patients with Haemochromatosis will be considered in the context of the overall GP contract review process.</p></reply>

Under the risk equalisation scheme, credits are paid to insurers for their older and sicker members.  These credits are funded directly by stamp duty levies on all health insurance contracts written.  The scheme redistributes funds between insurers to meet some of the additional costs of insuring older and sicker members.  The scheme is self-funding and exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State.</p>  <p>  From 1 April 2017 the age-related credits paid to insurers in respect of older people will increase to help to maintain the existing level of support for community rating.  Increasing the amount of age-based credits provided under the scheme requires changes in the stamp duty levy.  The levy will therefore increase by approximately 10% on all products written from 1 April onwards.  It is important to note that increasing the levy does not automatically increase costs across the market.  All of the monies collected are paid back to insurers in the form of credits.

This facilitated the export of meat which was unfit for human consumption.  21 Brazilian establishments are concerned.  Most of them produce for the domestic market; 4 of them have approval for meat export to the EU.</p>  <p>  My Department is closely monitoring this case through the Embassy in Brasilia which is in direct contact with the Brazilian authorities and through the European Commission.  It is the Commission which is responsible for the approval of Third Countries for export of meat into the EU on behalf of Member States.  The relevant Commissioner with responsibility for this area, Commissioner Andriukaitis, is currently in Brazil for discussions with the Brazilian authorities on this issue.</p>  <p>  On 19 March the Brazilian authorities (MAPA) confirmed that they had been informed of the Federal Police Operation on 17 March.  Based on information received, they suspended certification from the 4 establishments under investigation which were approved for export to the EU.</p>  <p>  On 20 March the Commission requested information on all exports to the EU from the 4 establishments since 1 January 2017, and asked the Brazilian authorities to recall any consignments which were in transit.  The Commission also suggested the suspension of certification from any other establishments approved for export to the EU, pending the outcome of a full investigation.  On 21 March I wrote to Commissioner Andriukaitis, supporting the suggestion to suspend certification from all other establishments approved for export to the EU.</p>  <p>  Food safety is a shared responsibility between national and EU authorities.  Food business operators in the EU also carry out their own quality and safety checks in line with their responsibilities to ensure that their products are safe.</p>  <p>  My Department carries out controls on imports at Border Inspection Posts ( BIPs).  The EU imposes strict hygiene and safety controls on imports of food, in particular on animal products for which documentary, identity and physical checks are compulsory for meat products imports.  These are implemented here in Ireland by veterinary staff from this Department at the BIPs.  Checks on all Brazilian product are now being intensified in light of current developments, and will include microbiological testing.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this matter is being treated and dealt with in the most serious and appropriate manner by the EU.</p></reply>

The Bill itself does not apply the specific conditions.  Therefore, other parallel associated measures will be required to ensure that conditions in place for Irish sea-fishing boats are appropriately applied to Northern Ireland boats fishing under the Voisinage arrangements.  The process of identifying which conditions may need to be legislated for is under way.  The conditions will include such restrictions as currently apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  When the necessary measures have been identified, the most appropriate mechanisms for applying them to Northern Ireland boats will be determined.  The objective will be for these measures to come into effect at the same time as commencement order for the Bill.  Together, the Bill and the associated measures will re-establish the status quo for fishing access that existed under the Voisinage arrangements before the Supreme Court's judgment on 27 October.  The only difference will be that the Voisinage arrangements will be provided for within a legislative framework.  The access arrangements for Northern Ireland boats will not change as a result of this Bill, Northern Ireland boats will simply regain fishing access they have had for decades under the Voisinage arrangements in the zero to six nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State.  They will also continue to be subject to the same measures that apply to Irish-registered fishing boats.</p>  <p>  Fishing industry representatives have been briefed on the Bill and the associated measures at recent meetings with my Department.  I have also exchanged correspondence with fishing industry representatives and with deputies who made representations on behalf of concerned fishermen.  I would reiterate that the purpose of the Bill is not to change long-standing fishing access arrangements but to take account of the Court&rsquo;s judgment and provide for arrangements that existed prior to 27 October 2016 to be reinstated within a legislative framework.  Access continues to be accommodated for Irish sea-fishing boats to fish within the Northern Ireland 0 to 6 nautical mile zone.</p></reply>

Only ships approved by DAFM can load cattle for export from Ireland.  These ships undergo a detailed joint inspection by both independent marine inspectors and my Department's veterinary inspectors.</p>  <p>  Cattle being exported are monitored by my Department&rsquo;s veterinary inspectors during the prescribed isolation period.  The loading of cattle is also supervised by officials of my Department and the animals are inspected and certified as regards health status and fitness for travel.  Under the relevant legislation, the transporters must ensure that adequate feed and water is provided for the entire duration of the journey, which includes the loading process.  While on the truck, regulation 1/2005 applies, with an onus on the transporter to make contingency arrangements in the event of unforeseen delay.  This contingency could involve bringing the cattle back to the holding of origin and unloading them in the case of unforeseen delay in relation to loading on to a vessel.</p>  <p>  Cattle on board a livestock ship departing from Ireland are typically bedded and penned in conditions very similar to cattle in any feedlot or cattle shed.  In general, on the occasion of a first shipment to a new destination, a veterinary practitioner accompanies the shipment.  For example, at the time of the first shipment to Turkey at end of September 2016, a private veterinary practitioner accompanied the load from Ireland to Turkey and the unloading of the cattle was monitored by a veterinary inspector from my Department who reported that the cattle were well rested, were in good condition and were fed following landing.  </p>  <p>  To date the feedback as regards the welfare, quality and health of the Irish cattle that have been exported has been very positive.  The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to promote and maintain an environment in which live exports can continue in both an economic and sustainable manner, with due regard for the welfare of all animals exported.</p></reply>

It is vitally important for the CAP to continue its market orientation and to evolve in a way that supports the achievement of European strategic objectives.  </p>  <p>  The Maltese Presidency identified six priorities, which emerged from previous discussions, and which informed our discussion at March Council.  The priorities are &ndash; building resilience, responding to environmental challenges, investing in rural viability and vitality, ensuring generational renewal, maintaining a market orientation and strengthening farmers&rsquo; position while simplification remains an over-arching principle for the future CAP.</p>  <p>  These priorities are largely consistent with what I and my Department view as the key challenges ahead.  In my view the over-riding priority must be to support the sustainable intensification of food production to meet the requirements of a growing population while simultaneously meeting our environmental and climate change obligations.  I believe this can be done by sharpening the focus on outcomes and by reducing the regulatory and audit burdens on Member States and farmers, as they implement measures to achieve these outcomes.  Innovation and the application of new technologies will play a critical role in this effort.</p>  <p>  The recent market difficulties experienced by farmers, demonstrated the need to build farmers resilience in the face of market volatility.  Modern and innovative measures to counteract these difficulties such as hedging arrangements, futures markets and fixed price contracts are areas worth considering and developing.  The direct payments system provides stability and certainty to farmers in the face of market volatility and should continue to be a key component of the future CAP. </p>  <p>  I am very supportive of efforts to encourage generational renewal as we have an ageing farmer population not unlike other Member States and the need to adopt new and innovative technologies as well as more sustainable methods of production will be paramount in the future.</p>  <p>  In terms of addressing these priorities, I think a more holistic approach is needed.  For example, in the case of sustainable intensification, Member States need to be able to identify objectives &ndash; such as the production of more food in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way &ndash; and then be allowed to implement measures which will enable them to achieve those objectives.</p>  <p>  As regards CAP simplification, this remains an ongoing priority for us, given its capacity to reduce the administrative burden on farmers and national administrations.  We are continuing to monitor the effectiveness of simplification and would like to see it go further, particularly in respect of the removal of guidelines and interpretations of regulations that have the effect of increasing the administrative burden.</p></reply>

These included the provision of direct aid  to  farmers, the voluntary production reduction scheme and the &euro;11 million in funding that facilitated the creation of a &euro;150 million low interest loan fund for farmers. </p>  <p>  At the same time, I have at all times stressed the need to take a longer-term view in addressing price volatility.  While there is no single silver bullet existing measures need to be added to through adoption of new innovations, not just by Member States or the Commission, but also by industry. </p>  <p>  With specific reference to futures markets, which are used successfully in other regional dairy markets such as the United States and New Zealand, the recent report of the Agriculture Markets Task Force to Commissioner Hogan noted that such instruments certainly had a role to play but were underdeveloped in the EU dairy sector compared to, for instance, the cereals sector. </p>  <p>  It must be noted that such initiatives typically have a long lead in time to gain industry and stakeholder acceptance as a viable way to mitigate volatility and that the driving force behind any such futures market development in the EU and Ireland must be industry-led. </p>  <p>  I have facilitated discussion on such an intiative at the dairy forum and I am aware of some exploratory work under way in Ireland on the creation of a dairy price index and I would encourage industry players to continue with this important work.  </p></reply>

The suggested amendments are not specific to the UK and would not bind third countries to comply with the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>  <p>  The UK could, of course, if it so chose, decide to retain the CFP in its own domestic legislation.  </p>  <p>  Ensuring that sustainable fishing is maintained by all parties following the UK's departure from the EU is of the utmost importance and I will work closely with all parties to achieve that objective. </p>  <p>  In that context, I have recently held a series of meetings with key fisheries Ministers and am coordinating a like minded group of 8 Member States to ensure that fisheries remains a key priority in the negotiations to come.  Protecting existing shares will be a top priority for that group.  As both I and An Taoiseach have stated before, we intend to ensure that fisheries remains high on the Brexit agenda in the EU and that Ireland obtains the best possible outcome from the negotiations.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.  This Scheme is significant in this regard, providing farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, which will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;25 million includes &euro;11 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo;.  It was this exceptional aid package which facilitated the Scheme from an EU State Aid perspective, and additional funding is not possible under this particular arrangement.  Other sectors, such as tillage and horticulture, were facilitated by national funding under the &lsquo;de minimis&rsquo; State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank and they will report on progress to the SBCI on a regular basis.  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, information is due to be provided shortly and it will be made available as soon as possible.  However all of the banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme.  There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down. </p>  <p>  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I hope that the commercial banks will respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.  I plan to meet with the Chief Executives of the banks shortly to discuss this and other issues relating access to finance in the agri-food sector.</p></reply>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the lead Department for these regulations.</p>  <p>  The 2008 FSAI report provided a &ldquo;scientific opinion on the food safety implications most likely to be associated with land-spreading organic agricultural, municipal and industrial materials on agricultural land used for food production in Ireland against the background of current practices&rdquo;.  Use of dog faeces from dog breeding establishments was not part of landspread practices at that time so was not considered in the report; and it is understood that any current usage is minimal.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has responsibility in conjunction with local authorities for the regulation of dog breeding establishments under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.</p>  <p>  My Department works in close collaboration with the FSAI in the administration of EU and national regulatory requirements relating to food safety.  Official controls on primary production of horticultural produce include an assessment of measures in place by the food business operator to control contamination arising from the soil including the hazards presented by faeces in organic waste.  The Department&rsquo;s  inspectors are cognisant  of the recommendations set out by the FSAI in their 2008 report on land-spreading and in their 2016 publication on Fresh Produce Safety.  Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, requires food business operators to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with any substance (including organic fertilisers/animal manure) intended to be, or expected to be, incorporated into a food and make this information available to the competent authority on demand.  This traceability check on organic fertiliser inputs is conducted as part of my Department&rsquo;s official controls.</p></reply>

All submissions are currently being evaluated. </p>  <p>  To support transparency in this process, it is intended that all views received on the Consultation Document and/or any clarification provided will be publicly made available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Following the closure of the formal consultation process, any meeting that may be held with stakeholders will be open to all interested stakeholders that have engaged in the public consultation.</p></reply>

Experience of this scheme has been that there is very high demand for the available funds and these are generally close to fully committed.  However, some approved projects do not draw down the funds awarded to them for a variety of business reasons.

The ANC scheme replaces the previous Disadvantaged Areas Scheme/Less Favoured Areas Scheme.  The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date has been based on a range of socio-economic factors.  From 2018 eligible areas must instead be designated using a set list of bio-physical criteria.  In cases where a Member State does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis. </p><p>The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are:</p><p>- Low temperature</p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.  Department officials have also been in contact with the Joint Research Centre  and DG Agri in the EU Commission in relation to technical issues arising.</p><p>Over the coming months this analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel be subjected to a refinement process.  </p><p>In parallel to the above process, the Programme for a Partnership Government sets out the commitment to increase the budget for the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme by &euro;25m in Budget 2018.</p></reply>

Instead of this being done from the top down, a more consultative and farmer-led approach is being tested. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, this meant recruiting a dedicated project team capable of delivering the new scheme at the local level and to this end my Department invited tenders from interested parties late last year.  The closing date for this was 24 January 2017 and following evaluation of the submissions, my Department has selected its preferred bidder.  At the present time, the process is in standstill in accordance with procurement law.  When all elements of the procurement process have been completed,  the necessary contracts can be signed and work will then commence on developing the new scheme in consultation with all the relevant stakeholders, including the farmers concerned.  Once this stage has been completed, the process of recruiting farmers into the new scheme will commence.</p>  <p>  While there is still a lot of work to be done, I do anticipate that the first farmers will join the scheme later this year and that the first payment will include 2017.  However, unlike other schemes,  the new hen harrier scheme will not be tied to the calendar year, and this provides for greater flexibility in payment.  At this point I cannot say when the first payments will actually issue, as that process is one to be decided by the project team when they are ultimately appointed. </p></reply>

One of the Department's priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit, is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally, especially for the meat and dairy sectors.  Indeed this principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise 2025.  We have achieved significant successes in recent years in conjunction with the various stakeholders to increase the number of markets to which we enjoy access.</p>  <p>  In terms of beef market access, 2016 saw the extension of our beef market access to the USA to include Beef Intended for Grinding (BIFG) as well as the opening of the Canadian, New Zealand and Israeli beef markets.  Significant steps were also taken in terms of beef market access to China, South Korea and Vietnam in conjunction with the Trade Mission there.  2017 has already seen the re-opening of the Egyptian market to Irish beef and we expect that beef exports may commence soon.  It has also seen the extension of our beef market access to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to include a range of minced and processed beef products, as part of my Trade Mission there. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working on expanding market access for sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry and cooked meats across a range of markets.  For example, for sheepmeat, the market in Iran opened in 2016.  It is also working to simplify certification procedures in a number of markets to which we already have access. </p>  <p>  In relation to dairy, Irish dairy products have a highly rated and hard earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets over the world.  My Department, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, are playing a key role in building the market for Irish dairy.  In 2016 Ireland exported dairy products to over 130 countries.  Against the backdrop of our efforts to significantly increase dairy output and grow the sector, export market diversification is of the upmost importance, and this is particularly true in the context of a post-Brexit scenario. </p>  <p>  The meat market access work involves staff across the Department, including veterinary services, laboratory staff, inspectorate staff, International Trade Division and a wide range of other divisions, in completing market access questionnaires, facilitating incoming inspection visits, diplomatic meetings, agreeing export health certificates etc.  All of this interconnected work facilitates the accessing of new markets.  The unit also works very closely with external stakeholders such as Bord Bia, the industry, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its Embassies abroad. </p>  <p>  However, despite the significant successes achieved to date, I am reviewing the Department's approach to market access at present and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on this in the near future. </p></reply>

In 2016 Ireland exported almost &euro;120 million or over 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat to China, making it the second largest destination for exports after the United Kingdom.  China accounted for 27% of our pigmeat exports in volume terms in 2016. </p>  <p>  As regards beef, getting market access is a major priority for the Department at present.  The Chinese lifted the BSE ban on beef from Ireland in 2015, making Ireland the first EU Member State to make this progress, and this was followed by a systems audit visit conducted by the General Administration of Quality Supervision Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) in January 2016.  As part of the Ministerial Trade Mission to China in September 2016 there was a political meeting with the Chinese AQSIQ Minister and he agreed to expedite consideration of the report of that inspection visit.  This report was received in November and replied to in December.  Following on from the positive outcome to that audit visit the next stages will be the agreement of a protocol and an export health certificate with the Chinese authorities.  This is under active consideration at present by officials from both sides.  Once that stage is complete Irish beef establishments will need to be approved to export to China and this normally involves an individual plant inspection visit conducted by the Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA).  Both the Department and the Irish Embassy in Beijing have been very active on the outstanding issues on beef and are satisfied with the progress made to date.</p>  <p>  As regards sheepmeat, my Department completed a sheepmeat questionnaire in 2014, which was submitted by Minister Coveney during a trade mission that year.  However, we are advised by the Chinese authorities that it is only possible to make progress on one species at a time.  Once market access for beef is achieved, we will seek to progress further our market access for sheepmeat.</p></reply>

A certificate was originally agreed before 2000 but has been amended since then.  A number of meat establishments are approved to produce pigmeat for export to South Korea and in 2016 exports of around &euro;11 million, or 5,000 tonnes, took place.  My Department also hosted a successful pigmeat and dairy re-inspection visit from Korean officials from both the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (QIA) and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) during 2016. </p><p>As regards beef, market access to South Korea is a high priority for the market access unit.  My Department has completed a number of detailed questionnaires for the South Korean authorities over the years.  We also received a visit from an inspection team from QIA in May 2016, who carried out a systems audit on our controls on beef production.  The visit went well and they are finalising  their report at present.  Once their report is completed it would be signed off in Korea by both internal and external professional/technical advisory members before being brought to their Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MAFRA), of which QIA is part. </p><p>The approval process for South Korea is complex and there are a number of stages to complete, many of which take place in South Korea.  However, we are satisfied that we are making significant progress.  </p><p>As regards sheepmeat market access, we have not yet commenced the process with the South Korean authorities as this has not been identified as a high priority by the industry.  For example in 2015, according to the OECD, sheepmeat consumption in South Korea was only 0.2 kg <i>per capita</i>compared to 9.6 kg <i>per capita</i>for beef and 28.4 kg <i>per capita</i>for pigmeat.</p></reply>

In 2016 exports of &euro;25.4 million, or 6,360 tonnes, took place which made the USA the second largest Third Country destination for pigmeat exports after China.</p>  <p>  As regards beef, we received a visit from the Food Safety Inspection  Service (FSIS) in 2014 which was followed by the lifting of the BSE ban in 2015.  Therefore Ireland was the first EU Member State to get beef access to the USA, which is a testament to the high regard in which Irish beef is held.  A total of 8 Irish plants have now been approved for the export of beef and exports of some 2,400 tonnes took place in 2016, which is an increase of 114% on the 2015 levels according to US customs data. </p>  <p>  In July 2016 DAFM received approval to send BIFG (Beef Intended for Grinding) to the USA.  This will enhance our ability to export beef to the US, where a very significant demand exists for beef that will be minced and turned into beef burgers.  My Department is working with some plants that are interested in exporting non-intact beef, or BIFG to the US.  Beef plants that wish to be approved to export manufacturing beef to the US must implement in full the criteria agreed with the US before this trade may commence.  My Department is currently working with the interested plants on these procedures.</p>  <p>  As regards sheepmeat, we are awaiting the publication of a small ruminant rule on TSEs by the USDA, lifting the ban on EU sheepmeat, before we can make further progress on this issue.  However, in anticipation of the lifting of this ban, in August 2016 my Department submitted a detailed questionnaire, or Self Reporting Tool (SRT) on sheepmeat to the USDA.  The Department has also raised the issue bilaterally with US officials and remains keen to try and progress this dossier.</p></reply>

In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  The Directive requires that biofuels must meet strict sustainability criteria to qualify for support and to be counted towards renewable energy targets.</p>  <p>  In September 2015, the European Commission adopted Directive (EU) 2015/1513, also known as the Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC) Directive, which amends certain provisions in the Renewable Energy Directive relating to biofuels.</p>  <p>  One such amendment in the Directive limits to 7% the amount of energy that Member States can count towards their 2020 renewable energy targets in transport from crop based biofuels whose use could lead to Indirect Land-Use Change.  The Directive also contains incentives to encourage the development of advanced biofuels that do not affect food production.  The ILUC Directive will be transposed into Irish legislation by September 2017.</p>  <p>  In November 2016, the European Commission published a proposal for a new Renewables Directive that envisages an overall European Union renewable energy target of at least 27% in 2030.  It is proposed in the draft Directive that the cap of 7% relating to crop based biofuels will be progressively reduced in the period after 2020 to 3.8% in 2030.  The draft Directive also proposes continuing incentives for advanced biofuels and the electrification of transport.</p></reply>

The SSC estimate the number of salmon likely to return to each river in the next fishing season based on an average of the data over the most recent five years.  The use of a five year average ensures that a "good" or "bad" year in terms of salmon returns does not disproportionately impact assessments and that ephemeral incongruity is avoided in data sets and subsequent scientific advice.</p>  <p>  In contemplation of the 2017 fishing year, three scientific assessments of the salmon stock status on the river Slaney were undertaken.  These assessments were based on recent fish counter data, rod catch data, and catchment-wide electro-fishing data.  All three assessments indicate that the Slaney is not meeting its individual conservation limits for both one sea winter or multi sea winter salmon stocks.</p>  <p>  The scientific salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland are considered best practice internationally, with many other countries moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) that it deploys a significant protection and conservation resource into the river Slaney catchment including day and night surveillance operations, boat, kayak and foot patrols and monitoring of water quality.</p>  <p>  The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced following a Government decision in 2006 to cease the commercial salmon mixed stock fishery for conservation reasons.  Under this scheme, &euro;25 million was targeted at commercial salmon fishermen, who were active in the fishery at the time, and funding was provided to fishermen for them to permanently cease fishing and diversify into new activity.  In addition, &euro;5 million was provided for community based initiatives in areas affected by the cessation of fishing.  It closed for applications on 31st December 2007 and was ceased, with all funds expended, in 2008.  There are currently no plans to revisit such a scheme.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding.</p>  <p>  In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.</p>  <p>  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 as the primary means through which Ireland would meet the transport target and is the principal support for the uptake of biofuels in Ireland.  The scheme works by obligating road transport fuel suppliers to bring increasing amounts of biofuel to the transport fuel market.  An increase to the obligation rate in the scheme took effect from 1 January 2017 when the rate increased from 6% to 8% by volume.  I intend to publish a consultation later this year to examine the potential for further phased increases to the Biofuels Obligation Scheme.  These increases to the biofuels obligation rate on a phased basis will create increasing demand for biofuels and opportunities for their production.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have established and are co-chairing a Low Emissions Vehicles (LEV) Task Force involving relevant Government Departments and agencies.  The work of the task force has been divided into two phases.  The first phase is focusing solely on Electric Vehicles with the second phase focusing on all other alternative fuels.</p>  <p>  The Task Force will report on an interim basis to Government on the first phase by June 2017.</p></reply>

While I am precluded, under the 1992 Act, from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the EPA of its functions in specific cases, I am happy to respond in relation to the general issues raised by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Firstly, although the EPA, like many State Bodies, has immunity from liability for civil damages, it is important to clarify that it is not immune from prosecution, as it is answerable and accountable before the Irish Courts.  More generally, it is also accountable to the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the independent review of the Agency did not conclude that there was "maladministration" at the EPA.  The reference to maladministration referred to in the Deputy's question relates to a discussion in the independent review as to how any such alleged maladministration might be managed were it to occur.  The document does not refer to any actual allegation of maladministration against the EPA and thus there is no basis for an investigation as suggested in the question.</p>  <p>  The independent review of the EPA ultimately concluded that the EPA has the independence to arrive at informed and objective decisions, and to undertake objective assessment and reporting on the state of the environment.  This independence is one of its key strengths and is well provided for in existing legislation, including in relation to the enforcement of licences and consents in individual cases.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the EPA will continue to meet its statutory mandate to safeguard and improve Ireland&rsquo;s environment by working with all its stakeholders, and that its procedures in regard to issuing licenses, and maintaining compliance with the licenses, are robust, so that the public in general can have confidence that the environment and human health are being properly safeguarded.</p></reply>

The emission limits are set to ensure an appropriate balance which allows the operation of a facility to apply good practice, and to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.</p>  <p>  Since the European Environment Agency Report was published in 2012, monitoring undertaken by the EPA, which is available on the EPA's website www.epa.ie, has shown that emissions from all such facilities are substantively in compliance with the emission levels prescribed in their IED license.</p>  <p>  Where there are alleged breaches to the license conditions, the EPA has the necessary powers to prosecute the owners of the facility.  The EPA , although under the remit of my Department, operates independently of my Department in activities such as licencing and enforcement, including prosecutions.  It obtains its own legal advice as necessary as to whether a prosecution is warranted or otherwise.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services;</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>There are c.27,500 premises in County Carlow, of which approximately 10,500 are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.  The remaining 17,000 premises are located in the commercial blue area and will be served by commercial operators.</p><p>All the townlands which the Deputy refers to fall within Amber areas on the map, with the exception of Kernanstown, which is predominantly Blue and so to be covered by commercial operators.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.</p><p>In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.  The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link: .</p><p>Minister Humphreys has established two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  Since July, there has been significant progress made in discussions with the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.</p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.</p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country including County Carlow.</p></reply>

In order for Ireland to effectively and equitably contribute to the EU emissions reduction commitments, an ambitious low-carbon development strategy is being developed.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) and the Department of Agriculture to prepare our National Mitigation Plan.  Transport will, of course, have to play a significant role in the national mitigation effort.  Aviation emissions are specifically excluded from the mitigation effort and from the Paris Agreement on the basis of a commitment made in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to implement a global scheme to offset and reduce emissions from international aviation.</p>  <p>  An historic agreement was reached at the 39th International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly in September 2016 to implement such a global scheme.  Ireland, along with the other 43 states of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) has made a commitment to take part in the ICAO global offsetting scheme from its first phase from 2021.  In the meantime, Ireland is also a participant in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) which has included aviation since 2012.  Ireland is also committed to pursuing a number of measures specifically for aviation under the Action Plan for Aviation Emissions Reduction 2015-2019.</p>  <p>  While international aviation accounts for less than 2% of all global emissions, it is recognised that the growth of demand for air travel worldwide requires a comprehensive approach to address CO2 emissions.  In that context ICAO is promoting a basket of measures to address emissions which includes ensuring progress on aircraft technology, operational improvements in the air and on the ground at airports and in encouraging the development and deployment of low-carbon sustainable alternative fuels. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with ICAO and within the EU, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, to ensure that initiatives at national and European level contribute effectively to the international effort to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goals.</p></reply>

Transport will, of course, play a significant role on the national mitigation effort.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) and the Department of Agriculture to prepare the draft National Mitigation Plan which is now available for extensive before being submitted to Government for final approval later this year.  While aviation emissions are not part of the Paris Agreement, in September 2016 the 39th International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly reached a historic agreement on a global scheme to offset and reduce emissions from international aviation.  Ireland, along with the other 43 states of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) made a commitment to take part in the scheme from its first phase from 2021.  Ireland is also committed to pursuing a number measures specifically for aviation under the Action Plan for Aviation Emissions Reduction 2015-2019.</p><p>Regarding Dublin Airport, I understand that daa manages and reduces its own direct emissions in line with its obligations under the various National and EU energy efficiency and carbon regulations.  As reported in the 2016 Annual Report on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance published by SEAI, daa is already well on track to meet the public sector target of 33% energy efficiency improvement by 2020. </p><p>daa also actively participates in the voluntary ACI Europe Airport Carbon Accreditation Programme and has consistently achieved reductions in carbon emissions since entering the programme in 2009.  daa also operates its combustion plant as permitted under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for stationary sources.  I am satisfied that daa takes its national and international commitments regarding climate change seriously.</p><p>daa holds statutory responsibility for the management, operation and development of Dublin Airport.  In line with this responsibility, it must ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to facilitate the development of the airport and that there is sufficient capacity to meet existing and future demand.  The Deputy will be fully aware of the vital importance of air connectivity to Ireland as an island economy and therefore the development of the much needed additional runway capacity at Dublin is of huge importance to Ireland.  </p><p>I have welcomed daa's decision to develop this critical piece of airport infrastructure, which will ensure Ireland's International connectivity into the future and is in line with the National Aviation Policy published in 2015.</p></reply>

The Policy has been developed in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Guidance for public bodies on the performance of their functions under the Protected Disclosures Act.  A member of staff may make an internal disclosure to  their direct line manager or to more senior member of staff, as appropriate, where they have a genuine concern relating to suspected wrongdoing or danger affecting any of the Department's activities.  Alternatively a member of staff may seek to make an external disclosure if certain conditions are met as outlined in the Department's Policy.  All disclosures are subject to an initial assessment by the recipient of the disclosure following guidelines set out in the Policy.</p>  <p>   Where it is determined that the disclosure falls within scope and it is necessary to carry out an investigation, a full investigation must be immediately initiated.  Depending on the nature of the disclosure, the recipient of a disclosure may decide to conduct the investigation themselves or may consider referring to a more senior official for investigation.  The Policy provides for periodic feedback in relation to the matters disclosed including when consideration of the disclosure is complete.  If a discloser is not satisfied with the outcome he/she may seek a review.  One review is available under the terms of the Policy and the decision of that review is deemed to be final.</p>  <p>  I am advised that no Protected Disclosures have been received from staff of the Department but a number of disclosures have been made since the enactment of the legislation in 2014 to Ministers in respect of matters relating to agencies of the Department or other external issues.  Where the Department is of the view that the matter disclosed falls within the Act and requires a full investigation, it shall decide who is best placed to carry out the investigation and the matter should be referred to that person, including if appropriate to a relevant prescribed person or to an appropriate agency (such as an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na).

This approach is set out in the Public Financial Procedures at C8 Section 11 whereby the general rule is that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which, if it arose would fall wholly and directly on public funds.  This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as to materially disturb the financial position of the year, so that it is cheaper in the long term for the Exchequer to "carry its own insurance".</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency is designated as the State Claims Agency (SCA) when performing the claims and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.

The National Aviation Policy for Ireland, 2015, committed my Department to the commissioning of a high-level strategic capacity review of State airports in 2018.  Given the fact that current passenger growth trends are anticipated to continue, and in light of the decision by daa to proceed with the construction of the North Runway Project, I requested that the process of commissioning this capacity review be brought forward.</p>  <p>  The review will examine the key elements of airport and airside capacity, namely terminal capacity, apron stands and the runway and taxiway system as well as landside capacity, (particularly the impacts of capacity needs on the wider transport network).  It will also review the long term capacity requirements to meet forecasted passenger throughput at the three State airports to 2050 and identify priorities for infrastructure provision.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Review will take account of the wider Government objectives and policies for enterprise, tourism and balanced regional development in Ireland, including the goals and objectives set out in the National Planning Framework, Ireland 2040, launched recently by my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p>  <p>  In the case of Dublin Airport only, I have asked that the study assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of the operation of Terminal 3 by the existing airport operator in comparison with being operated on an independent basis.</p>  <p>  Tenders for consultants to undertake the review have been received and are being assessed in the Department at present.  It is expected that the contract to undertake the review will be awarded to the preferred bidder shortly with the review expected to be completed later this year.</p></reply>

Such requests must be made to the Commission before the end of February each year and form part of the Commission&rsquo;s work programme. </p>  <p>  Requests in this context were made to the Commission in 2016 in order to obtain a better understanding of the impact of the national minimum wage on younger people and to establish the reasons behind the preponderance of women on the national minimum wage.  The Commission reported on these matters in October 2016.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s work programme for 2017 is already in place and as well as its core work on examining the appropriate minimum wage for 2018, the Commission is also reviewing the board and lodging rates that are provided for in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  It is due to report on this issue by the end of April.  The Commission has also been asked to review the length of time spent on the national minimum wage and whether it is a stepping stone to higher pay for people as they get older and the extent to which lack of progression links to poverty/welfare traps. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue of CEO pay, I am aware of the Irish Congress of Trade Union&rsquo;s report Because We&rsquo;re Worth It The Truth about CEO Pay in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In general, executive remuneration is a private contractual matter between a company&rsquo;s board of directors and the CEO.  As such it would not fall within the remit of the Low Pay Commission and I have no plans to make any changes in this regard.</p>  <p>  The UK Government, in its recent Green Paper on Corporate Governance Reform sets out proposals for the mandatory publishing of pay ratios.  The Irish Stock Exchange requires listed Irish companies to conform to the UK Corporate Governance Code and its Irish Corporate Governance annex on a principle of comply or explain.</p>  <p>  Additionally, at EU level, a new Shareholder Rights Directive is expected to be adopted shortly.  The Directive&rsquo;s ambition is to ensure greater transparency and encourage greater shareholder involvement in the long term investments of public limited companies.  An aspect of this approach is to ensure greater shareholder involvement in determining the pay of the company directors.</p></reply>

An aspect of this approach is to ensure greater shareholder involvement in determining the pay of the company directors.   </p>  <p>  Legislation governing the operation of the Low Pay Commission requires that the Commission, when making a recommendation each year on the appropriate rate of the National Minimum Wage, "shall have regard to changes in income distribution during the relevant period".   The Commission has addressed the question of income distribution in its annual reports. </p>  <p>  In 2016, the Commission noted in its report that while pre-tax and transfer distribution of income in Ireland is one of the most unequal in the OECD, our tax and transfer system, on the other hand, is progressive, resulting in a distribution of income post-tax and transfers at around the OECD average.  It is interesting to note that wage inequality declined substantially from the level of the mid-1990s to the early 2000s before rising during the Celtic Tiger period.  The recession however saw a reduction in wage inequality which counterbalanced the increase observed during the boom period.  There is some evidence that inequality may be increasing again during the recovery but it is important to exercise caution against drawing strong inferences from only one available year of recovery.</p></reply>

In today&rsquo;s increasingly inter-connected world, geopolitical, technological and financial forces that happen elsewhere have implications for Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth.  Competition to attract FDI has intensified significantly, and all of FDI is hard won. </p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 was published just over a year ago and sets a roadmap for longer term enterprise development.  Our vision for Ireland is to be the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all.  Enterprise 2025 sets out actions that focus on building competitive advantage, on ensuring a supportive business environment, and on realising a significant uplift in the performance of enterprises based here in terms of innovation, export potential and productivity, and on attracting further investment.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s new trade and investment strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World, was published in March of this year and reflects, therefore, the current thinking and ambition of the entire range of Government departments and agencies involved in trade-related activities.  The Strategy reflects the importance of protecting and intensifying our well-established markets in the UK and the US while simultaneously diversifying into other global markets.  This is reflected in targets such as:</p>  <p>  - 80% of export growth in indigenous enterprises to reach markets outside the UK </p>  <p>  - increase exports to the Eurozone by 50% </p>  <p>  - at least 60% of growth in food and drink exports to occur in Asia, North America and Africa. </p>  <p>  The policies we have put in place ensure we are anticipatory and responsive and build resilience in our enterprise base.  The evidence shows that these policies are working.</p>  <p>  According to the latest CSO data, there were over 2 million people at work at the end of 2016 and we are well on track to achieve our ambition to have 2.18 people in employment by 2020.  There are almost 209,000 additional people at work since the start of the Action Plan for Jobs Process in 2012.  In the twelve months to the end of 2016, an additional 65,100 are at work.  The enterprise development agencies recorded another successful year in 2016 in terms of supporting job creation and investment.  The unemployment rate is now down to below 7.0%, from over 15.1% in 2012.  Ireland is now ranked 7th overall in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook &ndash; a significant improvement from 24th in 2011. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the very positive progress that has been made in recent years, I have already secured additional resources to allow us build on the momentum that has been generated. </p>  <p>  While I remain confident, therefore, of the continued relevance of Enterprise 2025 in terms of its focus on resilience of the enterprise base, it is nonetheless timely to review its progress and identify any additional actions or changes necessary in light of more recent global challenges.  I have asked my officials to report to me later this year.</p></reply>

By delivering on the full potential of the Plans, the aim is to deliver a total of 246,000 jobs by 2020. </p><p>Achieving these ambitious targets at regional level will require a renewed focus on collaborative efforts to build on regional strengths, assets and areas of competitive advantage to develop the attractive and competitive environments for business to start, grow and succeed on international markets and to attract inward investment.  <table><tr><th>Region</th><th>Published   Regional APJ targets 2015- 2020</th></tr><tr><td>North East/North West</td><td>28,000</td></tr><tr><td>Midland</td><td>14,000</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>66,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>23,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td>State Total</td><td>246,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs is stimulating job creation across the region,  by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds awarded through Enterprise Ireland, to support regional enterprise projects. </p><p>The North East/North West Plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 jobs across Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020.  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism. </p><p>There has been a substantial improvement in the North East and North West regions since the commencement of the National Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, with an additional 23,000 in employment in Q4 2016 compared to Q1 2012.  Moreover, there are now almost 6,800 more people in work in the region since the launch of the Regional Action Plan initiative.</p><p>The unemployment rate in the region has fallen from 10.2% in Q1 2015 to 8.0% at present, compared to the national rate of 6.7%.</p><p>IDA, Enterprise Ireland (EI), and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are making a significant contribution to employment in Sligo and Leitrim.</p><p>There are currently 27 multinational companies employing over 2,700 people in counties Sligo and Leitrim.</p><p>EI companies currently support 1,546 and 922 jobs in Sligo and Leitrim respectively.  EI job announcements in 2016 in the North West included LotusWorks (50 jobs in Sligo) and VistaMed (200 jobs in Leitrim).</p><p>The Sligo and Leitrim LEOs are fully engaged in supporting the micro-enterprise and small business sectors in their areas to create and sustain jobs.  In 2016, the number of jobs that were created by micro-enterprises that had been supported by LEO Sligo and LEO Leitrim were 38 and 44 respectively.</p><p>My Department is providing additional funds through the agencies out to 2020.

This provided a valuable opportunity to hear from companies and stakeholders about the impact of Brexit on their businesses</p>  <p>  My Department is also funding a number of research projects to:</p>  <p>  - improve our understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit;</p>  <p>  - provide data on the extent and concentration of cross border trade, including information on this trade by product and firm types and barriers to trade;</p>  <p>  - to examine the implications for the most exposed enterprise sectors - in terms of trading and economic relationships - of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union.</p>  <p>  In terms of my Agencies, Enterprise Ireland has been systematically engaging with its 1,500 clients that export to the UK.  EI will continue to provide continued supports to its client companies who now directly employ over 201,000 jobs across the country. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is constantly engaged with clients across its entire portfolio and in the months leading up to the UK referendum it engaged with clients and prospective clients in relation to the potential impact of Brexit.  The IDA has a Team involved in strategic scenario planning, which continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of the referendum results in the UK. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices are a key resource for the micro and small business sector, particularly in the regions.  I have obtained an additional Capital allocation of &euro;4m for Local Enterprise Development in 2017, which will be used to implement a series of Brexit-related measures in the LEOs. </p>  <p>  IDA, EI, and the LEOs are making a significant contribution to employment in Sligo and Leitrim.</p>  <p>  There are currently 27 multinational companies employing over 2,700 people in these counties.</p>  <p>  EI companies currently support 1,546 and 922 jobs in Sligo and Leitrim respectively.  EI job announcements in 2016 in the North West included LotusWorks (50 jobs in Sligo) and VistaMed (200 jobs in Leitrim).</p>  <p>  The Sligo and Leitrim LEOs are fully engaged in supporting the micro-enterprise and small business sectors in their areas to create and sustain jobs.  In 2016, the number of jobs that were created by micro-enterprises that had been supported by LEO Sligo and LEO Leitrim were 38 and 44 respectively. </p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative is a concrete example of the targeted approach we are undertaking to boost regional employment.  While the Regions will benefit from our wider Brexit responses, the implications of the Brexit vote and the challenges and opportunities that the decision pose for specific Regions has been discussed at the meetings of the Implementation Committees for the Regional Action Plan for Jobs that have taken place since the June decision. </p>  <p>  The North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs is stimulating job creation across the region, by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds awarded through Enterprise Ireland, to support regional enterprise projects.  The Plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 jobs across Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020.  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism. </p>  <p>  I will continue to visit the regions and meet with stakeholders to ensure that plans are being implemented in every region, including the Border region.</p></reply>

The role it plays in sustaining employment in Ireland is well-documented, with approximately one out of every five private sector jobs here directly or indirectly resulting from FDI.  Last year saw the highest ever level of employment in IDA Ireland client companies, with 199,877 people now employed in companies supported by the Agency, including 2,703 jobs across 27 IDA Ireland client companies in Sligo and Leitrim. </p>  <p>  The wider strategy for increasing employment in the North West region, which includes Sligo and Leitrim, is the Regional Action Plan for the North East/North West.  This plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 new jobs across Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020.  I am pleased that there has been strong progress made to date towards that objective, with 5,600 more people in employment across the region since the start of 2015.</p></reply>

The Competition Act 2002 as amended closely reflects these provisions in Irish law and this legal situation will continue after Brexit.</p>  <p>  More generally, the European Commission is empowered by the Treaty to apply these rules and has a number of investigative powers (e.g. inspection at business and non-business premises, written requests for information, etc.) and may impose fines on undertakings which violate the EU rules. It works closely with Member States where anti-competitive practices are alleged to be taking place cross border or in more than one Member State to bring about an end to such practices. </p>  <p>  The purpose of competition law is to protect and benefit consumers.  Greater competition provides good value for consumers, stimulates business, and enhances the economy as a whole while anti-competitive behaviour results in consumers paying higher prices without any extra benefits and undermines the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  The greatest harm comes from cartel type activity including price-fixing, which deprives consumers of the benefits of vigorous competition on price, service and innovation. Such activity is characterised by hidden costs and higher prices.</p>  <p>  It is too early to say what impact Brexit may have on the UK&rsquo;s regulatory and competition environment. Provisions on State Aids and competition policy are a common feature of EU Free Trade Agreements to ensure any aid granted by authorities to private entities does not distort competition.  The terms of any future free trade agreement, including state aid rules, would be a matter for the EU 27 and the UK to agree as part of any negotiation.</p>  <p>  From a regional perspective, the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 includes a series of collaborative actions aimed at stimulating regional growth, including the progression, monitoring and support of the eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, which aims to realise the national Action Plan&rsquo;s regional employment targets.</p>  <p>  The North East/North West Plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 jobs across Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020.

These negotiations are likely to be complex and multifaceted.  This Government will seek, during that process, to highlight our unique economic ties with Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is clear that the cross-border market on the island is a particularly important one for SMEs, with nearly two thirds of Northern Ireland small firm exports going South and one sixth of Ireland&rsquo;s small firm exports going North.  Inter Trade Ireland has undertaken a series of events for SMEs to raise awareness of Brexit issues, with more planned.  They have published information material for their companies setting out key challenges posed by Brexit.  Further initiatives by Inter Trade Ireland on this issue are also being developed for roll out later this year. </p>  <p>  I am engaged strongly with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to ensure that Irish jobs are maintained and created with a particular focus on regional targets.  Enterprise Ireland is working with its 1,500 clients who export to the UK, looking at the individual challenges faced by companies in every county in Ireland and also on a sectoral level, as some sectors are more exposed than others.  Enterprise Ireland also consistently works with client companies focussing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets. </p>  <p>  I am in constant communication with these agencies, and chair a Brexit Coordination Group, which includes the senior management of my Department and the CEOs of the agencies.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing dialogue with interested parties, I organised an important stakeholder engagement event on the 30th of January, in Carrick on Shannon, Co Leitrim to hear the views of stakeholders, both directly and through representative bodies. </p>  <p>  The Government has just published a new Trade Strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World which supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification - promoting diversified export markets in light of the potential impacts of Brexit is a key priority for my Department.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  The programme of trade missions and trade events for 2017 includes a substantive focus on the EU and third country markets.  In 2017 we have 42 Minister led trade missions to existing and emerging markets.  These have been reorientated to reflect an increased focus on EU markets. </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements with third Countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.</p></reply>

Workers may also make protected disclosures to persons outside the Department, and to a number of Offices and Agencies of the Department, which are prescribed under the Act.  These arrangements are included in the Department&rsquo;s Protected Disclosures policy.</p>  <p>  Where a protected disclosure is made, the concern raised is treated seriously and investigated where it is considered appropriate.  Every appropriate step is taken to safeguard the identity of the person raising the concern and they are kept fully apprised of how the issue is being addressed, including the outcome of any investigation.  The person raising the concern is not disadvantaged in any way for having made the disclosure, even if no wrongdoing is identified, providing the concern was based on a reasonable belief.  The Protected Disclosures policy provides that the person receiving a disclosure should notify, in confidence, the Secretary General, the appropriate Head of Division, the HR manager and the Head of the Management Support Unit.</p>  <p>  Depending on the nature of the disclosure, the recipient of an allegation may decide to conduct an initial examination of the issue themselves, or may refer the matter to another colleague who is more suited to investigate the alleged wrongdoing.  If, on preliminary examination, there appears to be prima facie substance to the allegation, the matter may be the subject of a full investigation or may be referred to an outside body, including An Garda Siochana.</p>  <p>  Since the Protected Disclosure&rsquo;s Act 2014 came into force, there have been 7 disclosures to my Department.  In two of these cases the matters raised related to the business of my Department and were assigned for investigation by persons outside the Department, with relevant expertise.  In other situations the matters raised were not the subject of areas of responsibility of my Department and had been also separately raised with the relevant Government Department.  In all cases the person making the disclosure was kept informed of the decision by my Department in relation to their disclosure.</p></reply>

Specifically, Section 18 of that Act, provides that employees with a certain number of hours (that number may be zero) as well as employees on an as-and-when contracts or hybrid contracts  are entitled to compensation if the employer does not require them to work in a given week when they required to be available for work.  They are entitled to compensation amounting to 25% of the time they were required to be available or 15 hours pay, whichever is the lesser.  </p>  <p>  It is important to the note that the University of Limerick study on the prevalence of zero hours contracts in Ireland found that zero hours contracts are not common in this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister Mitchell O'Connor, and I intend to bring forward proposals in this area for consideration by Government.  In this respect, work has progressed well on developing a policy response to the Programme for Government commitment to address the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious employment.  We intend to include protections aimed particularly at low-paid, more vulnerable workers.  Our proposals will address the issue of employees on low hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week but whose contracts do not reflect the reality of their hours worked.

Where a company fails to meet that deadline, it loses the audit exemption.  </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the withdrawal of the audit exemption for failure to file on time, the rate of compliance with filing deadlines has increased from 13% to 90%.  This increase in compliance was one of the reasons why the Company Law Review Group recommended no change to the loss of the audit exemption when it reviewed the provision in 2011.  </p>  <p>  Section 343 introduced the option for a company to apply to the District Court or the High Court for an extension to its annual return date.  In 2016, 1,201 such applications were made to the District Court and 29 to the High Court.  Of these, 957 applications were granted with the remainder refused, withdrawn or adjourned. </p>  <p>  The option to apply to the courts replaced what had been an administrative scheme where a company could apply to the Registrar of Companies for an extension. Under that administrative scheme, a consequence of any extension was the loss of the audit exemption. </p>  <p>  Head 167 of the General Scheme of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill proposes to reinstate the situation whereby a company loses the audit exemption if it is granted an extension to its annual return date. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme has been submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting into a Bill.

In addition, Quarterly Reports providing full details of the latest Credit Guarantee Scheme performance are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The new Credit Guarantee Scheme 2017, recently launched by my colleague, Mr Pat Breen, T.D., Minister for Employment and Small Business, will be available shortly to our SMEs.  It is my belief that we will see a significant uptake in demand, given that the new Scheme will</p><p>- permit me as Minister to take a higher level of risk on finance provided to SMEs;</p><p>- enable new financial providers to take part, and;</p><p>- allow for the provision of finance to SMEs via products other than bank loans, namely agreements on credit facilities, asset credit facilities and invoice financing facilities.</p><p>A. <b><i>Credit Guarantee Scheme Sanctioned by County</i></b><table><tr><th><div><b>County</b></div></th><th><div><b>2014</b></div></th><th><div><b>2015</b></div></th><th><div><b>2016</b></div></th><th><div><b>Total</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>&euro;

There is provision within the SCP grant scheme to allocate up to &euro;5,000 of this funding annually towards counselling supports should a) such supports be deemed essential to support young people at risk of early school leaving or young people out of school and b) should no other counselling supports be accessible or available to meet these counselling needs. </p>  <p>  Kilkenny SCP is currently preparing its SCP plan for the 2017/2018 school year.  The plan is due to be submitted by April 21st 2017 and should reflect the planned programme of interventions agreed by Kilkenny SCP to meet the needs of the young people being supported by the SCP programme.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 made no provision for increases in the School Completion Programme Budget so the funding available for the 2017/2018 school year remains the same as that available for the current school year. </p>  <p>  While the School Completion Programme allows some funding to be allocated towards counselling supports where such supports are required for students being supported by the SCP programme and such supports are not available from any other source, the School Completion Programme is not designed to meet wider counselling needs in schools. </p>  <p>  Tusla supports and funds child counselling through the Agency&rsquo;s Family Support Services funding.  In 2016 funding solely for child counselling was increased under this scheme by &euro;154,000 to &euro;680,000. In particular child counselling funding to 70 Family Resource Centres around Ireland was increased to &euro;242,000. </p>  <p>  Tusla is the primary funder of Barnardos Childrens Bereavement Service.  This funding was increased by &euro;20,000 in 2016, total funding to the service is now &euro;154,600.  Tusla is also committed to the funding of Rainbows Ireland, which provides group based support to children dealing with loss following parental separation /divorce or a death.  The Rainbows programme is currently delivered in over 250 schools and community based centres around the country.  Funding in 2016 was increased by &euro;15,000 to &euro;250,000 annually.</p></reply>

Of the children in care, 93% were in foster care nationally; there were 4,102 (66%) children in general foster care, 1,715 (27%) in relative care and 316 (5%) children were in a residential care placement.  </p><p>The breakdown by age for children in foster care in 2016 is not available as yet, however Tusla has provided a breakdown of provisional figures for 2015.  At the end of December 2015 there were 4,110 children in foster care nationally.  The breakdown by ages as requested by the Deputy is as follows:<table><tr><th><div>Age category</div></th><th><div>Number of children in foster care</div></th></tr><tr><td>Under 12 years of age</td><td><div>2,497</div></td></tr><tr><td>12 - 15 years of age</td><td><div>1,117</div></td></tr><tr><td>16 - 17 years of age</td><td><div>496</div></td></tr></table></p><p>I can advise that the most recent figures available in relation to the number of children in care with a disability are to the end of September 2016.  At that time, 5,906 children were in general foster care nationally.  Of these, 523 (9%) had been diagnosed by a Clinical Specialist as having a moderate to severe disability.  The Census 2011 results published by the Central Statistics report that nationally the percentage of children aged 14 years and under with a disability was 5.4%.</p><p>I have placed a high priority on addressing the number of children who are without an allocated social worker.  I secured additional funding for this purpose in 2017, and Tusla is now in the second year of a 3-year plan to ensure that a social worker is allocated to all children and young people who need one.  </p><p>The number of children without an allocated social worker at the end of 2016 was 5,413 representing a reduction of 19% (1,305) over the course of the year.  Cases to be allocated to a social worker include children known to Tusla whose social worker is no longer available to them, as well as children waiting to be allocated for the first time.  All unallocated cases are assessed and prioritised according to risk.  Tusla has indicated that there were 453 children in care awaiting the allocation of a social worker at the end of 2016.  Tusla advises that children in care with a disability are a priority.</p></reply>

To this end,  I would like to acknowledge the dedication of colleagues in Tusla to improving the lives of children and families that access our services.  </p><p>As you will be aware, Tusla has received exchequer funding of &euro;713m in 2017.  This increase of &euro;37m over 2016 funding will allow Tusla to proceed with its ambitious on-going programme of service reform and transformation which is underway, with a particular focus on governance; risk management; health and safety; and quality assurance and service monitoring to support the delivery of front line services, all of which I fully support.  </p><p>As Tusla matures, it continues to evaluate management and staff skills mix with a view to service enhancement, including reviewing the roles of family support workers; social care workers in the community; and administrative structures to support the delivery of more efficient and more cost-effective services.  Part of this evaluation also includes looking at enhanced job roles, increasing multi-disciplinary team-working in an effort to alleviate pressure; redesigning tasks; and promoting greater efficiency in working.  I particularly welcome Tusla's focus in 2017 on leadership development and supporting the forthcoming workforce development plan through learning and development and succession planning.  </p><p>The establishment of Tusla's in-house recruitment function,<i>Tusla Recruit, </i>marked an important milestone in building its internal capacity to recruit and I trust that recruitment timelines will improve further during 2017 with the development of Tusla's in-house Central Vetting Bureau in Q1, 2017.  Tusla continues to have ambitious recruitment targets, expecting to recruit an additional 369 whole time equivalent posts across a range of professional, para-professional and business support functions before the end of 2017.  </p><p>However, a concern for me is that despite Tusla&rsquo;s increased efforts during 2016, including an intensive graduate recruitment campaign in Ireland (including Norther Ireland), recruitment  of social workers continued to be very challenging, requiring significant recruitment activity to achieve a modest increase in whole time equivalent and compensate for normal worker attrition rates with which Tusla must contend.  It must also be noted that only 250 social work graduates are produced annually in Ireland and Tusla is competing with the rest of the market for this limited pool and so it is likely that the recruitment of social workers will continue to be difficult for the coming years.  </p><p>However I am confident that Tusla's continued focus on recruitment of appropriate staff in 2017 will support the improving trend with regard to unallocated cases and continue to improve the supports available to front line services. </p></reply>

This was processed in accordance with the agreed protocols ensuring due process, fairness and equity.  I understand that the outcome was that AIM Level 7 support was not found to be critical to enable this child to participate meaningfully in the ECCE programme.  However Level 4 support was recommended.  </p>  <p>  Following a feedback phone call with a member of the Pobal team, a review request was submitted by the applicant.  This review application and information submitted with it were all reviewed in line with the AIM Review Policy and the original decision was upheld, with Level 4 support again recommended.  Level 4 support provides expert educational advice and support from an Early Years Specialist.  The Early Years Specialist can, where necessary, visit the service and develop an individual Access and Inclusion Plan for the child within the pre-school setting, in conjunction with the parent and provider.  </p>  <p>  A further review can be requested if there is new information in relation to the application or a change of circumstances for either the child or the service.</p></reply>

The key principle of the Children Act 2001 is that detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort.  When children come into contact with the criminal justice system there is an emphasis on the promotion of community based options in the first instance.  The Irish Youth Justice Service oversees a significant investment in community based programmes to divert young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, approximately &euro;17m has been allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.  </p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to the Irish Youth Justice Service for services relating to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus (Oberstown) and the Bail Supervision Scheme which has recently been established on a pilot basis.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that the Bail Supervision Scheme will provide more therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  The service will provide a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.  It is envisioned that such a scheme will offer greater options to the courts in the knowledge that closer monitoring will take place through interaction with the young people, their families and communities.  </p>  <p>  If a child is remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in Oberstown, a range of rehabilitative supports is offered to every child as part of an overall programme, which focuses on the child&rsquo;s individual needs and provides the framework for each child&rsquo;s individual journey through detention.  The focus is on developing supportive relationships with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation.  </p>  <p>  Oberstown has a service level agreement with certain organisations including advocacy services to children and young people in detention, and those in aftercare, their families and communities to support their full potential.  </p>  <p>  The wide range of rehabilitation, education and support services provided and supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service are detailed in the Tackling Youth Crime: Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018, and a progress report covering the period 2014 to 2015, published recently, is available on my Department's website. </p></reply>

Youth Caf&eacute;s offer young people a safe, alcohol and drug free space, for recreation, non-formal learning and youth activities and they make an important contribution to facilities for young people at local level.  Recent research undertaken by my Department indicates that there are now more than 150 youth caf&eacute;s throughout the country.  In the main, these have been developed, over the years, by local communities with the support of different funding sources.  Between 2011 and 2013, capital funding provided to my Department supported the development and fit-out of new youth caf&eacute; proposals. </p>  <p>  My Department does not provide current funding to organisations such as the Funky Fish Youth Caf&eacute;, referred to in the Deputy's question.  I am advised that the Funky Fish Youth Caf&eacute; was allocated once-off funding of &euro;5,773 in 2011.  However, it is open to them to make an application for funding under the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which supports youth work activities at a local level.  Under this scheme, grants are made available to 1,600 youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, almost &euro;1.2m has been allocated to this scheme, a 10% increase over 2016.  The scheme, which is open to new entrants, will be advertised locally and applications for funding are invited by almost all ETBs from local groups in their respective areas.  Cork ETB will be advertising the scheme on their website over the coming months. </p></reply>

While the number of hours of childcare subsidised per week will be capped at a maximum of 40 (or 15 for families in which a parent is neither engaged in work nor in study), it is not intended that there will be any minimum number of hours of childcare for participation in the scheme.  Parents availing of subsidies under the scheme &ndash; whether for part-time or for full-time childcare &ndash; will be subsidised on the basis of the number of hours of childcare per week, with the subsidy per hour determined by the age of the child and the family income.  Maximum subsidy rates, for families with the lowest incomes, will range from &euro;3.76 per hour for school-age childcare to &euro;5.11 per hour for children between 6 and 12 months.  Recognising the importance of flexibility to families, arrangements in terms of the numbers of hours per day or days per week of childcare that is used will be a matter for parents to decide, depending on the childcare options available to them locally.  </p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.  </p>  <p>  The universal element of the Scheme will be available to all families with children between the age of 6 months and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the free pre-school programme if later than 36 months).  The targeted element of the scheme will involve a progressive system of income-related subsidies for parents with children between 6 months and 15 years, with eligibility based on net parental income.  A family may receive either the universal or the targeted subsidy per eligible child, but not both. The subsidy provided will be whichever of the universal and targeted payment is most favourable to a family.  </p></reply>

This requirement came into effect for newly-registering services on 30 June 2016 and for existing services on 31 December 2016.  The requirement to have a qualification to provide care and education to young children has been extensively welcomed.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the impact that this change is having on community settings &ndash; from my own experience, from a number of meetings I have had with providers and representative groups, and from the Early Years Forum I established to ensure that providers&rsquo; voices are heard.  I am acutely aware of the challenge that has been posed to services.  </p>  <p>  In preparation for the implementation of the Regulations, my Department commissioned Childcare Committees Ireland (CCI) to investigate the impact of the new childcare regulations on community childcare providers.  All Community Childcare services around the country were afforded an opportunity to engage with this project during 2016, and detailed analysis has been completed.  </p>  <p>  The CCI work indicated that the vast majority of services would not face financial hardship as a result of changes required under the regulations.  However it did find that some services had come to rely on Community Employment (CE) scheme workers, and I determined that these services should be provided with additional funding until September 2017, to enable them to transition to a more sustainable footing.  Of course, the position of CE scheme workers is only one aspect of the challenge facing community services, and I absolutely recognise that this funding is acutely required in light of these challenges.  </p>  <p>  The sector has taken the initiative in commissioning and completing research highlighting the challenges they face, and I am aware that we need to get the funding model right for these services.  This is a complex issue; and I hope that providers will appreciate that we have had to move to tackle the most urgent issues first, designing a new model of eligibility for families, tackling the CE scheme issue and providing funding for &lsquo;non-contact time&rsquo; for the first time.  This does not mean that I do not recognise the particular challenges being faced by services working in the most disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been working with Pobal and Childcare Committees Ireland to get funding out to services impacted by the change in relation to CE scheme workers; and I understand that contracts to enable payment have now issued to services.  Funds will be disbursed without delay once these contracts are signed. </p>  <p>  Delivering high quality, accessible and affordable childcare is my key goal, and this funding will ensure that every child will be cared for by a qualified professional, and that services can sustain existing levels of provision, while they prepare for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  I will be announcing further information on this new Scheme in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

In this regard, the Deputy might note that Youth Services will receive an additional &euro;5.5m over their 2016 allocation.  As a result, youth services have an overall budget of &euro;60 million in 2017.  This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities.  Over 380,000 children and young people engaged with these services in 2016. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, will receive an additional investment of &euro;37 million in 2017.

A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk.  Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla.  The Children First Act, 2015, once it is fully commenced, will place a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  It is my intention that these provisions will be commenced by the end of 2017.  </p>  <p>  Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  When a child cannot live with their parents and is received into care, it is Tusla policy to place them in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community.  A very small minority of children under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behavioural or other difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability.  The care needs of these children are generally met by directly provided residential services or a privately commissioned service.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has Foster Care Committees in place across the country and regularly seeks to recruit more foster carers.  In addition, Tusla procures and develops residential accommodation to deliver on its annual business plan objectives.  Tusla also procures a range of services from the private sector, including additional foster or residential placements, and such specialist services as are needed to address individual care plans.  Tusla also co-ordinates with the relevant State bodies, accessing supports across a range of areas, including health, psychosocial services and education.  </p>  <p>  Each referral received by the Agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the duty social work team.  It is of note that, at the end of Quarter 3, 2016, Tusla reported that approximately 60% of the referrals received were of a child welfare concern, and the remaining related to child protection concerns.  Tusla refers child welfare concerns to the relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if circumstances change or new information comes to light and there is concern about abuse, the child protection pathway is followed.  </p>  <p>  Tusla provides me with information on a monthly and quarterly basis outlining the increasing demands for their services, and how they are dealing with children awaiting services.  This information provides me with the information needed to assess how well we are supporting vulnerable children.  Also, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), inspects Tusla child welfare and protection services, statutory children&rsquo;s residential care centres and foster care services while Tusla inspects children&rsquo;s residential centres run by the private and voluntary sectors.  </p>  <p>  This valuable and detailed information continues to inform the Department and Tusla in the business planning needed to maintain and further enhance the range of services for the care and protection of children.  Tusla is currently engaged in the second year of a three year recruitment programme to expand the cohort of social workers, social care workers and business support staff.  I have secured additional funding for Tusla to enable this and the current and capital Exchequer funding for Tusla is some &euro;713 million for 2017. </p></reply>

Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  The Agency is obliged to provide care for these children for as long as their welfare requires it. </p>  <p>  Children First National Guidance (2011) gives advice for notifying Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of situations where abuse is suspected.  A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Gardai and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk.  Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla.  The Children First Act, 2015, once it is fully commenced, will place a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  It is my intention that these provisions will be commenced by the end of 2017. </p>  <p>  If a child is taken into care, their needs are given priority.  A social worker is assigned to a child placed in State care and has a duty to prepare and regularly review the care plan for the child.  Intrinsic to this process is ensuring that the wishes of the child are listened to, and if appropriate, Tusla may assist them in establishing residency.</p>  <p>  Unaccompanied asylum seeking children are placed in care and have their needs assessed, and are allocated a social worker.  </p>  <p>  Children who, with their parents, live in Direct Provision, are provided with welfare supports as required.  Tusla seconded an experienced social worker to the Department of Justice and Equality to liaise directly between Direct Provision and Tusla services.</p></reply>

This covers child welfare protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE area and it is intended to extend it to Galway, Limerick and Cork this year. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the State only intervenes in family life in exceptional cases.  Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parent or guardian.  If there is a specific child protection concern, Tusla can investigate and take the child into care if necessary.  The reporting of any such concerns to Tusla is governed by Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  Where there are no welfare or protection concerns, Tusla&rsquo;s role is to provide family support, where this is required.</p>  <p>  Tusla is providing additional supports to assist families in emergency accommodation.  It funds child support workers for this purpose and has also appointed a Homelessness Liaison Officer.  My own Department is providing free childcare for homeless children in the Dublin area for up to 25 hours a week.  Our Family Resource Centres (FRCs) are working with people who are experiencing homelessness.  Many FRCs have already developed a local response to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include for example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services.  Tusla will be developing a reporting mechanism this year to record the extent of homeless work in the Family Resource Centres.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance the Educational Welfare Office (EWO) offers a number of supports to children and their families.  The DRHE has also arranged Leap cards for homeless families in Dublin to facilitate family days out and for school journeys.</p>  <p>  It is of the utmost importance that we minimise the impact of homelessness on children and offer families comprehensive supportive measures, while ultimately working toward eradicating homelessness in Ireland.</p></reply>

Social work duty teams keep high priority cases under review by regularly checking to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary will reprioritise the case.  </p><p>There were 11,732 referrals to Tusla during Q3, 2016 which was (4%) fewer than Q2, 2016.  97% of referrals (Q3, 2016) had a preliminary enquiry carried out.  Approximately 68% of preliminary enquiries were completed within 24 hours of receipt of the referral and 41% of referrals required an initial assessment. </p><p>Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Approximately 60% of referrals to Tusla are of a child welfare concern with the remaining 40% related to child protection concerns.  Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.</p><p>Upon receipt of an <i>appropriate </i>referral, the Duty Social Worker carries out preliminary enquiries, including checking to see if the case is already open or known to child protection services, clarifies the nature of the concern, contacts key professional ie public health nurses or teachers, and records the child and family details.  It is possible that referrals can be closed at this stage or referred to another service (for instance to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services).  If the threshold for a child protection initial assessment is not met but a child has an unmet need then this may be addressed as a child welfare concern by local support services organised through the Local Area Pathways/Meitheal as a Family Support Plan.</p><p>A referral becomes an open case (one per child) when it meets the criteria to need an initial assessment.  It will be given a priority level of high, medium and low, depending on the information available. </p></reply>

Of these, 5,817 (93%) were in foster care and 316 (5%) were in residential care.  Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection, and it is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parent(s)/guardian(s).  Of the 5,817 children in foster care, there were 4,102 (66%) in a general foster care placement and 1,715 (27%) were in care with relatives.  Residential care is the placement of choice for older children who have needs that are best met by this placement type.  In general, residential care is based in domestic style homes, catering for 2 or 3 older children. </p>  <p>  All children in care should have an allocated social worker but it is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker, the cases are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker and are managed by duty social work teams to support the child's needs.  At the end of December 2016, 93% of all children in care had an allocated social worker (6,258/5,805).  All but two children in residential care had an allocated social worker.</p>  <p>  Tusla current has 1,467 WTE social workers and an end of 2017 target of 1,520 WTE.  This target is short of the target set in Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 WTE and reflects the constraints of the social work labour supply.  Funding is in place to address the issue of unallocated cases, however, the recruitment environment for social workers is very challenging.  With only 250 graduating a year it is a very competitive labour market for social workers in Ireland.  Tusla has taken a proactive approach to recruitment and has focussed its attention not only on recruiting social workers in Ireland but also the UK.</p>  <p>  Tusla will continue to be as proactive as possible in the market to close the social work shortfall.  However, Tusla is also focusing on being able to intervene at an early stage of a family difficulty through social care and family supports.  Accordingly, Tusla is prioritising the recruitment of an additional 100 Family Support Practitioners, 166 social care staff and an additional 25 administrative staff to allow social workers to focus on their core work with children and their families. </p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service. </p>  <p>  Since their establishment in 1993, there have been significant developments and improvements in the pay and conditions of military personnel.  The Representative Associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them in line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments.  Officials from my Department continue to work with the Representative Associations in a positive and collaborative process within the C&amp;A Scheme which points to the effectiveness of the scheme for resolving IR issues.  It is open to the Representative Associations to submit claims to the Official side in relation to matters falling within the C&amp;A scheme.  Generally claims relate to pay and conditions, award of allowances etc.  When submitted, these claims are generally the subject of negotiations and where agreement is not reached it is open to both sides to seek the assistance of an adjudicator to settle the matter.</p>  <p>  A number of mechanisms have also been put in place through the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme which provides the Representative Associations with structures and processes, which enable them to make representations and negotiate on behalf of their members.  In addition, a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level.</p>  <p>  I have received representations from PDFORRA seeking to have access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court made available to them, in the event of any future legislative changes being made to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with access to same.  My officials are considering this submission in light of the review being undertaken by the Department of Justice and Equality Working Group on access to the Industrial Relations Structures for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will reply to PDFORRA when the outcome of the current considerations in relation to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to hand.  However, at this point in time I remain satisfied that the current arrangements fully satisfy the requirements in terms of access to appropriate negotiation, conciliation and independent adjudication to address any issues raised by PDFORRA. </p></reply>

His application was assessed by the Board of Assessors (a Judge and two senior Old IRA officers) which was constituted under that Act to assess such applications and service.  Although he had claimed for Easter 1916 service, the Board did not award him service for pension purposes in respect of this period.  He was, however, awarded a Certificate of Military Service for the period 1 April 1920 to 30 September 1923 (including service in the National Army).</p><p>Section 3(6) of the Military Service Pensions Act 1924 provided that the Board of Assessors could at any time re-open their findings at the request of the Minister on the ground that evidence not previously available was now available.  The person in question did subsequently appeal to the then Minister for Defence in 1928 to have his case re-opened but his appeal was unsuccessful. </p><p>The power given to the Board of Assessors to reopen findings was removed by the Military Services Pensions Act 1949.  There is now no statutory provision to re-open the findings of the Board.  The process by which applications and petitions or appeals under the Military Service Pensions Acts were made, investigated and verified was wound up in 1958 and there is no statutory or other mechanism available now by which service can be investigated or verified. </p><p>The 1916 Medal was awarded to persons who were awarded 1916 service under the Military Service Pensions Acts, or to those who did not apply for a pension but who satisfied the Minister that they would have been awarded 1916 service if they had applied under the Acts. </p><p>There are witness statements held in the Military Archives which are stated to be relevant to this case.  I understand these are Witness Statements from the Bureau of Military History.  Decisions regarding the award of medals/pensions are dependent on verification and corroborative evidence of the service involved.  Unfortunately, the &lsquo;Witness Statements&rsquo; which were collected from 1947-1957, were not verified and tested as part of a formal process under the relevant Acts, and therefore they cannot be accepted as evidence of service.</p><p>I should however say that the relevant pension files, which include material relating to his claimed activities in relation to Easter Week 1916, are now publicly available online on the Military Archives website ().  His activities in Easter Week 1916, while not reaching the threshold for a pension and thus a 1916 medal, are a matter of public record.  The Service Medal (1917-1921), with bar, was awarded to the person in question in respect of his service during the 1917-1921 period.</p><p>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to do anything further regarding the issue of a 1916 Medal but I hope this helps to clarify matters. </p><p>In 2016 the State undertook a comprehensive programme of commemorations to mark the centenary year of the 1916 Easter Rising.  The Government was committed to ensuring that 2016 would be a year of rich and diverse activities with the focus on remembering and honouring those who took part in the 1916 Rising.  Throughout 2016 some 45 official events commemorated their contribution and bravery. </p><p>As part of the planning process for these events my Department was assigned responsibility for registering and maintaining the list of relatives of those who took part in the 1916 events who had expressed an interest in attending events to mark the centenary. </p><p>I can confirm that the relatives of the person whose details were supplied by the Deputy did register and were invited to attend events in 2016.</p></reply>

As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels.  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Defence Forces are planning to induct 860 new entrants across all services and competition streams in 2017.   </p>  <p>  A new General Service Recruitment campaign was launched on 23 February 2017, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain the strength of the Defence Forces at 9,500 personnel.  To publicise this recruitment campaign, an Interactive recruitment video was launched on 10 March 2017.  In addition, a Recruitment Roadshow will take place between 23 March 2017 and 4 April 2017.  The Roadshow will visit every Military Barracks in the country and provide an opportunity for potential Recruits to be immersed in a capability display, a virtual reality experience, and receive fitness testing briefs with an opportunity to speak to young soldiers serving today.</p>  <p>  The intake of Cadets into the Permanent Defence Force is normally carried out on an annual basis, taking into consideration the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and the resource envelope allocated to Defence.  The 2017 Cadetship competitions were launched on 22 March 2017.</p>  <p>  Direct Entry Competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled.  A recruitment campaign for the appointment of Direct Entry Naval Service Officers, in the Operations Branch, Marine Engineer Branch and Electrical Engineer Branch of the Naval Service, is currently on-going.</p>  <p>  In relation to promotional vacancies, promotions are ongoing within the Officer ranks in order to fill rank vacancies.  A new NCO promotion competition, to fill vacancies to the ranks of Sergeants and above, has been launched.  Promotions from the Order of Merit Lists from this competition will commence in Q3 2017.  Promotions at Corporal rank take place at formation/service level when vacancies arise within Units and where there are qualified personnel in these Units to fill the appointments.</p>  <p>  It is my intention that targeted recruitment along with promotions , will continue to be carried out within the resource envelope allocated to Defence.</p></reply>

The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs.</p>  <p>  For the current year, Subhead A.5 provides for a budget of &euro;2.15 million of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated for a total of 26,000 Paid Training Mandays for members of the Reserve.  Of this figure, 25,250 Mandays will provide a minimum of seven (7) days annual paid training for all effective members of the Reserve.  This provision also allows for fourteen (14) days paid training for all personnel newly recruited to the Reserve Defence Force (in their first year of induction), and also provides for career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities.  This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the Reserve and the voluntary nature of Reserve training.  The remaining 750 Mandays are allocated to provide for Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RDFRA) business. </p>  <p>  While the minimum provision of paid training days is 7, members of the Reserve may avail of additional paid training days, up to a total of 28 days, in the context of career courses, specialist and other additional training.  Members of the Reserve who wish to undertake additional training beyond the allowance of twenty-eight (28) paid man days may do so with prior written approval from the Department of Defence.  This facility applies to all members of the Reserve Defence Forces irrespective of where they are based.   </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the voluntary nature of Reserve Service, training continues to be organised both in and out of normal working hours and at weekends.  Reserve training is also organised during academic and traditional holiday periods, in order to maximise attendance of Reserve personnel. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the extensive and professional training provided to the Reserve Defence Forces is a key motivating factor which will encourage more people to join it as well as retaining existing personnel.</p></reply>

It also highlights a number of medium and long term strategies in the area of manpower planning.  The White Paper addresses the need to review and develop medium term planning requirements so as to deliver an effective and efficient mix in terms of age profile, skills, competencies and experience, and current policies to support this will be further developed and implemented.  To that end, White Paper projects are currently underway and are being jointly developed by military and civil personnel.</p>  <p>  In addition, the purpose of the recent Defence Forces Climate Survey is to inform consideration of the ongoing human resource and strategic needs of the Defence Forces.  The responses to the issues raised in the Climate Survey resulted in the formulation of an Action Plan which is being led by the Chief of Staff.</p>  <p>  The Government in the White Paper on Defence 2015, committed to a Permanent Defence Force establishment of at least 9,500 serving personnel.  To this end, the Defence Forces have recruited 690 personnel in 2016 and have an overall recruitment target of 850 to 900 personnel across all three services in this current year.  The Defence Forces continue to recruit at cadet, specialist and general service levels for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  Both the General Service and Cadet competitions are currently open and competitions for direct entry watch keepers in the Naval Service will result in inductions shortly.</p>  <p>  The retention of personnel, particularly experienced Pilot Officers in the Air Corps, has been a significant challenge for the Defence Organisation in recent years.  Actions are underway to return a full level of air traffic control services to the Air Corps.  In relation specifically to the resourcing of Air Traffic Controllers, six (6) Air Traffic Services personnel are part-way through their training and a further eight students commenced training on Monday, 27 March 2017.    </p>  <p>  At present there are 3 Cadet Classes, totalling 27 personnel at various stages of Pilot Officer training.  Of the 27, seven (7) are due to qualify as pilots at the end of 2017.  In addition, an Air Corps Pilot Cadetship competition was launched on 22 March 2017, with a planned intake of up to 12 Cadets in the third quarter of this year.  However, it will take some time for cadets, when qualified, to develop their skills and expertise.  It is envisaged that a return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps will be a gradual process and will be governed by the overarching requirements of safety. </p>  <p>  There are a number of wider initiatives in place to address recruitment and retention across the Defence Forces.  One of the key policies supporting personnel retention is the opportunity for extensive personal and professional development offered by the Defence Forces through accredited courses, and the unique features of the military environment.  It is also the case that the extensive professional training they receive makes them very attractive within the private sector.  Additionally, the new Public Service Pay Commission has been tasked with providing objective analysis and advice on the most appropriate pay levels for the public service, including the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Reserve Defence Force, it is anticipated that the next recruitment campaign will commence in the second half of 2017.  Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions two relate specifically to the RDF i.e. attracting recruits from all backgrounds and conducting a skills survey with a view to establishing a Specialist Reserve.</p></reply>

Options available include the donation, or sale by way of public auction which can allow for the refurbishment and reuse of a vessel by a secondary party.  Such uses can include operational restoration for further life as a ship, or for use as a museum.</p><p>Following the decommissioning of <i>LE Aisling</i>, there was a request from Galway City Council for the vessel to be donated to the people of Galway to be used as a floating museum.  In this regard I indicated that I wished to give the matter the fullest consideration and requested Galway City Council to provide a fully costed feasibility study for the use of the former<i>LE Aisling</i>by the Council.  In the absence of the requested proposal I decided that the vessel would be put up for sale by way of public auction and I instructed officials from my Department to proceed with the arrangements for the sale.</p><p>In this context the former <i>LE Aisling</i>was offered for sale by public auction in Cork on Thursday 23 March 2017.  The vessel was sold for the sum of &euro;110,000 to a Dutch shipbroker, and the necessary paperwork is being finalised to allow for the removal of the vessel from the Naval Base in Haulbowline.</p></reply>

The scheme is designed with the specific aim of equipping participants with life and other marketable and certifiable skills which will assist them both in their capacity to participate fully in society as well as their ability to enter the workforce and or to pursue further education for this purpose. </p>  <p>  The scheme is a training programme of ten (10) weeks duration, consisting of five (5) weeks of training delivered by the Defence Forces interspersed with five (5) weeks of educational orientated training by the Education and Training Board.</p>  <p>  The scheme and the programme content have been developed through detailed discussions involving the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of Social Protection and the Dublin and Dun-Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  The Department of Social Protection identifies suitable participants.  Participants retain any Department of Social Protection benefits that they are currently entitled to for the duration of the Scheme.  Participation on the scheme is wholly voluntary for the relevant cohort of jobseekers and there is no penalty applied for non-participation or engagement in the programme.  Participants do not receive any payment from the Department of Defence.  A successful pilot programme was held in Gormanston Camp from Monday 20 June 2016 to 26 August 2016 with 25 participants.  Following an evaluation of the pilot programme and Ministerial approval, the current plan is to run up to 2 iterations of the programme in 2017. </p>  <p>  The first iteration of the programme will commence in Limerick on 22 May 2017.  The Department of Social Protection invited 1,006 persons selected from the Live Register in counties Clare and Limerick aged between 18 and 24 years to attend information sessions about the scheme.  260 persons attended the information sessions held on 16 and 17 January 2017 which were conducted jointly by personnel from the Defence Forces and Department of Social Protection.  There are 30 places on the programme and the selection process is ongoing.</p></reply>
