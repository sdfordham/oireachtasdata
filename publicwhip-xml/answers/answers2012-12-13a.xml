    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-13a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121300059#WRA00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 15 together.</p><p>  Given the very comprehensive and detailed nature of the information requested across a broad range of schemes, I am arranging for it to be provided directly in an appropriate format to the Deputies as soon as possible. </p><p>  The inspections concerned are an inherent requirement deriving from the very significant funding which is drawn down from the EU to support Irish farmers and the rural economy generally.  They must be carried out to a minimum level and specification.  However, in implementing the regime, my Department takes maximum possible account of the realities of farming and of impacts of particular events, such as prevailing weather conditions.  In addition, my Department makes every effort to integrate the various inspections with a view to avoiding more than one visit to a farm.  </p><p>  I will now give an orientation of the regime as it applies under the main schemes.    </p><p>  Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme </p><p>My Department in the context of delivering the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas&#8217; Scheme is required to carry out an annual round of inspections covering both the eligibility of the land declared to draw down payments and also cross compliance   aspects, to ensure compliance with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare. These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually. </p><p>Land eligibility checks must be carried out on at least 5% of applicants. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the farmer and to ensure that any ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes. In order to be eligible to draw down EU funding, it is a requirement that all land eligibility inspections must take place before any payments can issue to any farmer   in the country in a given year.</p><p>  My Department has made every effort to respond to concerns about the impact of ground inspections on farmers and taking advantage of advances in satellite and related technologies, around 75% of these inspections are initially carried out without the need for a farm visit.  In such cases, the information needed is acquired using the technique of remote sensing via satellite.    </p><p>  Cross Compliance Checks</p><p>The rate of inspections for cross-compliance is 1% of applicants to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural Environmental Condition (GAEC) apply. However, 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements while 3% of sheep/goat farmers must be inspected covering 5% of the flock.  It is a recognised principle of the direct aid regime that it serves broader public-good objectives and contributes to the maintenance of the rural environment.  These inspections are thus necessary to verify that these objectives are being met. While Cross Compliance   inspections can be carried out after payment has been made, it is a regulatory requirement that this category of inspection must take place throughout the calendar year to take account of specific requirements at individual Statutory Management Requirement level and also for GAEC requirements.</p><p>  Where non-compliances are determined during inspections, the relevant EU legislation prescribes the range of penalties to be applied.  However, a full appeals process is available.</p><p>  Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS)</p><p>  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue. 75% of the payment can issue once this administrative check including the plan checks are completed. The land details for each farmer are verified through a system called the Cross Check and a further administrative check is carried out on each file which fails this cross check. In addition to the above checks the Control Regulations governing the REPS Scheme state that 5% of the total area based measures must be inspected. A REPS inspection is a check to ensure that the applicant is complying with his/her REPS plan.</p><p>  Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS)</p><p>  Data from all applications submitted under the scheme are recorded electronically and computerised checks are carried out to validate each application.  All validated applications then proceed to be ranked and scored in accordance with the pre determined criteria set out in the scheme documentation after which farmers are notified in writing whether or not they have been admitted to the scheme.  Applicants are also subject to on farm inspections carried out by Inspectors of my Department. A minimum rate of 5% of applications must be inspected each year chosen by a combination of risk analysis and random selections.</p><p>  Suckler Welfare Scheme</p><p>  Inspections are carried out on 3% of all participants in this Scheme annually and penalties are applied where non-compliance with the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme, such as disbudding, castration and weaning requirements, has been identified. Penalties are also applied during routine processing of all herds where Terms and Conditions have not been complied with. As this Scheme is fully funded by the Exchequer, payments made under its remit are not subject to cross compliance or land eligibility penalties.</p><p>  Payments issued under the 2012 Schemes </p><p>As I have said, the inspection regime is necessary to protect the drawdown of the significant funding Ireland receives from the EU in this area and, where appropriate, the Exchequer funding provided.  My Department has a very good record in delivering the inspection regime, while at the same time delivering payments expeditiously to farmers.   For example, to date, 98.5% of all eligible applicants under the Single Payment Schemes have been paid, with a total of &#8364;1.193bn having issued under this scheme. Payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme have issued in over 87,000 cases, amounting to some &#8364;193m<i>.</i> A total of 70% of REPS applicant have been paid 75% of their payment, amounting to &#8364;87.7m.  There are over 14,300 farmers currently participating in AEOS and payments amounting to over &#8364;48.3m have been issued to date in 2012<i>. </i>  In the case of the Suckler Welfare Scheme payments in respect of 2011 born calves commenced at end 2011 and to date payments of &#8364;22.25m have been made to over 30,300 farmers. </p><p>  In summary the importance of the Direct Payment Schemes to both the farmers who receive these payments and also the wider rural economy is evident. Annually these payments amount to some &#8364;1.8 billion.  Therefore it is incumbent on my Department to ensure that the EU regulatory control environment is comprehensively implemented to protect these payments, allow the payments to be made quickly and to avoid substantial EU disallowances.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-13a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121300060#WRB00400"><p>In the first instance I would like to set the record straight in that no decision was made to abolish the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, which, in fact, is due to end on 31 December 2012. This Scheme was a five-year Scheme for beef animals born in herds owned by eligible participants during the period, which commenced on 1 January 2008 and ending on 31 December 2012. In that regard, I have made funding of &euro;10 million available in 2013 to continue to make aid payments on calves born in 2012.  The primary objectives of the Scheme are summarised as follows:</p><p>- Enhance welfare standards for animals produced from the suckler cow herd.</p><p>- Improve husbandry standards at weaning time leading to reduced illness and mortality and enhanced health of the National herd.</p><p>- Provide education and knowledge building among farmers on best practice in suckler herd health and welfare.</p><p>- Improve the genetic quality of the national suckler herd.</p><p>- Improve the competitiveness of the Irish beef industry and the quality of the beef  produced.</p><p>  A Value for Money Audit, which was undertaken in accordance with the Department of Finance Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative, established that the Scheme has largely achieved these objectives. The 34,000 participants, who continued in the Scheme over its five-year duration, are fully aware that following best practice in the breeding, animal health/welfare aspects and rearing of suckler calves leads to better prices and demand at weanling sale time.</p><p>  In addition, I have allocated &euro;10 million in 2013, financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds for a new support programme for suckler beef farmers to participate in a new Beef Data Programme. This programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers.</p><p>  In total, I have made provision for the payment of aid amounting to &euro;25 million to the beef sector in 2013. I announced the establishment of a Beef Technology Adoption Programme in 2012, which will be retained in 2013. This Programme is built on the lessons of the Dairy Efficiency Programme and provided a &euro;5 million financial stimulus to encourage, through the medium of professionally facilitated discussion groups, and a task oriented approach, the adoption of a more focussed commercial approach to beef farming.</p><p>  In relation to the information sought by the Deputy, I would like to clarify that farmers, who are participating in the Suckler Cow Welfare, are not required to submit an application under the Scheme on an annual basis. The vast majority of farmers submitted an application at the commencement of the Scheme in 2008. It was only necessary for new entrants to suckler production to submit an application form when they commenced participating in the Scheme since 2008. Furthermore, payment cannot be made on all eligible calves until the participant has registered all of the events, including birth, pre and post-weaning information, required under the Scheme. Payment will not become due on many calves until they are weaned in 2013 and only when all of the measures are registered by the participants. In addition, payment will not be made on 2012 weaned calves where the measures have yet to be registered by the participant. However, I have arranged for the data in the format sought to be made available to the Deputy for calves born in 2011.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-13a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121300060#WRB00700"><p>I recently met with the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle O'Neill MLA, at a joint North South Ministerial Council where we shared information on actions taken in both jurisdictions in relation to <i>Chalara fraxinea</i>.  My colleague Minister of State Shane McEntee TD, has also met with Minister O'Neill and has been in regular direct contact to ensure that the legislation that both jurisdictions introduced was compatible in relation to both our treatment of plant imports and our treatment of wood imports, and also to continue to brief each other on the situation with the disease north and south of the border.</p><p>  Officials from my Department are also in regular direct contact with officials from the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and have met on a number of occasions recently to co-ordinate an all island response to prevent the spread of ash dieback disease as the island of Ireland maintains a harmonised plant health regime under the EU Plant Health Directive.  There is a very good working relationship and strong dialogue between our officials and those dealing with this disease in Great Britain.</p><p>  My officials are in regular contact with their EU counterparts in relation to ash dieback disease, primarily through the EU Standing Committee on Plant Health.  At the most recent meeting on 22/23 November 2012 Ireland made a presentation to the Commission and the Member States outlining the situation concerning <i>Chalara fraxinea</i> in Ireland and the national protective measures which have been introduced to combat the disease.  Department staff and Teagasc are also members of a European research cooperation group called 'Fraxback' that exchange scientific information concerning the Ash dieback disease.</p><p>  These contacts are especially important after my Department announced yesterday a significant stepping up of its eradication measures based on the results of its ongoing Chalara survey. The interim results from the major winter survey currently being undertaken has confirmed further positive samples for the presence of Chalara.  This brings the number of positive cases to 22, including 15 in young plantations, 6 in horticultural nurseries and 1 planted ornamentally in a garden.  There have now been incidents of the disease in forest plantations in Counties Leitrim, Meath, Tipperary, Kilkenny, Waterford, Carlow, Kildare, Laois, Longford and Galway.</p><p>To address the threat to our ash woodlands, there will be a major eradication programme on sites where there are ash trees from confirmed positive imported consignments. My Department will supervise the destruction and re-establishment of these sites. A re-establishment grant will be made available to the owners of private plantations which are part of the Department&#8217;s current afforestation programme. Ash plants from the infected batches supplied to other sites will also be destroyed.</p><p>  The intensive winter surveys will continue until a full picture has been obtained and my Department will continue to review the situation and take the necessary actions to deal with the disease. The situation in other European countries is being monitored also.</p></reply>

This year, the arrangements for 2013 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 18th to 20th December.  The levels of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and the quotas for Ireland will be determined at that meeting following negotiations with Member States and the EU Commission.  The Fisheries Council will also decide on the fishing effort, which determines days spent at sea, available for the Irish fleet in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast for 2013.</p><p>  The process of preparing for the Council is now well under way with the publication of the European Commission's detailed proposals for TACs and quotas of key stocks of interest to Ireland in October. The proposal covers stocks which are not subject to third party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.</p><p>  Since the publication of the proposal I have conducted a number of bi-laterals with the EU Commission, a number of Member States and the Irish fishing industry. I have also formally commented on the Commission proposal in advance of negotiations.  I have had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal through the preparation of a Sea Fisheries Sustainability Impact Assessment which is provided for in the Programme for Government.  To facilitate and inform these deliberations, I initiated an open consultation process whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2013. From November 2nd an online web portal on www.fishingnet.ie was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.</p><p>  In addition, I convened a meeting of stakeholders on the 15th of November which gave a further opportunity to key stakeholders to outline their position on the many aspects of the Proposal.  The Marine Institute and BIM have also undertaken an evaluation of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal which is contained in the Sea Fisheries Sustainability Impact Assessment.</p><p>  The Impact Assessment acknowledges that while many stocks in which the Irish fleet have an interest are not in a healthy biological state, there has been an improvement in 2012 on the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators.</p><p>  The Commission subsequently published their Proposal for a Council Regulation fixing for 2013 the fishing opportunities available in EU waters and, to EU vessels, in certain non-EU waters for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks which are subject to international negotiations or agreements in November.</p><p>  The non agreement at the Coastal States talks on mackerel, blue whiting and atlanto scandian herring aligned to the inconclusive second round of bilateral negotiations between the EU and Norway, now means that some stocks where Ireland have an interest including mackerel , horse mackerel, blue whiting, ling &amp; saithe will be subject to provisional quotas at the December Council.</p><p>  Coastal States negotiations on blue whiting and atlanto scandian herring will resume on December 14th, in London.

The current CFP is under review and will not now be completed during the Cypriot Presidency and accordingly will fall for delivery during the Irish Presidency of the EU.</p><p>  My overarching goal for the new CFP is for a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver a sustainable and eco centred fisheries landscape for future generations.</p><p>  Ireland's priorities include maintaining the Hague preferences, long term management of stocks, reducing and eliminating discards where possible, rebuilding stocks to Maximum Sustainable Yield and a non-mandatory system of Transferable Fishing Concessions.</p><p>  The new CFP will be agreed between the European Parliament and the EU Fisheries Council under the ordinary legislative process (co-decision).</p><p>  The Council of Fisheries Ministers under the Danish Presidency reached a partial general approach on the Basic CFP Regulation and the Common Organisation of the Markets (CMO) at the June Fisheries Council (12 June). This is a significant, though informal, step in the process of working towards final agreement with the European Parliament under the ordinary legislative procedure.  At the October Fisheries Council, a partial general approach of the Council on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) was secured.</p><p>  The European Parliament has completed its first reading of the CMO proposal and is currently conducting its first reading of the basic CFP Regulation and the EMFF proposal.  It is expected that these first readings will be completed in the early part of next year.</p><p>  As it now clear that adoption by 31 December 2012 will not happen, it is my intention to actively endeavour to reach agreement on the Reform package during the Irish presidency in the first half of 2013. I have recently had a series of meetings with Fisheries Ministers, Commissioner Damanaki and with key MEPs to lay the groundwork for achieving agreement.</p><p>  One issue which has arisen with regard to progressing the reform is an inter-institutional one, and refers to the interpretation of Article 43 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Article 43.2 states that the EP and the Council in accordance with the ordinary procedure shall establish the provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the CAP and the CFP, while Article 43.3 states that the Council shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations and on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.</p><p>  The Council has sole remit to set the annual TAC/Quota regulation under article 43.3, however Multi-annual plans which are a cornerstone of the CFP reform fit within the broad parameters of being a measure necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the CFP so are to be introduced under Article 43.2 by co-decision by EP and Council. The issue is that the treaty wording did not foresee of the overlap between the Multi Annual Plans as usually designed and the TAC setting process leaving the roles of each of the institutions in question.</p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

This important relief was due to end this year but is once again being extended.  The relief plays a vital role in encouraging the timely inter-generational transfer of family farms.  Irish and EU agricultural and rural development policies are consistent in providing support and encouragement for the transfer of farms to young farmers.</p><p>  In recent years we have seen a large increase in the number of young people entering agricultural training courses and we need to encourage the early transfer of land to this generation of skilled farmers.  Otherwise the worsening demographic trend within the sector will continue.  Young trained farmers are vital to the smart green strategy being promoted by Food Harvest 2020, which recommended upskilling at all levels within the sector.  They are the farmers that will drive the planned expansion at farm level and play a vital role in ensuring the achievement of Food Harvest 2020 targets.  Given the poor age demographics that exist in the industry there is a need to maximise incentives to encourage more highly trained young people to take up farming as a career.  That is why the stamp duty relief for young trained farmers is being extended in the Finance Bill.</p></reply>

The amount of funding available for payment to Irish farmers under the 2011 and 2012 Schemes was &euro;1.263 billion and &euro;1.255 billion respectively. These funds were used to pay the Single Farm Payment and the Article 68 Schemes namely the Grassland Sheep Scheme, the Dairy Efficiency Programme and the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme.</p><p>  Given the level of the funding involved annually and the importance of the monies paid to farmers&rsquo; income, it is absolutely vital that all of the funding available from the EU is fully drawn down and utilised. Therefore, it is my priority that payments be maximised, both for the benefit of the individual farmers concerned and, on a broader level, the benefit of the country in general.</p><p>  Essentially, the linear reductions to payments under both the 2011 and 2012 Single Payment Schemes are necessary in order to ensure that the National Ceilings for the Scheme for the years in question are respected.</p><p>  However, in pursuing this objective, the budget for the 2011 Scheme was marginally exceeded and the projections for the budget for the 2012 Scheme are similar. In light of this, the only prudent course of action is to apply linear reductions to both years&rsquo; payments. These reductions, at a rate of 0.45% on the payments made, are being applied to the balancing payments now issuing under the 2012 Scheme.  The reductions are applicable to all Single Payment Scheme beneficiaries.</p><p>  There are technical issues involved in relation to the overshoot of the National Ceiling, in that under the EU Commission requirements it is necessary payments under earlier SPS schemes must be accounted in the year in which they are paid. My Department&rsquo;s officials are pursuing this matter with the Commission.</p><p>  Turning to payments in respect of the 2012 SPS Scheme, I am delighted with the level of payments that have been made by my Department since balancing payments commenced less than two weeks ago. In what has been a difficult year for farmers due to the impact of the weather conditions, over &euro;1,193 million was paid to 121,290 farmers (or over 98% of all applicants).  Payments continue to be made as soon as cleared of errors and fully processed.</p></reply>

This inspection regime covers both the eligibility of land declared to drawn down payments and also cross compliance aspects, to ensure adherence with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare.</p><p>  In order to be eligible under the Single Payment Scheme and other area based schemes, an applicant must ensure that all agricultural land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC).  Issues relating to control of rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.</p><p>  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping. Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is there may not be a necessity to cut rushes. However, where a farmer cuts rushes as part of management practice, with the exception of certain designated lands, there are no restrictions on when this is done, enabling the task to be carried out at any time throughout the year once conditions are suitable.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the weather related difficulties being experienced by farmers and of their concern in respect of their ability to meet the various compliance requirements. When conducting inspections, my Department&rsquo;s personnel take prevailing weather conditions into account.  For example, where the practice is to cut rushes and it has not been possible to top them in the current year, inspectors will take a broader assessment including whether there is evidence that they have been cut in previous years.</p><p>  Where land is deemed ineligible, this, in the main, is a result of the inclusion of ineligible areas/features and where it is not being used for an agricultural purpose. In cases where land with rushes is rejected, it will be seen that this is due to the broader issue of insufficient agricultural activity being undertaken on it to keep it in GAEC. My Department therefore does not maintain records specifically on the presence of rushes since the issue has to be seen in the broader context.</p><p>  In the event that a penalty is applied as a result of an inspection, an individual applicant can look for the decision to be reviewed.  The applicant may subsequently appeal the outcome of any such review to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office. Finally, the applicant has the right to pursue the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman. I should state that there is no specific provision in the EU Regulations concerned governing the right of farmers to seek a review of decisions. The review and appeals mechanism was introduced by my Department with a view to ensuring that every decision to impose a penalty could be challenged by individual farmers.</p><p>  In this context, it is important that I stress the importance of the Direct Payment Schemes to both the farmers who receive these payments and also the wider rural economy. Annually these payments amount to some &euro;1.8 billion.  Therefore it is incumbent on my Department to ensure that the EU regulatory control environment is comprehensively implemented to protect these payments, allow the payments to be made quickly and to avoid substantial EU disallowances.</p></reply>

The facts of this case are that the applicant concerned, in 2012, declared a forage area of 18.03 hectares. This area would require a minimum stocking density of 2.7 livestock units in order to satisfy the Scheme. However, it is understood that only one animal is present on this holding, representing 1.0 livestock unit.</p><p>  The appeal process is, of course, available, and should there be particular reasons which have prevented the person concerned having a higher stocking density on the holding in 2012, my Department will further consider the matter.

The situation has been deteriorating for many years, both in Ireland and in the rest of Europe.</p><p>  I have been working to encourage more young people to take up farming as a career.  Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young farmers (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.</p><p>  I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand have introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example Teagasc has recently launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD). Teagasc have also developed recently a new<i></i>  Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. In addition, They have also consulted with the banking sector to make sure that their students know how to prepare business plans and detailed cash-flow plans in support of credit applications.</p><p>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.</p><p>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief has been announced in the2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land.  A recent EU Commission study found that</p><p>&#8216;<i>younger[farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force</i>&#8217;<sup> [[1]</sup> Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas</i>  , p. 25. Brussels, 12/10/2011.<sup>1]</sup></p><p>   Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations. Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.</p><p>  I am hopeful therefore that the measures that I have introduced will encourage more young people into farming and address the age profile imbalance in Irish farming.</p></reply>

In that regard, I have made funding of &euro;10 million available in 2013 to continue to make aid payments on calves born in 2012.  The primary objectives of the Scheme are summarised as follows:</p><p>-Enhance welfare standards for animals produced from the suckler cow herd.</p><p>-Improve husbandry standards at weaning time leading to reduced illness and mortality and enhanced health of the National herd.</p><p>-Provide education and knowledge building among farmers on best practice in suckler herd health and welfare.</p><p>- Improve the genetic quality of the national suckler herd.</p><p>- Improve the competitiveness of the Irish beef industry and the quality of the beef produced.</p><p>  A Value for Money Audit, which was undertaken in accordance with the Department of Finance Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative, established that the Scheme has largely achieved these objectives. The 34,000 participants, who continued in the Scheme over its five-year duration, are fully aware that following best practice in the breeding, animal health/welfare aspects and rearing of suckler calves leads to better prices and demand at weanling sale time.</p><p>  In addition, I have allocated &euro;10 million in 2013, financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds for a new support programme for suckler beef farmers to participate in a new Beef Data Programme.

In total, I have made provision for the payment aid amounting to &euro;25 million to the beef sector in 2013. I announced the establishment of a Beef Technology Adoption Programme in 2012, which will be retained in 2013.

Under the governing EU Regulations, the payment of aid under these measures cannot commence prior to 1 December. I am pleased to announce that payments under the 2012 Grassland Sheep Scheme to sheep farmers will issue in the coming days and that the vast majority of eligible applicants will be paid prior to Christmas. It is not possible to provide the data sought by the Deputy on the outcome of the 2012 Scheme before payments commence. However, I have made arrangements to provide the Deputy with details of payments under the 2011 Grassland Sheep Scheme in the format requested. Gross payments in excess of &euro;17.7 million have issued to date to 17,843 applicants under the 2011 Scheme.</p><p>  This Scheme, as originally implemented, was to run for three years: 2010, 2011 and 2012, with an annual budget of &euro;18 million. I am, however, pleased to confirm that, notwithstanding continued adverse budgetary conditions, I was in a position to secure funding which allows the Scheme continue for a fourth year, albeit with adjusted funding of &euro;14 million.  Direct aid payments are important, but it is time for the sheep sector to adapt and develop their enterprises in line with other sectors. In that regard, I have decided to make funding of &euro;3 million for a new Sheep Technology Adoption Programme, which concept has already proven very successful in both the dairy and beef sectors, with a maximum payment of &euro;1,000 per participant. It is important that sheep farmers take action to increase and maximise their income from their enterprises. This can be achieved by improving breeding, animal health/welfare and grazing regimes. The dairy sector has demonstrated that the discussion group concept to achieve such improvements.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the financial adjustment made to the overall funding to the Grassland Sheep Scheme, hill sheep farmers, who join a Sheep Discussion Group will find that the aid they will receive in 2013 will increase by almost &euro;590.</p></reply>

This inspection regime covers both the eligibility of land declared to drawn down payments and also cross compliance aspects, to ensure adherence with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare.</p><p>  In order to be eligible under the Single Payment Scheme and other area based schemes, an applicant must ensure that all agricultural land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC).  Issues relating to control of rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.</p><p>  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping. Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is there may not be a necessity to cut rushes. However, where a farmer cuts rushes as part of management practice, with the exception of certain designated lands, there are no restrictions on when this is done, enabling the task to be carried out at any time throughout the year once conditions are suitable.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the weather related difficulties being experienced by farmers and of their concern in respect of their ability to meet the various compliance requirements. When conducting inspections, my Department&rsquo;s personnel take prevailing weather conditions into account.  For example, where the practice is to cut rushes and it has not been possible to top them in the current year, inspectors will take a broader assessment including whether there is evidence that they have been cut in previous years.  Where land is deemed ineligible, this, in the main, is a result of the inclusion of ineligible areas/features and where it is not being used for an agricultural purpose. In cases where land with rushes is rejected, it will be seen that this is due to the broader issue of insufficient agricultural activity being undertaken on it to keep it in GAEC.</p><p>  In the event that a penalty is applied as a result of an inspection, an individual applicant can look for the decision to be reviewed.  The applicant may subsequently appeal the outcome of any such review to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office. Finally, the applicant has the right to pursue the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman. I should state that there is no specific provision in the EU Regulations concerned governing the right of farmers to seek a review of decisions. The review and appeals mechanism was introduced by my Department with a view to ensuring that every decision to impose a penalty could be challenged by individual farmers.</p><p>  In this context, it is important that I stress the importance of the Direct Payment Schemes to both the farmers who receive these payments and also the wider rural economy. Annually these payments amount to some &euro;1.8 billion.  Therefore it is incumbent on my Department to ensure that the EU regulatory control environment is comprehensively implemented to protect these payments, allow the payments to be made quickly and to avoid substantial EU disallowances.</p></reply>

It does not introduce any new requirements on farmers. Animal welfare is an essential part of farming practices and the Animal Health and Welfare Bill represents a further step towards improving Ireland&rsquo;s already high welfare standards and practices. Markets and consumers already recognise high animal welfare standards as an added value and enhancing welfare standards will serve to increase the competitiveness of Irish agricultural products. It is evident from recent grant schemes that my Department supports animal welfare programmes, for example the Sow Housing welfare scheme and the Laying Hen scheme which were brought in through the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme. My Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that Ireland can achieve the highest possible animal welfare standards across the board.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-13a.83.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121300061#WRC02300"><p>Bearing in mind that the 2013 Budget was agreed against a background of a very difficult financial situation, I managed, with re-orienting and re-scheduling payments within my Department&rsquo;s budget, to keep the adjustments made to Schemes to a minimum. It was also my objective to protect, in so far as is possible, the smaller-scale farmers situated in Disadvantaged Areas.  </p><p>  In relation to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I am extremely pleased that, even within the tight budgetary disciplines, I was able to increase the funding for this Scheme by &euro;5 million in 2013, to bring the total funds available up to &euro;195 million. However, in view of the existing level of expenditure under this Scheme in 2012, it is still necessary to make adjustments, in order to keep within the new allocation. I have, however, ensured that farmers, particularly sheep farmers farming mountain type grazing, will not have their aid, which is important to the viability of their farming enterprises, reduced. In order the carry out the adjustment, I decided to reduce the area maximum area payable from 34 to 30 hectares in respect of farmers situated in More Severely and Less Severely Disadvantaged Areas. By achieving this adjustment in this manner, together with a number of technical changes, over 72% of all applicants will not have their basic aid changed.</p><p>  The Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme was a five-year Scheme which is ending on 31 December 2012. I have, however, made funding of &euro;10 million available for this Scheme in 2013. These funds will be used to continue to pay calves born the herds of Scheme participants when they become eligible for payment. Payments in respect of 2012 born calves, which are now eligible for payment, will commence next week. Taking into account payments of &euro;22 million, which will be issued in respect of 2012 born calves, the Exchequer will have paid &euro;158 million in total under this Scheme. This is a very substantial contribution to the very important beef sector. I am, therefore, pleased that a Value for Money Audit, which was undertaken in accordance with the Department of Finance Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative, established that the Scheme has largely achieved these objectives. The 34,000 participants, who continued in the Scheme over its five-year duration, are fully aware that following best practice in the breeding, animal health/welfare aspects and rearing of suckler calves leads to better prices and demand at weanling sale time.</p><p>  It was important to build on progress made under the lifetime of the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. Therefore, I have allocated &euro;10 million in 2013, financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds for a new support programme for suckler farmers to participate in a new Beef Data Programme. When taken together with residual payments of &euro;10 million under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, this will amount to &euro;20 million in direct payments to suckler farmers in 2013. This programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers. In addition, the sum of &euro;5 million has been set aside to support the continuation for another year of the Beef Technology Adaptation Programme, a scheme that provides beef farmers with better information and improved skills to increase profitability on farms.</p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is one of the measures funded by unused Single Farm Payment funds. This Scheme, as originally implemented, was to run for three years: 2010, 2011 and 2012, with an annual budget of &euro;18 million. I am, however, pleased to confirm that, notwithstanding continued adverse budgetary conditions, I was in a position to secure funding which allows the Scheme continue for a fourth year, albeit with adjusted funding of &euro;14 million. </p><p>  Direct aid payments are important, but it is time for the sheep sector to adapt and develop their enterprises in line with other sectors. In that regard, I have decided to make funding of &euro;3 million for a new Sheep Technology Adoption Programme, which concept has already proven very successful in both the dairy and beef sectors, with a maximum payment of &euro;1,000 per participant. It is important that sheep farmers take action to increase and maximise their income from their enterprises. This can be achieved by improving breeding, animal health/welfare and grazing regimes. The dairy sector has demonstrated that the discussion group concept to achieve such improvements. Notwithstanding the financial adjustment made to the overall funding to the Grassland Sheep Scheme, hill sheep farmers, who join a Sheep Discussion Group, will find that the aid they will receive in 2013 will increase by almost &euro;590.       </p></reply>

This Scheme was a five-year Scheme for beef animals born in herds owned by eligible participants during the period, which commenced on 1 January 2008 and ending on 31 December 2012. In that regard, I have made funding of &euro;10 million available in 2013 to continue to make aid payments on calves born in 2012.  The primary objectives of the Scheme are summarised as follows:</p><p>  - Enhance welfare standards for animals produced from the suckler cow herd.</p><p>  - Improve husbandry standards at weaning time leading to reduced illness and mortality and enhanced health of the National herd.</p><p>  - Provide education and knowledge building among farmers on best practice in suckler 	herd health and welfare.</p><p>  - Improve the genetic quality of the national suckler herd.</p><p>  - Improve the competitiveness of the Irish beef industry and the quality of the beef produced.</p><p>  A Value for Money Audit, which was undertaken in accordance with the Department of Finance Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative, established that the Scheme has largely achieved these objectives. The 34,000 participants, who continued in the Scheme over its five-year duration, are fully aware that following best practice in the breeding, animal health/welfare aspects and rearing of suckler calves leads to better prices and demand at weanling sale time.  </p><p>  In addition, I have allocated &euro;10 million in 2013, financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds for a new support programme for suckler beef farmers to participate in a new Beef Data Programme. This programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers.</p><p>  In total, I have made provision for the payment aid amounting to &euro;25 million to the beef sector in 2013. I announced the establishment of a Beef Technology Adoption Programme in 2012, which will be retained in 2013. This Programme is built on the lessons of the Dairy Efficiency Programme and provided a &euro;5 million financial stimulus to encourage, through the medium of professionally facilitated discussion groups, and a task oriented approach, the adoption of a more focussed commercial approach to beef farming. </p></reply>

In addition, farmers who are not satisfied with the service provided by their banks can apply to the Credit Review Office to have their case reviewed.</p><p>  Financial difficulties will also be alleviated by improved productivity, enhanced skills and higher prices.  In that context, the implementation of Food Harvest 2020 has a major role to play in improving overall competitiveness at farm and industry level as well in maximising the potential contribution of this indigenous sector to economic recovery.  Significant progress has been made to date on its implementation. <i>Milestones for Success 2012</i>   indicates that substantial action has been taken on 40% of the recommendations while a further 50% are being implemented.  The workings of the Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee, which I chair, and our close engagement with industry is ensuring that all stakeholders actively commit to its work vision and targets.  As a consequence, good progress made on the FH2020 targets and that the value of both primary output and exports has increased by almost 19% and 10% respectively vis-a vis the relevant 33% and 42% target increase set for 2020. The latest figures from the CSO also show that, by end 2010, the value- added element of the sector has increased by 5.6%.</p></reply>

The Conclusions supported the idea of establishing a Forum to address the relationships between the players in the food supply chain.</p><p>  In response the European Commission established a High Level Forum and a business-to-business Expert Platform to make recommendations on eliminating unfair practices.  During 2011 the Platform agreed on a list of general and specific principles of good practice as well as relevant best practices in commercial relations.  These were endorsed by the Forum and the Commission requested the Platform to identify possible actions taking into account the positions expressed by Council and the European Parliament.   The Expert Platform made progress in 2012 but did not reach agreement on the form of implementing arrangements and whether there should be statutory provision.  At the Forum meeting on 5 December the Commission indicated that it will now adopt a green paper on unfair trading practices in the retail supply chain which will involve a horizontal cross-sector approach. The Commission is also contracting a study on legal frameworks in Member States that seek to address unfair trading practices and is considering launching an impact assessment on different options including a legislative initiative in this field, taking into account the advice of national authorities and of all the relevant stakeholders.  This will in due course be reviewed by Council.</p></reply>

The Department&#8217;s 2013 Exchequer allocation is &#8364;1.25 billion, including &#8364;6m capital carry-over from 2012. The original budget reduction envisaged for my Department for 2013 under the expenditure ceiling was &#8364;114 million. Through negotiation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I secured much-needed additional capital funding of &#8364;25m, including the carry-over, thus reducing the cut in expenditure from 2012 to 2013 to &#8364;89m.</p><p>  In allocating the available funding, I was determined to minimise the impact of the scale of the reduction so that the most important schemes and programmes were protected to the greatest extent possible<i>.  </i>Through re-orientating and re-scheduling payments, I have also managed to fund some new worthwhile programmes while remaining within the financial constraints.  In overall terms, the 2013 Estimate for my Department represents a significant Exchequer commitment of support for the agri-food sector and is recognition of the contribution which the sector can make to economic recovery and future growth. My priorities are to:</p><p> - Protect the incomes of family farms</p><p> - favour small farm holdings in disadvantaged areas</p><p> - provide taxation measures to restructure, modernise and promote growth in the agri-food and farming sector</p><p> - provide support programmes in line with the targets of Food Harvest 2020, in particular job creation</p><p> - support the future of the sector through funding for research and development and through investment in food safety and animal health and welfare controls</p><p> - continue a programme of reform within the Department aimed at improving service delivery and reducing costs.   </p><p>  In specific terms, I have:</p><p> - minimised reductions in expenditure in the Disadvantaged Areas Schemes while protecting the most disadvantaged from any cut,</p><p> - replaced the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme with a new measure and</p><p> - avoided any cut in REPS payments by restructuring payments in 2013 and early 2014.</p><p>  At the same time, I have provided funding for new producer group activities in the sheep and dairy sectors while the additional funding for capital which I have secured will enable my Department to continue to implement a range of schemes including forestry planting and the schemes for on-farm investment.  </p><p>  I believe that the outlook for the agri-food sector remains very bright and the sector will continue to contribute strongly to national economic recovery.  There is a new awareness of the vital economic importance of the sector and a strong recognition that the sector has the fundamental building blocks in place to reach the demanding targets it has set itself in Food Harvest 2020, a blueprint that will contribute hugely to the growth in food and drink exports and to national prosperity. I am confident that the measures introduced in Budget 2013, in a very challenging fiscal environment, will help us to continue on this path towards national recovery.</p></reply>

This Scheme was a five-year Scheme for beef animals born in herds owned by eligible participants during the period, which commenced on 1 January 2008 and ending on 31 December 2012. In that regard, I have made funding of &euro;10 million available in 2013 to continue to make aid payments on calves born in 2012.  The primary objectives of the Scheme are summarised as follows:</p><p> - Enhance welfare standards for animals produced from the suckler cow herd.</p><p> - Improve husbandry standards at weaning time leading to reduced illness and mortality and enhanced health of the National herd.</p><p> - Provide education and knowledge building among farmers on best practice in suckler herd health and welfare.</p><p> - Improve the genetic quality of the national suckler herd.</p><p> - Improve the competitiveness of the Irish beef industry and the quality of the beef  produced.</p><p>  A Value for Money Audit, which was undertaken in accordance with the Department of Finance Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative, established that the Scheme has largely achieved these objectives. The 34,000 participants, who continued in the Scheme over its five-year duration, are fully aware that following best practice in the breeding, animal health/welfare aspects and rearing of suckler calves leads to better prices and demand at weanling sale time.  In addition, I have allocated &euro;10 million in 2013, financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds for a new support programme for suckler beef farmers to participate in a new Beef Data Programme. This programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers..</p><p>  In total, I have made provision for the payment of aid amounting to &euro;25 million to the beef sector in 2013. I announced the establishment of a Beef Technology Adoption Programme in 2012, which will be retained in 2013. This Programme is built on the lessons of the Dairy Efficiency Programme and provided a &euro;5 million financial stimulus to encourage, through the medium of professionally facilitated discussion groups, and a task oriented approach, the adoption of a more focussed commercial approach to beef farming.</p></reply>

A profile of projected expenditure on a monthly basis is drawn up at the beginning of each financial year in order to anticipate the Department&rsquo;s funding requirements and financial management over the course of the year.  The profile which is the best estimate of expenditure available at that time is difficult to forecast and may vary significantly during the year for a variety of reasons, such as the level of payments under demand led schemes, the pattern of draw-down of Grants-in-Aid by State bodies, etc.  </p><p>  The total actual gross expenditure incurred over the period 1 January to end November was &euro;1.046 billion.

Taking into account payments of &euro;22 million approximately, which will be issued in respect of 2012 born calves, over the coming months, the Exchequer will have paid &euro;158 million in total under this Scheme. This is a very substantial contribution to the very important beef sector. I am, therefore, pleased that a Value for Money Audit, which was undertaken in accordance with the Department of Finance Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative, established that the Scheme has largely achieved these objectives. The 34,000 participants, who continued in the Scheme over its five-year duration, are fully aware that following best practice in the breeding, animal health/welfare aspects and rearing of suckler calves leads to better prices and demand at weanling sale time.</p><p>  It was important to build on progress made under the lifetime of the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. Therefore, I have allocated &euro;10 million in 2013, financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds for a new support programme for suckler farmers to participate in a new Beef Data Programme. When taken together with residual payments of &euro;10 million under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, this will amount to &euro;20 million in direct payments to suckler farmers in 2013. This programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers. </p><p>  The objectives of the new measure are summarised as follows.</p><p> - An increase in the number of commercial suckler herds that are engaged in the submission of beef data for breeding purposes;</p><p> - An increase in the amount of data from commercial farms around the country on traits of high relevance to beef farmers (e.g. Sire, dam, calving ease, weanling quality, docility) that can be used in genetic evaluations;</p><p> - Substantially more accurate genetic evaluations for a wide range of traits. The lack of data recording hampers the production of Beef Genetic indexes with reliable figures (large volumes of data are needed to increase reliability/accuracy);</p><p> - An increase in the uptake of cattle breeding related information services;</p><p> - An increase in the use that commercial beef producers make of genetic evaluations;</p><p> - Improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s capability to capitalise on Genomics technology in the beef herd. This technology has already enabled the acceleration of genetic gain in the dairy herd (worth an extra &euro;30m per annum to the dairy sector).  Without the scheme, this will not be possible on the beef side.</p><p>  The exact details of this new measure are being finalised and my priority is to ensure that the funding is fully utilised within the suckler sector. My view is that the level of funding (&euro;10 million) made available is more than sufficient to encourage suckler farmers to participate in this one measure given that the total  amount of aid paid to date under the 2012 Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme on 2012 born calves is approximately &euro;22 million.</p></reply>

The December Council will also decide on fishing effort, which determines days spent at sea, available for the Irish fleet in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast for 2013.</p><p>  The European Commission proposals for 2013 are based on formal advice received from ICES (the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas), and also on the views of the STECF (the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries).  The process of preparing for the Council is well under way with the publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals for TACs and quotas of key stocks of interest to Ireland.  Since the publication of the proposals I have conducted a number of bi-laterals with the EU Commission, a number of Member States and the Irish fishing industry. I have also formally commented on the Commission proposal in advance of negotiations.</p><p>  I have had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal on internal TACs through the preparation of a Sea Fisheries Sustainability Impact Assessment which is provided for in the Programme for Government.  I presented the results of this Impact Assessment to the D&aacute;il on 6 December. The Impact Assessment acknowledges that while many stocks in which the Irish fleet have an interest are not in a healthy biological state, there has been an improvement in 2012 on the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators. It  agrees with the need to cut quotas for some  of the stocks in 2013, though the level of these cuts is queried  in some cases, while in others there is clear scientific data to suggest that the level of cut is unwarranted.</p><p>  I have repeated many times my belief that decisions on setting TACS should be informed by the science available and I stick to that. I am opposed to blanket rules on so called &ldquo;data poor&rdquo; stocks requiring automatic reductions, even where the quantitive information available shows that the stock is being fished sustainably and where the biological indicators are positive.  The non-agreement at the Coastal States talks on mackerel, blue whiting and atlanto scandian herring aligned to the inconclusive second round of bilateral negotiations between the EU and Norway, now means that some stocks where Ireland have an interest including mackerel , horse mackerel, blue whiting, ling &amp; saithe will be subject to provisional quotas at the December Council.  Coastal States negotiations on blue whiting and atlanto scandian herring will resume on December 14 in London. The discussions with Norway are scheduled to reconvene in Clonakilty on the 16th January; it is expected that final quotas will be determined early in the Irish Presidency.</p></reply>

To this end, we continue to encourage an early resumption of dialogue by the parties.</p><p>  The promotion of human rights is an important dimension of European foreign policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union. Constructive dialogue remains the EU&rsquo;s preferred channel for working to improve the human rights situation in China. Human rights are discussed as part of regular political dialogue as well as during specific human rights dialogues with China which have taken place since 1995.  The Irish Government continues to convey its concerns about the situation in Tibet directly to the Chinese authorities through regular contacts in both Dublin and Beijing. The issue of Tibet is also raised by the European Union in its dialogue with China.  Most recently, the EU raised the issue of Tibet at the 31st round of the EU-China human rights dialogue in Brussels at the end of May.</p></reply>

A further allocation of &#8364;36m has been included in the Estimates for Public Services, published on 5 December last.  A further &#8364;10m has also been included to address security costs related to both the Presidency and the OSCE Ministerial Council meeting held in Dublin last week.</p><p>  This budget is broadly in line with budgets for recent Presidencies and is less than the budget for the Irish Presidency in 2004 where total expenditure, when all costs were taken into account, was approximately &#8364;110m.  Expenditure in 2012 focused primarily on planning costs which included:</p><p> - the refurbishment of Dublin Castle conference facilities;</p><p> - the fitting out of extra office accommodation within the Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels; </p><p> - Increased staffing in Dublin and Brussels to support the Presidency;</p><p> - Costs for re-location of additional staff to the Permanent Representation;</p><p> - The development of a Presidency website;</p><p> - The development of an accreditation system to handle the approx 15,000 delegates expected to visit Ireland. This system was also used for the OSCE Ministerial meeting;</p><p> - The provision of Presidency materials such as stationery and branding;</p><p> - The preparation of a Cultural programme;</p><p> - Increased travel to Brussels and Strasbourg in the build-up to the Presidency.</p><p>  The majority of expenditure in 2013 will be for the following:</p><p> - the management of the Presidency agenda in home Departments;</p><p> - the operation of a significantly-enlarged Permanent Representation in Brussels (+90 people); </p><p> - a programme of Presidency events taking place in Ireland;</p><p> - a cultural programme that uses the Presidency to promote Ireland and Irish culture to an international<b></b>audience and which also showcases the role of the EU in Ireland.</p><p>  To date approximately 20 proposals of sponsorship have been received in respect of the Presidency.  These cover a wide spectrum of companies from smaller domestic companies to larger multinationals and include offers of support in relation to transport, telecommunications, IT-related projects and to cover certain event costs. In addition, State agencies and other bodies have been of assistance in providing services and support. The assessment of sponsorship offers is underway and a full list of sponsors will be released when this is finalised.</p><p>  An overarching focus of the Government in planning for Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union is to perform this important function in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  The use of Dublin Castle and a small number of other state-owned venues mainly in Dublin to host most Presidency meetings will reduce venue hire, transport and set-up costs, not to mention significantly reducing the &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; of the Presidency.  An effectively managed Presidency will deliver long-term reputational benefits for Ireland.  Short-term benefits include significant benefits for the local economy from an influx of up to 15,000 delegates, press and representatives of NGOs who will use local services including hotels, restaurants, taxis etc. over the six month Presidency period.</p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.</p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress will intensify over the coming weeks and months with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise. It is therefore not possible at this stage to specify its contents or identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

That High Level Group is due to issue its final report in the near future.      During my meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on 6 December last we discussed the importance of laying the ground for such an Agreement, should a decision be made to open negotiations during Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming Presidency of the EU.

The responsibility for chairing the OSCE, the world&rsquo;s largest inter-governmental regional security organisation, is a significant honour and challenge for Ireland and for me personally.   From the outset, our Chairmanship objectives were to ensure balance and coherence across the three main policy areas of the OSCE, namely its politico-military dimension, its economic and environmental dimension and the so-called &ldquo;human dimension&rdquo;, which covers human rights and fundamental freedoms.  I have also explored opportunities to make progress towards lasting settlements of the &ldquo;protracted conflicts&rdquo; in the OSCE area.</p><p>  The general assessment of the Irish Chairmanship&rsquo;s performance has been extremely positive.   We have had a productive year across all areas of the OSCE&rsquo;s work.  In February, I addressed the UN Security Council on our priorities and discussed these also with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon.  I visited Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan in June and underlined the Chairmanship&rsquo;s commitment to making progress towards the peaceful settlement of the &ldquo;protracted conflicts&rdquo; in the region.  Minister of State Creighton visited Moldova in September and conveyed our strong support for the Transdniestrian settlement process; she has also visited a number of Western Balkan countries which feature on the OSCE&rsquo;s agenda.  </p><p>  We have hosted a number of successful high-level conferences in Dublin and Vienna during the year.   In April, I hosted a conference in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, entitled &lsquo;Shared Future: Building and Sustaining Peace, the Northern Ireland case study&rsquo;.  This event provided, for people engaged with conflict resolution elsewhere in the OSCE region, a first-hand account of the Northern Ireland peace process and its possible relevance in other conflict situations.  The Dublin Conference on Internet Freedom took place on 18-19 June in Dublin Castle.  It focused on ways to ensure that the internet remains an open, global and public forum for freedom of opinion and expression and a platform for facilitating the exercise of other human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p><p>  In addition to the successful Chairmanship conferences held earlier this year, I recently hosted in Dublin the OSCE&rsquo;s annual Ministerial Council.  This was the largest ever meeting of Ministers in Ireland.  Among those who attended were the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, and the High Representative of the EU, Catherine Ashton.  </p><p>It is a particular achievement that agreement was reached at the OSCE Ministerial on the Helsinki +40 process.  On the initiative of the Irish Chairmanship, a strategic roadmap has now been agreed for a process of reflection on the work of the OSCE, to be undertaken between now and 2015, the 40th   anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act.  Other significant agreements include, for the first time in ten years, a joint statement on the Transdniestrian settlement process (which recognises the progress achieved in the several sessions of the 5 + 2 settlement negotiations which took place under our Chairmanship, including two sessions in Ireland); a declaration on strengthening good governance; and a decision on transnational threats, which consolidates work over the past year.  We were also able to reach agreement on the accession of Mongolia as a new participant State and to welcome them to the table in Dublin.</p><p>  The lack of a consensus to agree any decisions in the human dimension is a matter of regret.  It is unfortunate that this worrying trend of recent Ministerial Councils has continued.  As Chair-in-Office, I gave prominence to a number of key human rights issues.   While agreement was not possible on a decision relating to the strengthening of media freedom, I was pleased that, following the closing session of the Ministerial last week, Ireland signed a US Declaration on Fundamental Freedoms in the Digital Age.</p><p>  Ireland has reaped several benefits from chairing the OSCE this year, including a significantly raised international profile.  We have enhanced our reputation for diplomacy and crisis management and have expanded our expertise in relation to conflict resolution and human rights, both key features of our foreign policy.  Our Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2013 and our impending membership of the UN Human Rights Council will, I hope, enable us to consolidate these gains.</p></reply>

The Government has also decided that the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge will cease to be payable with effect from 1 January 2014.  Residential properties rented by landlords will be subject to Local Property Tax from 1 July 2013, with the owners of the property &ndash; in those cases, the landlord &ndash; being the liable person for payment of the tax.    However any arrears of Household Charge due in respect of the period up to 31 December 2012 must be discharged.  Arrears outstanding on 1 July 2013 will be increased to &euro;200 and will be treated as Local Property Tax payable to the Revenue Commissioners.  Arrears of Non Principal Private Residence charge outstanding on 1 January 2014 will also have to be discharged.  </p><p>  With regard to PRSI on rental income, the position is as I stated in my Budget day speech on 6 December 2012.   The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is bringing forward legislation to change PRSI contributions as follows:  </p><p>-Where modified PRSI rate payers have income from a trade or profession, such income and any unearned income they have will be made subject to PRSI with effect from 1 January 2013.   </p><p>-Unearned income for all employees will become subject to PRSI in 2014.  This means that PRSI will be payable on all income generated from wealth such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposit and savings.    </p><p>  Prior to Budget 2013, modified contributors paid PRSI on earnings derived from their employment but did not pay PRSI on any other stream of income e.g. from a trade or profession, or on unearned income (dividends etc.) </p><p>  As a result of Budget 2013, modified contributors who have income from a trade or profession will now be subject to PRSI (at a rate of 4%) on the profits from the trade or profession and also on any unearned income that they may have, which would include rental income.  PRSI will apply at a rate of 4% on the profits from the rental income.   </p><p>  Modified contributors are generally permanent and pensionable civil and public servants recruited before 6 April 1995; for example, registered doctors and dentists employed in the civil service recruited prior to 6 April 1995.    </p><p>  The report of the Expert Group on the Design of a Local Property Tax, chaired by Dr Don Thornhill, recommended that Local Property Tax paid in respect of a rented property should be deductible for tax purposes, in the same way as commercial rates are deductible for tax purposes.  It is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis.  However, it is not provided for in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill as initiated.</p></reply>

To date, Ireland has signed 68 double taxation agreements, of which 61 are in effect.</p><p><i>Revisions of existing treaties</i></p><p>The existing treaties with Canada (2003) and the United States (1997) replace earlier agreements from 1966 and 1949 respectively.  The treaty with the United Kingdom (1976) replaces earlier agreements dating from 1926.</p><p>Treaties may also be revised by way of a protocol to the existing agreement.  This is an ongoing process and several of Ireland&rsquo;s treaties have amending protocols.  The treaties with Austria (1966), Switzerland (1966) and the United Kingdom (1976) each has two protocols; there are also protocols updating the treaties with Germany (1962), Malaysia (1998), Portugal (1993), South Africa (1997), Sweden (1986) and the United States (1997).  The details are shown in the attached table.</p><p>A new treaty will replace the existing treaty with Germany (1962) with effect from 1 January 2013.  The existing treaty with the Netherlands (1962) is currently under renegotiation.  There are only a small number of other treaties that are more than 40 years old and that have not been amended since date of signing, namely Belgium (1970), Cyprus (1968), France (1968), Italy (1971), Luxembourg (1972) and Zambia (1971).  Of these, a protocol to the treaty with Belgium has been negotiated and it is expected that it will be signed shortly.</p><p><i>Treaties under negotiation and expansion of the base </i></p><p>Negotiations for a new agreement with Ukraine have been concluded.  It is expected that this treaty will be signed shortly.  It will come into force when both sides ratify it.  Negotiations with Azerbaijan and with Thailand are nearing completion.</p><p>It would not be practicable to produce a tabular list of countries with which Ireland does not have a double taxation treaty.  However, it can be seen from the attached table that there are gaps in Ireland's treaty coverage in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia.  Approaches are being made, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to initiate negotiations with countries in each of these areas.   The potential of double taxation agreements to support Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism and investment strategy is taken into account in identifying countries with which we seek to enter into negotiations for such agreements.</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px"><b>Date of Entry into effect</b></div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom:

This represents a very substantial contribution by NAMA in the context of the limited number of available residential properties in Ireland controlled by its debtors and receivers and the range of policy measures being adopted by this Government to meet demand for social housing provision.  </p><p>  The onus for determining the suitability for social housing of the units identified by NAMA rests, in the first instance, with the local authorities, which assess, in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the demand for identified houses and apartments by reference to criteria including the avoidance of undue segregation in housing within specific developments and areas.  Once local authorities have confirmed demand for units, the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are, through the Housing Agency, asked to confirm and progress their interest in leasing or purchasing the units.</p><p>  I am advised that to date demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 1,484 of the properties that NAMA has made available. Another 841 properties are being evaluated bringing the overall total that may be deemed suitable to 2,325 potentially.   The local authorities have confirmed that there is no demand in respect of 902 of the properties. I am advised by NAMA that, in the time required by local authorities to assess and confirm demand for units, 652 properties have been sold or privately let by their owners or duly appointed receivers. </p><p>  Of the properties for which demand has been confirmed, 133 were delivered for social housing during the year, contract terms have been signed or agreed in respect of a further 84 properties and negotiations are at an advanced stage in relation to the majority of the remaining units. A further 563 residential properties are also subject to active negotiation by the various AHBs which brings the overall total residential properties completed and committed to 704 for 2012.   </p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that once demand has been confirmed for units and contracts signed there is no impediment to the early delivery of properties by its debtors and receivers for social housing.  I am further advised by NAMA that it recently established a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to acquire units from its debtors and receivers where necessary to speed up their direct leasing to housing authorities.  NAMA advises that once the AHBs have confirmed their demand for and contracted to lease properties it will be in a position to make them available through the SPV.</p><p>  NAMA is working very closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State for Housing and Planning in relation to this very important initiative and all parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential units in 2013.  The Deputy will appreciate that the housing authorities have a key role in this regard and the Housing Agency is working very closely with these bodies to facilitate delivery of units.    However, the pace at which units are delivered is not controlled by NAMA and I am satisfied that NAMA has brought the initiative as far as it can at this point in time. 	</p></reply>

As part of this marketing campaign the Agency markets all available land and buildings in the County.  Based on the strengths of the region, IDA Ireland is targeting, in particular, the ICT, International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors.  In addition, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions and F&Aacute;S to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county. </p><p>  As Ireland competes for investments at the highest end of the value chain the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading corporations require significant population pools of highly qualified talent, appropriate physical and digital infrastructure and the availability of sophisticated professional and support services.  In order to meet this challenge IDA focuses on marketing the Gateway locations within each region.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway Economic Region has a positive impact on other Gateway Economic Regions and their surrounding areas.  The recent Northern Trust announcement in Limerick, creating some 400 jobs, will have a positive economic impact directly and indirectly on County Kerry. </p><p>  At the end of 2011 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing approximately 1,300 permanent staff.  Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location by potential investors, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor.</p></reply>

Ireland does not ratify international Conventions until any such necessary amendments to domestic legislation have been identified and effected. </p><p>  My officials are finalising work in relation to an assessment of the implications of ratifying the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s Convention 189 on Domestic Workers.  The Assessment includes an article-by-article examination of the extent to which domestic legislation provisions already provide for the rights and entitlements enunciated in each article, as well as the extent to which any legislative amendments will be required.  This assessment will then be forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for their examination. </p><p>  As one of the articles in the ILO Convention relates to an EU competence, Ireland as part of our Presidency will be bringing forward a proposal for a Council decision which confirms that there are no legal impediments at the level of the EU to ratification by Member States of the ILO Convention. </p><p>  It is important, to note, however, that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.  Also it is worth pointing out that NERA has carried out a programme of inspections involving Domestic Workers as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from Domestic Workers.</p><p>  A voluntary Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes was developed under the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&rsquo;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question.</p></reply>

Section 2(4) of the 2003 Act places an onus on the employer to carry out reasonably thorough checks in order to be satisfied that a prospective employee does not require an employment permit, or that one has been obtained.</p><p>  Officers of my Department, specifically, inspectors of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), are authorised to exercise powers under the Employment Permit Acts.  If in the course of an inspection NERA finds evidence to suggest that an employee does not have a valid Work Permit, both the employer and employee are advised of the need to regularise the position and of the consequences of failing to do so.  An employer failing to rectify matters could be prosecuted.  NERA commenced taking proceedings under S.2 of the 2003 Act in 2012.  To date, 14 prosecutions against employers have been initiated.  No prosecutions against employees have been taken by NERA to date.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also an enforcement authority under Employment Permits legislation with prosecution powers.  Statistics on Garda prosecutions would be within the remit of my colleague Alan Shatter TD, Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  NERA seeks to secure compliance with employment law including employment permit law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and enforcement where necessary.  While every effort is made to secure compliance, some employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and/or pay money due to their employees.  These employers are referred for prosecution.  NERA inspectors now being authorised officers under the Employment Permits Acts have made compliance checks under this legislation an integral element of all NERA inspections.  Joint inspections may also be carried out as part of investigations involving the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Social Protection staff and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  During the course of 2012 to date, a total number of 4052 inspections have been carried out.</p><p>  Separate statistics are not maintained in respect of inspections carried out with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Joint investigations are carried out with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  This figure is collected on an annual basis and the latest figures for 2011 show that 118 such investigations took place.  Information exchanged between the aforementioned bodies has helped to uncover non-compliance with employment law, secure payment of wages for employees and save the Exchequer money. </p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p><p>  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received on a weekly basis</p><p>  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the continuous weekly intake and backlog claims clearance.  This plan sees the current weekly intake of new and renewal claims processed by one team as they are received since the start of November, while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.</p><p>  This team which included additional temporary resources is currently working on the backlog claims.  In order to reduce the time it will take to eliminate the backlog, some of these claims are being processed outside of Longford Social Welfare Services Office.  This team is fully focussed on the elimination of the backlog of claims in the shortest possible timeframe, concentrating in the first instance on those claims which were previously in payment but where payment has expired and continuing on to first-time new claims.  Within those categories, those waiting the longest will be processed first.</p><p>  It is intended that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.</p></reply>

For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.

Credits are awarded in respect of an employment contribution which is defined as a contribution in respect of an employed contributor.  There are no provisions for the award of credits on foot of self-employment contributions.   Self-employed individuals who wish to preserve the continuity of their social insurance record for pension purposes have the opportunity to do so by becoming a voluntary contributor.</p></reply>

The current fuel season commenced in October this year and will finish in on April 2013, a total of 26 weeks.</p><p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is a short-term payment and is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance which is means tested and paid to long term welfare recipients. A person will only be paid a fuel allowance while on a community employment (CE) scheme if they were entitled to fuel allowance prior to commencing the CE scheme.  A person cannot accrue an entitlement to fuel allowance while on a CE scheme.</p><p>  When the CE scheme ends the participant is entitled to make an application for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  They may have built up sufficient PRSI contributions to allow them to apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. The reason a person may be in receipt of a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is that the rates of payment are graduated according to earnings in the relevant tax year. For example a person with earnings of less than &euro;150 per week would be entitled to a personal rate of &euro;84.50 in 2012. The graduated rates are in place to ensure that disincentives to employment are not created or a situation exists where workers on low incomes would have access to weekly social welfare payments greatly in excess of their income from employment. </p><p>  If a person is in receipt of a reduced rate jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment and their income is insufficient to meet their needs, they may, subject to a means test, be eligible for a top-up under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may also opt to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p><p>  I have no plans to amend the qualifying criteria for fuel allowance.</p></reply>

This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  T&uacute;s is designed to break the cycle of unemployment and to improve a person&rsquo;s opportunities in returning to the labour market.  I consider the existing 12-month period on T&uacute;s to be adequate to meet the objectives of the initiative whilst also ensuring that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the initiative. There are no circumstances under which a person&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s will be extended beyond 12 months and it is not in the interest of any participant that such work placements of this extend for prolonged periods of time.  As part of the budget package for my Department, I intend to extend the number of opportunities available on T&uacute;s by another 2,500.  These additional placements will be allocated following consultation with the Implementing Bodies by the end of the first quarter of 2013.</p></reply>

CE combines employment and training interventions while at the same time supporting the provision of social services to local communities.</p><p>  Depending on the length of time an applicant is unemployed the duration on CE is one year up to three years with the option of a further year extension for persons who are over 3 years in receipt of a welfare payment.   </p><p>  There are currently 7,966 participants on CE who have been on the programme for 2 or more and these represent approximately one-third of 23,300 places on CE. The T&uacute;s programme has a budget of 5,000 places in 2012. There are differences between CE and T&uacute;s in terms of the profile of participants coming onto the programme, duration and programme content. The range of profiles of new entrants is broader on CE and includes people with a disability, lone parents as well as people on the Live Register.  Participation on T&uacute;s is confined to people on the Live Register.  AS CE is an Active Labour Market Programme which prepares participants for entry to employment there is little added value in terms of offering a further year on T&uacute;s. This is particularly in the context of high unemployment and demand for activation places to meet the Department&rsquo;s commitments under Pathways to Work. </p><p>  However, there has been a recent change to CE which allows T&uacute;s participants under certain circumstances to enter CE.  This particularly applies to T&uacute;s participants who are in need of training and where further supports are necessary for progression.  Following the recent budget announcements, an additional 2,000 places will be allocated to CE and 2,500 to T&uacute;s during 2013. </p><p>  Earlier this year, a financial review of individual CE schemes was undertaken by local staff in this Department. This was a very valuable exercise and substantial savings have already been achieved in the operational costs of the programme. These savings will continue to be achieved in 2013. CE costs are now comparable with T&uacute;s costs. The broad policy direction for CE in 2013 is based on the main action points coming from the CE Financial Review which has been recently published. These focus on the provision of training qualifications and other support services to participants, quality work experience and progression into employment.  As both programmes are now under this Department there is greater potential to maximise the outcomes and achieve economies between these programmes and the other Employment Schemes in this Department.</p></reply>

This represents approximately 87% of the total REV allocation for the year.  Current expenditure accounted for just over &euro;204.1m of this total (99% of profile), while capital expenditure accounted for &euro;30.4m (86% of profile). </p><p>  Current expenditure is a little over &euro;2m behind profile, which is a 1% variance against profile.  Capital spending is approximately &euro;5m behind profile, primarily due to certain capital projects progressing at a slightly slower rate than was anticipated.  My Department has sought capital carryover of &euro;1.2m into 2013 in respect of the heritage area.  However, I expect, as with last year, that close to my Department's full programme provision will be utilised and no significant surpluses or deficits are envisaged. </p><p>  I am very committed to ensuring that the maximum value is derived from my Department's budget in terms of maintaining, promoting and protecting Ireland&rsquo;s heritage and culture, developing cultural tourism, advancing the use of the Irish language, and supporting the sustainable development of the islands.  This is reflected in the fact that, in 2011, excluding Departmental administration, my Department expended approximately 99.76% of its available programme funding. </p><p>  I will, of course, continue to closely monitor expenditure trends across all my Department&rsquo;s subheads in the lead up to year-end to ensure the greatest possible use of the resources available.</p></reply>

The European Commission oversees the fulfilment of these obligations through a series of biogeographic seminars, which compare the effort of Member States within a biogeographic region.  Such a seminar in 2009 found that certain habitats and species were insufficiently represented in the list of marine candidate SACs proposed for designation by Ireland.  The designation of marine SACs is scheduled for completion for the entire EU in 2012.  The site referred to by the Deputy is one of six additional sites proposed that will constitute Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to that process.  The harbour porpoise is the principal conservation interest of site in question, while areas of reefs are also afforded protection. </p><p>  Sites proposed for designation invariably have existing consents which allow certain activities or developments within them.  The legal implications of the proposed designation apply certain obligations relating to consents granted after the date of the notification.  I understand that the consent referred to was granted by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government before the date of notification. </p><p>  Like all species of cetacean, harbour porpoise, for which the site in question is to be designated, also enjoys strict protection under the Habitats Directive wherever it occurs.  Potential impacts arising from interventions in the marine environment must be assessed for impacts upon these species.</p><p>  My Department was consulted in advance of the issuing of the consent and provided advice to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the protection of marine mammals, including the harbour porpoise, and on appropriate mitigation measures that should be employed during the seismic survey to be carried out. It is understood that reefs within the proposed SAC will not be affected by the activities allowable under the consent that issued. </p><p>  Any future consent for exploration, extraction or any other activity within or in the vicinity of the SAC will need to be examined for potential impacts upon it.  Consent authorities will need to satisfy themselves that applications do not pose a risk to the site before issuing such consents.</p></reply>

It also recognises the approved housing body sector as a key partner in the delivery of social housing solutions for low-income families and persons with specific categories of housing need.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies (AHBs) for construction and acquisition. In this regard, the Housing Finance Agency has received eighteen applications from AHBs for Certified Borrower status and awarded such status to five bodies, with a number of others currently being assessed. The Agency has approved six applications for 128 social housing units in total (at a valuation of &euro;11.6 million). </p><p>I am conscious that the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by AHBs to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them. I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it by Government and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. My Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse. This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.   </p><p>Under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of accommodation to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need including older people, people with an intellectual, physical or mental health disability, the homeless, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence. My Department&rsquo;s involvement with these voluntary and co-operative housing schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.   </p><p>In early 2012, some &euro;46 million in CAS funding was allocated to local authorities in respect of existing commitments on CAS projects then underway. In   July I announced details of a &euro;35 million programme of special needs housing provision which is intended to deliver some 377 housing units at 55 locations across the country. Approvals were based on local housing need and on the priority afforded to individual proposals by local authorities. </p><p>Projected levels of activity in 2013 will be subject to the financial provision for housing determined in the context of the 2013 Estimates.   </p></reply>

In particular, guidance is given covering the appropriate location of flue terminals for both natural draught and balanced flue appliances, shielding of flue pipes from combustible materials, encasement of flues where passing through compartment walls and floors and the need for provision for flue cleaning. </p><p>The relevant distances for flue locations are based on the European standard EN 15287-1: 2007 Design, Installation and Commissioning of Chimneys - Part 1 Chimneys for non-room sealed heating appliances, which deals with all fuel type appliances.   </p><p>  The distance of not less than 2.3m from an adjoining building as specified in TGD J is therefore in keeping with European standards. </p><p>It is worth noting, however, that the building regulations and European standard referred to above are primarily concerned with ensuring public safety and minimising the risk of fire. Airborne pollution and air-related public nuisance are addressed under the Air Pollution Act 1987. Section 24(2) of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, stipulates that an occupier of any premises must not cause or permit an emission in such a quantity, or in such a manner, as to be a nuisance.   Where it appears necessary in order to prevent or limit air pollution, a local authority may serve a notice on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission. In any prosecution brought against the occupier of a premises causing an emission it is a good defence to establish that the best practicable means have been used to prevent or limit the emission concerned.   </p><p>  Statutory responsibility for the enforcement of the Air Pollution Act, as well as regulations made under the Act, is vested in the relevant local authority, in this case Dublin City Council.   </p><p>  The Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE) of the Environmental Protection Agency supervises the environmental protection activities of local authorities. This function includes supervising the enforcement of air pollution legislation by local authorities. In this regard, the OEE is a resource for members of the public who have exhausted all other avenues in regard to a local authority response to an environmental complaint they have made. </p></reply>

The Local Authorities and the Housing Agency are working systematically with NAMA to determine if there is a social housing demand for properties identified as potentially suitable for social housing, including the need for accommodation for those who are homeless. Where a demand is identified this information is provided to NAMA and efforts are made to secure as many of the suitable properties as possible for social housing. This will continue to be my Department's objective in 2013, to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available. Leasing offers us the most effective and efficient way of doing this more generally, taking account of not just the availability of resources but also market conditions and the need for a broader range of more flexible delivery mechanisms than the traditional methods of social housing provision.   </p></reply>

The Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  In this regard the Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch, as well as more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.</p><p>  Details of the closures are set out in the Policing Plan have for 2013 which is available in the Oireachtas library. The Plan also provides details of the alternative policing arrangements for the areas in question.  The Commissioner has indicated that wherever possible and subject to operational requirements, Gardai attached to a station which is scheduled for closure will be assigned within the local District.</p><p>  We also need to be honest about the level of policing service that was capable of being provided from the stations that were and are to be closed.  Of the 100 stations to be closed next year, 98% are only open part-time, 94% are open for 3 hours a day or less, 88% are served by 1 Garda and only 5% are served by 3 or more Garda personnel.  In fact, of the 39 stations closed this year, 8 were not actually open at all.  Their closure was a paper exercise which simply recognised reality.</p><p>  The implementation of the reduction in the number of Garda stations and Districts will take place in full consultation with the local communities and staffing interests. Local Garda management will shortly commence the process of engaging with these communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the revised policing arrangements for the localities in question. The objective will be to ensure that the best possible policing service will be provided at all times.</p></reply>

To a large extent these estimates relate to heating and lighting costs and they do not take account of specific repair bills, which will vary from premises to premises.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the closure of the two stations has been proposed by the Garda Commissioner in his Policing Plan for 2013 and I would stress that the key objective involved is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  In this context the Commissioner has concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  </p><p>  In making his recommendations on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  In addition, the Commissioner has given a commitment that where a station is to be closed local Garda management will consult with local communities on the alternative policing arrangements to be put in place in their area.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that regard he has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.

The issue he has raised is a matter for the Board.  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board on his behalf.</p><p>  I am advised that the Legal Aid Board has a full time Law Centre in Nenagh. The Centre is among a number of centres piloting an &lsquo;early legal advice&rsquo; or &lsquo;triage&rsquo; service. The objective of this service is to ensure that every applicant gets to see, within one month of their application, a solicitor for a legal advice appointment lasting no more than 45 minutes. </p><p>  The Centre is meeting this commitment at the moment. Applicants who require further services are currently waiting for approximately five months (from the date of their original application). The Centre operates part-time offices in Thurles and Clonmel also. The waiting times are similar to the Centre in Nenagh. The waiting time was approximately 10 months at the start of the year but this has reduced considerably during the course of this year.</p><p>  In addition to the above, I am informed that the Legal Aid Board provides a priority service in cases where it considers that an immediate, or near immediate, service was needed. These include cases of domestic violence, child abduction, cases involving applications by the State to take children into care, and cases that have statutory time limits close to expiry.</p></reply>

Despite the challenging budgetary constraints I secured a budget of &euro;20 million to provide for the new AEOS III, with a view to accepting approximately 6,000 applicants into the scheme.  </p><p>  The Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS III) will build on the success of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual payment to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards.  </p><p>  A maximum payment of &euro;4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the scheme.  It will operate largely on the same basis as in previous years and the same measures and rates of payment will be available. Farmers with commonage land, designated Special Areas of Conservation or Special Protection Areas will be required to follow a 'Sustainable Management Plan' prepared by a planner. However, those applicants will be given priority in determining access to the scheme.  Applicants other than those requiring a sustainable management plan will not be required to engage a planner to complete their application form.  In addition to the priority which will be given to designated land applications will be assessed on the basis of selection criteria reflecting previous participation in REPS, farm size and location in Disadvantaged Areas. </p><p>  Application forms, Terms and Conditions and Specification documents were made available in local AES offices Department and on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The website also contained a Guidance Note for completing the Sustainable Management Plan and clarification notes on the scheme.  The closing date for receipt of applications was fixed at 30th November 2012 with a view to allowing applicants adequate time to prepare and submit applications under the scheme and, following the processing of those applications, to allow for the entry of new participants as soon as possible.  Due to a high level of interest in the AEOS 3 Scheme I decided to extend the closing date for receipt of AEOS III applications by one week to Friday, 7th December 2012.  The extension was granted to allow necessary time for both farmers and planners to complete work on hands and to return the completed applications to the Department Office in Johnstown Castle Estate, Wexford.</p><p>  Approximately 10,000 have been submitted and all applications received will now be processed and assessed with a view to issuing approvals to successful applicants as soon as possible.</p></reply>

However, to do this, three things need to happen:</p><p>- there must be agreement on the MFF as soon as possible,</p><p>- there must be substantial progress during previous presidencies on technical issues,</p><p>- all three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - need to engage actively in the negotiating process.</p><p>  The CAP reform dossier comprises seven legislative proposals in all.  These have been the subject of detailed examination by the Council over the last year, in Working Groups, the Special Committee on Agriculture and the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers.  Good progress has been made by the Danish and Cyprus Presidency on many of the technical issues and we are now approaching the point at which the more political issues fall to be decided. </p><p>  However, a number of CAP reform issues, relating, primarily but not exclusively, to financial matters, fall to be decided by Heads of State and Government in the context of the negotiations on the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework for the EU budget.  It is expected that Heads of State and Government will return to the MFF negotiations early in the new year, following on their discussion on 22/23 November.  If they reach agreement, it will provide a window for finalisation of a Council position on CAP reform.</p><p>  The CAP reform dossier falls to be decided in full co-decision with the European Parliament.  Thus, in parallel with the Council, the European Parliament is conducting a detailed examination of the dossier.  The rapporteurs assigned to each of the legislative proposals produced draft reports in May and June last.  These were the subject of some 7,000 amendments and the Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Agriculture (COMAGRI) is scheduled to vote on these amendments in January next. These amendments will subsequently be voted upon in a plenary session of the Parliament, which is tentatively scheduled for the week beginning 11 March. This will give a mandate to COMAGRI to enter into Trilogue discussions with the Council and the Commission.  Trilogues are the platform through which final agreement is reached between the three institutions. </p><p>  In these circumstances, there is a narrow window of opportunity for securing political agreement on CAP reform in the first six months of next year during the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  I should add that my own national priorities in these negotiations remain unchanged.  These are to get the best possible outcome for Ireland, focusing on five key areas:</p><p>- delivering a well-resourced CAP,</p><p>- retaining Ireland&rsquo;s share of CAP funds,</p><p>- maximising payment model flexibility for Member States,</p><p>- ensuring rural development policy supports competitiveness and sustainability, and</p><p>- keeping the CAP as simple and as effective as possible for farmers and Member States.</p></reply>

The amount of funding available for payment to Irish farmers under the 2011 and 2012 Schemes was &euro;1.263 billion and &euro;1.255 billion respectively. These funds were used to pay the Single Farm Payment and the Article 68 Schemes namely the Grassland Sheep Scheme, the Dairy Efficiency Programme and the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme.</p><p>  Given the level of the funding involved annually and the importance of the monies paid to farmers&rsquo; income, it is absolutely vital that all of the funding available from the EU is fully drawn down and utilised.  Therefore, it is my priority that payments be maximised, both for the benefit of the individual farmers concerned and, on a broader level, the benefit of the country in general.</p><p>  Essentially, the linear reductions to payments under both the 2011 and 2012 Single Payment Schemes are necessary in order to ensure that the National Ceilings for the Scheme for the years in question are respected.</p><p>  However, in pursuing this objective, the budget for the 2011 Scheme was marginally exceeded and the projections for the budget for the 2012 Scheme are similar. In light of this, the only prudent course of action is to apply linear reductions to both years&rsquo; payments.  These reductions, at a rate of 0.45% on the payments made, are being applied to the balancing payments now issuing under the 2012 Scheme.  The reductions are applicable to all Single Payment Scheme beneficiaries.</p><p>  There are technical issues involved in relation to the overshoot of the National Ceiling, in that under the EU Commission requirements it is necessary payments under earlier SPS schemes must be accounted in the year in which they are paid. My Department&rsquo;s officials are pursuing this matter with the Commission.</p><p>  Turning to payments in respect of the 2012 SPS Scheme, I am delighted with the level of payments that have been made by my Department since balancing payments commenced less than two weeks ago. In what has been a difficult year for farmers due to the impact of the weather conditions, over &euro;1,193 million was paid to 121,290 farmers (or over 98% of all applicants).  Payments continue to be made as soon as cleared of errors and fully processed.</p></reply>

Article 10 of the Council Regulation provided for the application of a modulation deduction of 3% in 2005, 4% in 2006 and 5% from 2005 onwards.</p><p>  Under the original SPS provisions, the modulation deduction was applied to all payments and was subsequently refunded on the first &euro;5,000 in each payment or up to the amount paid if it was less than &euro;5,000. This was provided for under the provisions of Article 12 of the Council Regulation.  After the adoption of the Health Check proposals, the first &euro;5,000 of SPS payments is exempt from the modulation deduction from the 2009 SPS scheme-year onwards.  New rates of modulation deductions applied after agreement on the Health Check proposals &ndash; 7% in 2009, 8% in 2010, 9% in 2011 and 10% from 2012 onwards. A further 4% deduction applies to payments made in excess of &euro;300,000. This provision only applies to five applicants in Ireland.</p><p>  Most of the amounts not paid arising from the modulation deduction (90% in 2011) are made available to Ireland for funding Rural Development (Pillar 11) measures. The Commission&rsquo;s proposals for funding of the Common Agricultural Policy for the period from 2014 to 2020 foresee that the modulated amounts transfer permanently to fund Rural Development (Pillar 11) from the commencement of the new programming period.</p></reply>

The profile which is the best estimate of expenditure available at that time is difficult to forecast and may vary significantly during the year for a variety of reasons, such as the level of payments under demand led schemes, the pattern of draw-down of Grants-in-Aid by State bodies, etc.  </p><p>  The data published in the Exchequer return quoted in the question was prepared by my Department towards the end of November and was based on anticipated expenditure to the end of the month. The variation on net expenditure was &euro;103m, arising mainly due to the fact that substantial payments under REPS scheduled for the last days of November actually issued in early December. The divergence between profiled and actual expenditure is due to the fact that, for a variety of reasons, a number of other budget lines were also behind profile at the end of November. </p><p>  I expect that in most cases expenditure will &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; before the end of the year.

The SCP aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort. The SCP is a key programme under the Department of Education and Skills' DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan.</p><p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that &euro;26.456m is being allocated to the programme in 2013. This compares with an allocation of &euro;28.256m in 2012. The allocation is in line with the proposals in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for savings of 6.5% per annum in the SCP in each of the years 2012-2014. </p><p>  In September 2012, the Local Management Committee responsible for each individual project was notified that a reduction on last year&rsquo;s allocation would apply for the coming academic cycle. The full year budget for the SCP was confirmed earlier than in previous years to assist local committees to effectively refine programmes and deliver targeted interventions within budget. </p><p>  Each Committee was requested to review its Retention Plan to support young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage in their school, home and community life,  to remain in education and to finalise a programme of supports to effectively target available resources to meet local needs. Projects were advised to scrutinise all elements of expenditure and to seek to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies while prioritising evidence based services to support children&rsquo;s educational outcomes.</p><p>  The NEWB, which is responsible for the operational management and direction of the SCP, has made assistance available to each local project to review its planned programme. The NEWB continues to work closely with management committees, schools and local SCP co-ordinators to ensure student supports are tailored to meet local needs. </p><p>  The adjustment identified in CRE for 2013 and 2014 will be further considered in the context of a review of the programme to be undertaken in 2013. This review will address the potential to achieve greater consistency in programme delivery, administration and other costs amongst the 124 local projects and related initiatives.</p><p>  A core objective of the review will be to ensure that available funds are appropriately targeted to support those most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</p></reply>

Investment in early childhood care and education benefits not only the individual child but also the wider economy. In recognition of this, considerable funding is already provided by my Department through the provision of three childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme - to assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.   </p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low to middle incomes.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, low and middle income working parents may qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &#8364;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs.  </p><p>The CETS<b></b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.    Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.    </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free pre-school provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.</p><p>  In 2012, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes is expected to be in the region of &#8364;240 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.    </p><p>  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age childcare initiative which will provide further additional support to both the community and private childcare sector. This initiative, which represents an annual investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  </p><p>  My Department has begun work on Ireland&#8217;s first Early Years Strategy which is an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&#8217;s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.    This Strategy, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013, will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development, and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early years experience in Ireland.</p></reply>

The reports of the independent evaluation of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Development Fund (2008-2009) and (2009-2010) highlight the value of the support, information and training provided by the three regional Participation Officers.

They also note the important role played by these officers in creating a strong link between child and youth councils at local level and my Department at national level.</p><p>  In addition to their direct work with organisers of the 34 child and youth councils, the DCYA Participation Officers were involved in the planning and management of a wide range of children&rsquo;s participation initiatives including consultations with children and young people on Reform of the Junior Cycle, the National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Strategy (2013-2017) and the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in Primary Schools.</p><p>500 teenagers from the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g around the country attended the first-ever Comhairle na n&Oacute;g National Showcase on Friday, 9 November 2012.</p><p>  On the day there were four TOPIC ZONES run by key decision-makers where young people could seek advice and support on how to become more effective improving the lives of young people in relation to mental health, sexual health, youth facilities and engaging with Decision Makers.</p><p>  My Department provides opportunities for children and young people to contribute their views on issues of national and personal importance, and has conducted national consultations/dialogues with children and young people on a range of issues, including: the Taskforce on Active Citizenship (2006); the age of consent for sexual activity (2006); the Irish Youth Justice Strategy (2007);the misuse of alcohol among young people (2007) and Teenage Mental Health: What Helps and What Hurts (2008).</p><p>  A Thematic Group on the development of a national policy on children and young people&rsquo;s participation in decision-making was established in  2011, comprising representatives of Government Departments, State Agencies, the research community and other key stakeholders. Its work will feed into the National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework (2013-2017).</p></reply>

Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  </p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated childcare infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.</p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is pro-active in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable it to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.</p><p>  I understand that there has been reduction in funding by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to City and County Childcare Committees in some areas.  The HSE has, however, confirmed that it will endeavour to support the CCCs wherever possible. I have asked my Department to engage further with the Committees and the HSE and to provide a report to me on this matter.</p><p>  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to the seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations, who provide support at a local level to their members. </p><p>  Of the childminders covered by the Regulations, 257 had notified the HSE at the end of 2011, the last full year for which figures are available and also at that date, 1,250 childminders not covered by the Regulations had voluntarily notified the HSE. </p></reply>

Under the terms of the ECCE programme, the pre-school leaders delivering the programme must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  My Department has part-subsidised on-line courses, developed by one of the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations, for unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who wish to achieve a level 5 award.</p><p>  In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  One of the requirements for the higher capitation is that the pre-school leader holds a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of a full level 7 award on the NFQ.</p><p>  I have been successful in maintaining the ECCE programme as a free and universal programme despite the reduced funding available to my Department.  Funding of &euro;176 million is being made available this year to ensure that the increased cohort of eligible children have access to a quality free pre-school year.  </p></reply>

This support is provided through the provision of three childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  </p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, middle and low income working parents may also qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &#8364;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs.  Parents who do not qualify under the programme are expected to pay the full economic cost of providing the service. </p><p>The CETS<b></b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.    Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.    </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free pre-school provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.</p><p>  In 2012, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes is expected to be in the region  &#8364;240 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.    </p><p>  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age childcare initiative which will provide further additional support to both the community and private childcare sector. This initiative, which represents an annual investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  </p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland.</p></reply>

These settings  include:</p><p>- primary care through GPs and community pharmacies;</p><p>- satellite clinics that facilitate opioid substitution provision through community pharmacies;</p><p>- treatment centres where opioid substitution treatment is dispensed on site; and</p><p>- residential rehabilitation facilities. </p><p>  The HSE recognises that drug treatment is best provided at the lowest level of complexity, matching the patient's needs and as close to the patient's home as possible. There are currently 52 clinics within the four Dublin Local Authority Areas of which only 6 are based in the city centre.  The city centre clinics cater for 1,082 people which is less than a quarter of the overall Dublin figure.   85% of those availing of services in the Dublin city centre clinics are from the local area.  </p><p>  The HSE has  reviewed waiting lists for opioid substitution treatment over the past few years with a view to maximising the utilisation of existing services and developing new services where required.  I support the provision  of services in local communities but some concentration of services in Dublin city centre is needed in view of the number of clients from these areas, the fact that some people wish to avail of services outside their local area and the need to provide services for some people who have more complex needs.  This approach is in line with that in many EU countries.  </p><p>  HSE clinics, as well as a number of voluntary service providers, have &quot;good neighbour&quot; policies and protocols in place and a strong focus on inter-agency working.  Some provide a range of outreach and drop-in services to encourage engagement with a view to moving more people into treatment.  C.C.TV is used at some centres to monitor movements and as an aid towards deterring anti-social behaviour.  Drug treatment centres also work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the aim of minimising any potential problems.</p></reply>

The greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing,  for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum. Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the Council is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 Clinical Biochemists to 5,550  Social Care Workers, which amounts to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The Council has extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act,  and considers the annual fee of &euro;295 the minimum required to enable it to operate. The fee charged by the Council, which takes account of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015,  is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  The State is currently funding the Council in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.</p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the Council has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:</p><p>-  where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting,  the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting. This concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;</p><p>- The Council has entered into discussions with the HSE in regard to the feasibility of  arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;</p><p>- Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system and keep costs to a minimum. This will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

In line with measures announced in the Budget, the income limits are being reduced to &euro;600 a week for an individual and &euro;1,200 a week for a couple.  This will mean that a single person with an income under &euro;600 per week or a couple with an income under &euro;1,200 per week, will still qualify for a medical card. If a single person has an income of between &euro;600 and &euro;700 per week, or a couple has an income of between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,400 per week, they will qualify for a GP visit card instead of a medical card.</p><p>  It is estimated that these changes will affect about 20,000 persons out of 360,000 over-70's medical card holders.

Firstly, the asset contribution will be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  This will be capped at three years, or 22.5%, in the case of the principal private residence.  This change will apply to both new and existing nursing home residents.  However, for existing residents, it should be noted that, in the case of the principal private residence, the higher percentage will only apply for the time remaining of the three year cap. In the case of all other assets, it will apply for as long as the person remains in receipt of financial support under the Scheme.</p><p>Secondly, the entitlement for State support to be backdated to the 27th October 2009 for people who were in nursing home care prior to the Scheme commencing will be abolished.</p><p>  It is important to note that the legislation underpinning the Scheme must be amended before these measures can be implemented.  Therefore, an effective date will be announced in 2013.</p><p>  Finally, the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will proceed as planned.  A considerable amount of preparatory work for the review has already been completed.  It will progress within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed in 2013.</p></reply>

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.  Reform across the three domains of access, quality and resources is not achievable unless there is real clinical and managerial accountability at hospital level.</p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals.  It is about the bringing together groups of hospitals to form single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery.  Hospital groups will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2014.  Before those trusts are established the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.</p><p>  Last June I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups.  The Strategic Board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.  A Project Team was established to make recommendations to the Strategic Board on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions.</p><p>  The Project Team is currently finalising a Report on the recommendations outlined above, taking account of the observations and comments made by the Strategic Board at their meeting on 14th November.  It is anticipated that this work will be completed within the next few days.  Upon completion, the finalised Report will be submitted to me and I will then bring it to Cabinet.  The composition of Hospital groups will be a Government decision, taking into account the recommendations of that Report.</p></reply>
