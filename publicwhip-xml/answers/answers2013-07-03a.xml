In each case an individual tutor is sanctioned by my Department.  In a small number of cases however there will be more than one child in the family who are eligible for home tuition.  In these circumstances a combined allocation is made to qualifying siblings.</p><p>  One-to-one provision therefore is not an entitlement of the scheme but is reflective of the fact that the tuition is provided in the qualifying child's home. </p><p>Home based tuition is intended to compensate for the absence of school based provision where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils. It is therefore appropriate that a tutor can provide collective tuition to siblings following individualised programmes in the home at the same time in the same way that a teacher can provide collective tuition in a classroom.  </p></reply>

I am a strong believer in the value of good comparative international data as one source of information among many to support informed policy making in education. </p><p>  The report is an extensive one, covering a wide range of themes including educational completion rates, educational expenditure, the social gains from education and school characteristics, based mainly on data up to the 2010-11 school year. </p><p>  Several positive achievements of the Irish educational system are evident in the report.  We have higher completion rates to the end of second level education than other countries for the 25-34 year age group in the OECD (Ireland: 85%; OECD 82%) and completion of third level education among the 25-34 year group  was particularly high here (Ireland - 47%; OECD - 39%). Expenditure per student at all levels of education in Ireland was above the OECD average.  The report shows our PTR and class sizes in primary schools to be broadly in line with the OECD average: the PTR is 15.7: 1 in Ireland just above the OECD average of 15.4:1 and average class sizes are shown as 23.9 versus 21.3 across the OECD. </p></reply>

The contribution is paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under my Department's student grant scheme. </p><p>  I have no intention to go beyond the previously announced &euro;250 increase for the students in the forthcoming Budget.</p><p>  The Higher Education Authority (HEA) is also undertaking a study on the sustainability of the current funding system for higher education.  This study was initiated at my request and an initial report has been published.  This report makes it clear that immediate work is required to prepare for a longer term approach to a system that can be maintained through a sustainable funding base capable of addressing the continual expansion of the sector while protecting quality of education.  The HEA is continuing its work in this area, which will help inform the decision-making as to the future funding of the sector and I will be advised further as this work progresses. </p></reply>

The system opened for applications three weeks earlier also.   The decision to bring forward the opening and closing dates was taken in consultation with my Department and was implemented to facilitate earlier decisions on grant applications.</p><p>  Guidance Counsellors were, in fact, informed by SUSI of the change of closing date.  SUSI announced the change in its presentation to the Annual Conference of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors in March this year.  In addition, SUSI contacted its own database of guidance councillors who registered for the &quot;Student Grants Information Week&quot; initiative.  Finally, a senior representative of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors is a member of the SUSI stakeholders' Advisory Group and updated all members on these developments.</p></reply>

There continues to be a strong correlation between educational attainment and unemployment. The data in the OECD report referred to by the Deputy focus on the situation in 2011. In particular, the report says that the unemployment rate in 2011 was 7.1% for people with a third level education, 15% for those with a Leaving Certificate and 21.7% for those with below upper secondary attainment.</p><p>  The report is a timely reminder of the scale of the unemployment  crisis created under the last Government.   It is worth remembering that in the three years to March 2011 a net 250,000 jobs were lost in the private sector in Ireland under the last Fianna Fail - Green Party Government. We are rebuilding our economy brick-by-brick, making it stronger, ensuring that successes gained are here for the long term.</p><p>  Since entering into office, the current Government is working very hard to tackle all forms of unemployment, particularly the unfortunate trends in long-term unemployment and youth unemployment. We have developed detailed strategies on several fronts - the Pathways to Work plan will help activate the long-term unemployed and the Action Plan for Jobs will, I hope, help create the right conditions for job creation within the economy. More recently, the Irish Presidency of the European Union oversaw the agreement of an &euro;8bn fund to help tackle youth unemployment across all Member States.</p><p>  Within the field of education, I have worked hard to increase the number of retraining places available. A number of enterprise-targeted focus education and training schemes are available to jobseekers and the Government intends to bring them under one umbrella brand  called Skills Plus. Skills Plus covers the Springboard, ICT Skills Conversion, Momentum, JobBridge and the Skillnets Jobseeker programmes. All of these initiatives have been introduced since 2011 and provide for targeted upskilling and reskilling programmes of one year or less in duration that are focused on the skills needs of industry. Almost 30,000 places are being provided for jobseekers across the full range of programmes in 2013. Further information on the range of Skills Plus programmes is available at www.skillsplus.ie</p></reply>

However the alternative was to adjust the PTR staffing allocations. The budget decision sheltered the impact for all DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations - a fact which is often overlooked in this debate.</p><p>  Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level. The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support. </p><p> In addition, my Department published Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention, which I launched jointly with Minister Kathleen Lynch last January.  The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p></reply>

A particular challenge in the education sector is the on-going significant increases in demographics across all levels which are resulting in a requirement for up to 900 additional teachers in the coming school year.  I acknowledge the challenges faced by schools in managing the overall impact of budgetary measures over the last 4 years. Budget 2012 provided for an overall reduction of 2% in the funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools in 2012 and 2013 and a further reduction of 1% in 2014 and 2015. In the most recent budget the Government confined staffing measures to the fee-charging sector and protected schools in the free scheme from any changes in pupil-teacher ratios. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools was also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. </p></reply>

While this letter did not request the NCSE to delay communicating this decision to schools, in a follow up discussion between my officials and the NCSE, my officials requested that the announcement of the Resource Teacher and Special Needs Assistant allocations would be made at the same time, as had happened the previous year.  The NCSE initially published details of the allocations for SNAs and resource teaching hours for the 2013-14 school year on Wednesday, 19 June last.

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers.  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.  There has been no reduction in the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year.  This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support.</p><p>  It is important to note that the level of SNAs required to support children with special educational needs changes from year to year in line with the enrolment of different children with different care needs.  The care needs of individual children can also change from year to year. The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.  Therefore, even if the number of students receiving SNA support rises, this does not necessarily mean that the required number of SNAs to support their care needs should rise by a similar percentage.  In June 2012 the NCSE reported that the number of children requiring support for the 2012/2013 school year was in the order of 20,000 and the most up-to-date current figures is that for December 2012 of 21,972. </p><p>  The initial allocation of SNAs for the coming school year will support about 22,000 pupils. This is at about the same level supported in December 2012, despite the passing of 6 months. </p><p>To date the NCSE has allocated over 10,490 SNA posts to schools which leaves over 80 posts available for allocation during the school year. The NCSE has advised that they have processed all applications for SNA support this year and have allocated the level of SNA support to schools that it considers will meet the care needs of all qualifying pupils. These allocations have been made in line with DES policy and there has been no change in the policy or its application this year.</p><p>  Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE for the 2013/2014 school year are now available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of the SNA allocations for each school on a school by school and per county basis.</p></reply>

This is a very significant report which is based on a review of best practice in both national and international research and follows a wide process of consultation with children with Special Educational Needs, parents, representative groups, educational partners, voluntary bodies and advocacy groups.  The report refers to the limited availability of assessments in some areas and indicated that there was parental concern with regard to the assessment process and the waiting time for health or educational assessments. </p><p>The report found that a serious consequence of the limited access to professional assessment is that access to supports which require an assessment to trigger a support may become dependent on the ability of the parent or the school to fund private assessments and that some schools and parents have greater capacity to source private reports. The report concludes that diagnosis should not be a prerequisite or determinant for the allocation of additional resources for a child or young person with special educational needs which should instead be based on the needs of the child, irrespective of category of disability. Instead, greater use should be made of school-based data and school performance in decision-making related to resource allocation.</p><p>One of the principal recommendations of the policy advice is that a new model should be developed for the allocation of additional teaching resources to mainstream schools, based on the profiled need of each school, which will ensure that a more equitable resource allocation system will be in place for students, which will be based on their educational needs as opposed to being based primarily on a diagnosis of disability.  I have requested the NCSE to proceed immediately to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration in relation to a revised allocation mechanism.</p></reply>

The Report covers all aspects of Traveller Education from pre-school right through to further and higher education within a lifelong learning context. The primary aim of the report is to ensure a quality, integrated education for Travellers underpinned by the principles of inclusion and mainstreaming with an emphasis on equality and diversity and the adoption of an intercultural approach. In keeping with the recommendations of this report allocation of resources is underpinned by the principle of "individual educational need" rather than "Traveller identity".  In line with this approach the majority of recommendations in relation to mainstreaming of educational provision have been implemented at this stage.

Both Frameworks are based upon extensive research evidence on best practice in early childhood education and care and also have been developed through extensive consultation with all interested parties including parents, teachers, the broad range of staff working in early childhood care and education settings and children themselves. Implementation of these Frameworks to date has involved: Raising awareness of the contents of each framework though publication and dissemination of information, e.g., S&iacute;olta and Aistear manuals and guidelines; Aistear tip sheets for parents; Aistear Toolkit (online); Collaboration with City and County Childcare Committees, Voluntary Childcare Organisations in the development and delivery of the S&iacute;olta Quality; Assurance Programme field test.  This was a unique collaboration across Voluntary Childcare Organisations and other agencies all of whom worked with my Department in developing a mentoring model for the implementation of S&iacute;olta.  Establishment of the Aistear in Action Initiative (a collaboration between NCCA and Early Childhood Ireland).  The Aistear Tutor Initiative (a collaboration between NCCA and the network of Education Centres).  This Initiative will see 26 summer courses on Aistear available to primary teachers through the Education Centres.  Given that the implementation of S&iacute;olta and Aistear had to be done within existing resources, I am satisfied that these resources were utilised to the maximum extent possible.</p></reply>

While this policy document is in preparation, the Deputy is assured that national policy for the education of children with autism is being fully implemented in a timely and consistent manner.  My Department's policy on the education of children with Autism resides within the overall policies on the education of children with special educational needs. In the main these policies are not condition-specific. In this context, the Autism policy, whether expressed in a multiple of documents or in a single document, should not be viewed as a separate 'stand alone' policy. The new policy statement will not be exclusive. Policies are subject of necessity to change from time to time. Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents.  As the Deputy is aware I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015. The time frame required is reflective of the wide consultation process which will be a feature of the preparation of the advice.  I have specifically requested the NCSE to consult widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties.  Furthermore the NCSE has commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice. It is for these reasons that the advice is not expected until 2015.  </p></reply>

It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy in deciding whether to recommend their pupils purchase e-books and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice over the medium and long terms.  In making this decision, each school should consider all the available information and in this regard the Professional Development Service for Teachers, which now incorporates the ICT in Schools function, is available to advise schools.

The VECs were dissolved on 1 July last and were replaced with Education and Training Boards (ETBs).</p><p>  The new ETBs will strengthen locally managed education and enhance the scale of local education and training.

The new configuration paves the way for exciting new provisions that will provide for the establishment of SOLAS, the dissolution of F&Aacute;S and the transfer of training functions to the newly formed Education and Training Boards.  </p><p>In October 2011, I decided on the headquarter locations for the new ETBs.  In relation to the merger of Co. Dublin VEC with Dun Laoghaire VEC, I decided that the headquarters for the new ETB will be in Tallaght.  In arriving at this decision, I considered a range of factors including the need to ensure that the location of a VEC headquarters will, to the greatest extent possible, facilitate staff redeployment under a redeployment scheme within the context of the Croke Park Agreement and the need to operate at lowest cost having regard to the accommodation available in existing locations.</p><p>  In terms of these criteria, I was aware that redeployment of staff from Dun Laoghaire to Tallaght is possible under the Croke Park agreement.  However, I expect that the offices in Dun Laoghaire will remain open for some time and that the approach to redeployment will be measured and considered.

Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks.  I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.  The Association responded positively to my approaches and agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members.  The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments.  The Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012 and the same level of funding will be provided in 2013. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I launched new &quot;Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools&quot; on the 28th January last.  These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.</p><p>  The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department, and which I published in May 2012.  This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme.  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country.  I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  </p><p>A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.</p><p>  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape.</p><p>  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.</p><p>  Educational book publishers are independent private companies not under the direct control of my Department.

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers. </p><p>These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position. The ongoing commitment of my Government to protect frontline supports for children with special educational needs is an acknowledgment of the important role played by SNAs and resource teachers in ensuring that children with special needs can progress and develop and be included, where appropriate, in mainstream school settings.</p><p>  Whereas the allocations of SNA support for individual schools may change each year in line with a schools enrolment of children with care needs, there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support. </p><p>  The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012/13 school year was 10,487 posts. For the 2011/12 school year it was 10,320 posts. The demand for SNAs for the 2013/2104 school year currently stands at 10,490 leaving some 85 posts available for late demand. It is therefore estimated that there will be sufficient SNA posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such support in the coming school year.</p><p>In relation to the allocation of resource teaching support for schools from September 2013, demand for support has risen again this year, due to a combination of demographic growth and increased assessments.</p><p>  Despite the fact that the overall number of posts available to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for allocation to schools had been maintained at existing levels, the allocations initially announced by the NCSE on 19th June were reduced to take into account of the growth in demand, within the maintained number of posts, in order to ensure that equivalent allocations could be made for all qualifying children.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I announced recently that I have now authorised the NCSE to restore the level of resource teaching allocations which can be provided for students with special educational needs to the 2012/13 levels. This will mean that there will not now be any reduction to resource teaching time for children on the level which applied last year.</p><p>  I also committed to ensuring that the resources which will be required to ensure that the allocations can be made to schools at existing levels will be provided, including resources required to meet any late demand expected to arise between now and the start of the school year.  The NCSE has now published revised details of the Resource Teaching allocations for all schools, based on existing allocation levels. Details of these allocations are now provided at www.ncse.ie. </p><p>  I am concerned that the scale of increased demand for resource teachers this year, if it were to continue, would make the current system unsustainable.</p><p>I am asking the NCSE to consider the reasons for the unprecedented 12 per cent rise in applications for resource teacher support this year, which compares with an annual 1.3 per cent increase in the number of students attending school in the current year. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools.</p><p>  I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.</p><p>In the interim, I wish to ensure that children will not be disadvantaged while we move towards a new model which will ensure greater fairness and quality of education for children with special educational needs.

Universities and institutes of technology are autonomous statutory bodies and the recruitment of students is a matter for the individual institutions concerned. The International Education Strategy has a particular focus on recruiting students from priority markets outside of the EU, including the USA, China, India Brazil and the Gulf but individual institutions are free to focus their recruitment efforts on any country or region.</p><p>  While CAO applications from students in Northern Ireland have been increasing in recent years, including a 40% increase since 2011, very small numbers of the students from Northern Ireland who apply through the CAO subsequently enrol in higher education institutions in the south. There are a number of reasons for this including a concentration in demand for a small number of programmes such as medicine for which there is a very high overall level of demand, and a lower rate of acceptance by students in Northern Ireland of places in Irish universities compared to Leaving Certificate students.</p><p>My Department engages with Northern Ireland's Department of Employment and Learning on a regular basis to discuss issues of mutual interest, including cross border student mobility.</p></reply>

Such quality learning will be described through 24 statements of learning.  Schools will design their programmes to reflect teacher qualifications and students' identified needs. All junior cycle students will be required to study English, Irish and maths and thereafter schools will have the flexibility and authonomy to choose from 18 other subjects, including History and Geography, and short courses. </p><p>  The vast majority of schools already offer History and Geography and the vast majority of students choose these subjects although they are currently compulsory in only half our schools.  The popularity of subjects depends on the quality of teaching, the passion of the teachers for their subjects and the engagement of their students. I see no reason why  the popularity of History and Geography will change in the future. Overall, I am in favour of leaving the decision on what is offered at the discretion of the school. Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.</p></reply>

It is also worth pointing out that, as part of last year's budgetary measures, my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations - a fact which is often overlooked in this debate.</p><p>  Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level. The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support. </p><p>  In addition, my Department published Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention, which I launched jointly with Minister Kathleen Lynch last January.  The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p></reply>

While the percentage spend reduced significantly to 9.7% in 2010 the main driver of this reduction was the very large increase in public expenditure recorded in 2010 over 2009 as a result of very significant capital transfers to Irish banks arising from the recapitalisation programme. </p><p>  Alternatively, data for expenditure on education when expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) reflects the continued importance placed on education and its role in building a knowledge based economy.

My Department takes account of the concerns expressed. In regard to the staffing schedule, how best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities does present as a particular challenge especially in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby. The Government is intent on fostering pluralism in school provision.  Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy. In regard to the Value for Money Review, it takes account of the ethos of schools, the locations of small schools  relative to other schools of a similar type. I recently received the report of the Review and am currently considering it.</p></reply>

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers. </p><p>  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position. The ongoing commitment of my Government to protecting front-line supports for children with special educational needs is an acknowledgment of the important role played by SNAs and resource teachers in ensuring that children with special needs can progress and develop and be included in mainstream school settings.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools.</p><p>  The NCSE have now published their policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which is available on the website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>  In preparing this policy advice the NCSE consulted widely with parents of children with special educational needs, representative bodies and the education partners.</p><p>The NCSE Report is clear that there are many aspects of the current system which parents and schools are very happy with. However, the NCSE also considers that there are concerns in relation to some aspects of our current system, under the headings of Enrolment, Assessments, and the Supports for children with Special Educational Needs and their allocation. The Report makes 28 detailed recommendations which the NCSE feels would help to address these issues. The recommendations in the Report are both interesting and significant. They deserve in-depth and detailed examination and exploration. Accordingly, I have asked my Department to carefully review the recommendations and report back to me on them. </p><p>  The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>  I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.</p><p>In the interim, I wish to ensure that children will not be disadvantaged while we move towards a new model which will ensure greater fairness and quality of education for children with special educational needs. That is why I have made the decision to maintain the existing allocation levels this year.</p></reply>

Some of the provisions of the Treaty concern matters that fall within the exclusive competence of the European Union, as they come under the scope of the Common Commercial Policy or affect the rules of the Internal Market.  As a result, a Decision authorising member States to ratify must be adopted by the Council before Ireland and its EU partners can proceed to ratification.</p><p>  A proposal to the Council recommending the adoption of a draft Council Decision is awaited from the European Commission in this regard.  The Commission will set out its assessment of the legal position, including whether any European legal instruments need to be amended in order to comply with the terms of the Treaty.  Any changes in European legislation identified by the Commission may require corresponding changes in domestic legislation transposing the relevant European laws.  This would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, whose Department operates Ireland&rsquo;s national licensing unit.</p><p>  At the national level, I have instructed officials in my Department to begin preparations to ensure that the necessary steps are taken in good time to allow for early ratification. We are considering what measures, if any, must be taken so that the State will be in a position to meet the obligations it will assume under the Treaty as soon as it enters into force.  This involves an examination of the provisions of the Treaty to establish whether legislative, administrative and-or policy measures are required to implement them.  Contacts are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in this regard.  Early ratification by the 28 EU member States, including Ireland, would advance matters considerably toward the ATT becoming a reality on the ground and starting to save lives.  I therefore hope that the necessary steps can be taken quickly.</p></reply>

Freedom of expression is an issue which is discussed regularly with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral and multilateral meetings.

The Strategic Partnership reaffirms the commitment of Ireland and China to respecting and safeguarding human rights.</p><p>  As indicated in the joint statement, Ireland and China will conduct exchanges of expertise in governance and rule of law on the basis of equality and mutual respect.  Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 25 June 2013 and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, deprivation of liberty, and criminal and administrative punishment.</p><p>  At this meeting, the EU also asked about measures taken so far by China to ratify the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, signed in 1998 in view of China&rsquo;s undertaking made during the 2009 Universal Periodic Review (UPR) to ratify the Covenant at an early date.

This is a very positive development that takes us another step closer towards addressing the problems faced by undocumented Irish emigrants in the US and will allow them to emerge from the shadows.  I strongly welcome the provisions in the Bill passed by the Senate to address the concerns of our undocumented and the specific E3 provisions for Ireland that provide extensive legal pathway for future migration flows between Ireland and the US.  </p><p>  I am particularly pleased that the Bill includes provisions that will allow for continuation of the summer J1 visa programme.  Earlier drafts of the bill had threatened the future viability of the programme.  I raised these concerns directly with Senator Patrick Leahy, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  I am pleased that the Bill as passed by the Senate no longer classifies J1 summer participants as foreign workers, which would have imposed significant additional requirements on them and their potential employers.  Earlier texts had also proposed a further fee of $500 to be paid by the sponsoring organisations; the Bill as passed introduces a fee of $100, and the conditions surrounding payment of this fee would allow for it to be paid by either the sponsoring organisation or the participant.</p><p>  I pay tribute to hard work and persistence of Senators Leahy, Schumer, McCain and other members of the US Senate bi-partisan group who brought forward the original proposals.  I also welcome the considerable bi-partisan support that has emerged in support of the Senate bill and hope that this bodes well for its further prospects. </p><p>  The prospects for a successful outcome remain uncertain as the focus now moves to the House of Representatives.  I look forward to visiting Washington D.C. next week to meet with key figures on Capitol Hill and the Government will continue to use every possible opportunity to secure a positive outcome.  I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my appreciation for the active support we continue to receive from a number of Irish community organisations, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts and the Ancient Order of Hibernians.  In pressing to secure a solution for the undocumented, we continue to work closely with them.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Emigrant Support Programme, has provided funding to a number of organisations active in this area.  They will be crucial partners as the immigration debate moves forward and I look forward to meeting representatives of these groups during my visit to Washington DC next week.</p></reply>

It has been suggested recently that huge savings could be made by moving from the current system of marking rebated fuel to one based on making repayments to those users that currently use marked fuel. This seems to be based on the erroneous view that adding the prescribed markers to rebated fuel is exceptionally costly and is borne by the Exchequer. This is not the case; the cost of the markers is negligible and is borne by the industry. The cost to the exchequer of marked fuel is the tax foregone and an alternative system based on direct repayments to users would not produce any savings for the exchequer and might be more costly if the incidence of fraud were greater. This system of marking diesel has been an effective and efficient means of delivering a tax rebate on a product used by a very large number of users across a wide range of uses. Fuel laundering to remove the marker added to lower-taxed mineral oil for off-road use has been a persistent problem over the years. However, it remained a marginal activity because the sulphur content of marked fuel was higher than that for road fuel and therefore the sulphur content continued to distinguish laundered fuel from genuine road fuel. Environmental requirements in relation to the sulphur content of fuel changed from the beginning of 2011, which resulted in marked fuel with the same sulphur content as road fuel coming onto the market. With this change, fuel laundering became more viable and criminal gangs intensified their laundering and distribution activities dramatically from the first half of 2011.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to estimate accurately the loss to the Exchequer from particular activities in the shadow economy such as fuel laundering<b>.</b> It is clear, however, that illegal activity in the fuel market is significant, and that it poses a threat to the tax yield and to legitimate business. Revenue, therefore, has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action. This strategy included strengthening the licensing conditions for auto-fuel traders in 2011 and the introduction of a new licensing system for marked fuel traders in October 2012. In addition, since January 2013, all licensed fuel traders are required to make electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions each month. These supply chain control measures are designed to make it difficult for fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering and to get laundered product onto the market. Analysis of the monthly returns of fuel trading will enable Revenue to identify suspicious or anomalous fuel transactions and patterns of distribution. Analysis of the first few months of returns data is well advanced. Traders found to be involved in suspicious activity will be investigated and if they are unable to account properly for the source or disposal of product will face revocation of their licence, tax assessment and prosecution where appropriate. In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions. A number of proposals for a new marker submitted in response to an Invitation to Make Submissions are currently being evaluated. The outcome of this process is expected later this year. Revenue, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, continues to intensify enforcement action against fuel fraud and this work has yielded significant results to date. In the past two years 97 filling stations throughout the State were closed for breaches of licensing conditions. Since the beginning of 2010, over 2.8 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 5 oil laundries in 2013 to date. Revenue regularly reminds motorists and the public generally that, in addition to its impact on the exchequer and legitimate trade, they should be aware of the risks posed to their vehicles by using laundered fuel and the fact that sourcing fuel in this way is funding criminal activity. The legitimate retail trade can also contribute to closing down this illegitimate trade by providing information on the outlets that are selling laundered diesel. Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) and has established Regional sub-groups of the HEMG to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations. Retailers who suspect or have evidence that laundered diesel is being sold in their area should report this through their representative associations to the Revenue. Such reports are treated as confidential and are fully investigated by Revenue.</p></reply>

The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the Third EU Money-Laundering Directive.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 to transpose the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) and its Implementing Directive (2006/70/EC) into Irish Law.</p><p>  Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2010 sets out the obligations of &#8220;designated persons&#8221; in relation to customer identification.  One such obligation set out in the Act is the obligation to conduct customer due diligence, prior to the establishment of a business relationship. Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and that of any beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.</p><p>An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a &#8220;<i>designated person</i>&#8221; under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 as they fall within the definition of a &#8220;<i>financial institution</i>  &#8221;. In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of Prize Bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.</p><p>  The extent to which any particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements of the Act is determined by reference to the Act having regard to the underlying Directives.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.</p><p>  In light of the above, I am exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and my colleague the Minister for Justice whether or not exemptions available under the Directives may be applied to small value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.</p></reply>

It should be noted that consumer issues are covered by the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code which amongst other things sets out a series of general principles about how financial service firms (including all insurance companies) should interact with their customers. The Code however does not prohibit or restrict an insurance company from increasing its annual premium rates, as this is a commercial decision for the company in question and is generally determined by such issues as higher claims volumes, and the nature of the product.</p><p>  My Department has previously had a number of enquiries about this type of issue and it would appear that in most instances people have what are known as &#8220;Whole of Life&#8221; insurance policies. The Central Bank has advised that premiums for such policies are not fixed and can increase over the duration of the policy. &#8220;Whole of Life&#8221; policies which cover the policyholder for their entire lifetime while the policy is active must be distinguished from &#8220;Term Life&#8221; insurance policies which cover a fixed period of time such as 10 or 20 years and have a fixed premium unless index linked.  Finally, it should be noted that if a policyholder has a complaint about an insurance company not honouring a claim on a policy, they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman for adjudication <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>  .</p></reply>

It would be completely inappropriate for the Department of Finance to act outside of its legal powers and interfere with any investigation that could compromise potential future criminal or civil investigations by the bodies responsible under statute.    Any phone calls that are relevant around this period may feature as part of the forthcoming banking inquiry for which the legislation is currently before the House.

The investigation focussed on the unwinding of CFD positions in Anglo Irish Bank, the back-to-back loans with Irish Life and Permanent and loans to directors and connected parties.   In May, 2011, the Garda&iacute; informed the Bank, following consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions, that to proceed with the Bank&rsquo;s investigations at that time could prejudice any future criminal prosecutions. Accordingly, the Bank decided to defer its investigation but has kept this decision under review. Given the seriousness and sensitivity of criminal proceedings and the strength of the sanctions available to the Garda&iacute; and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Bank considers that this is the most appropriate approach to take where there is a reasonable possibility of multiple proceedings. Regular liaison with these agencies is continuing.</p><p>  In relation to Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS), an investigation into historical lending practices at INBS is at an advanced stage and, once concluded, decisions regarding any possible future enforcement proceedings will be made.</p><p>  In addition to the above two investigations, the Bank commenced a review in June, 2011, of the fitness and probity of all sitting directors of the six banks and building societies covered by the State guarantee. This review concluded in June, 2012. In respect of a small number of directors, the Bank investigated more thoroughly their individual roles and responsibilities during the period leading up to the present banking crisis. During the period of the review, many of the long-standing directors of the six institutions have resigned. </p><p>  In respect of any directors who continued in their roles into 2012 and beyond and who were in place prior to 2008, the Bank concluded that, based on the evidence available, it had no reason to suspect the fitness and probity of those individuals. In some cases, this decision was taken within the Bank and, in others, the Bank sought an external opinion on the material available. </p><p>  In respect of any directors of the institutions, including those whose tenure goes back to before 2008, the Bank will continue to carry out its role in respect of the supervision of the fitness and probity of those directors. Where any information comes to light to give the Bank reason to suspect that the Bank&rsquo;s standards may not be met by any individual director, then the Bank will commence to investigate that information in a thorough and comprehensive manner and take any action that may be warranted using the powers available.</p><p>  New applications to sit on the boards of any of these institutions which remain under the Bank&rsquo;s active supervision will require the applicants to establish, to the satisfaction of the Bank, that proposed directors meet the Bank&rsquo;s minimum standards of fitness and probity. </p><p>  In addition to the above, the Central Bank is carefully studying the various transcripts emerging in relation to Anglo Irish Bank. This is something that is viewed very seriously. The Central Bank will be liaising with the Garda&iacute; in this regard and is also examining whether or not any breaches of regulatory requirements may have occurred arising from the information contained in the transcripts.</p></reply>

Private consumption was down -1.6 per cent, partly due to low car sales. Investment fell -19.8 per cent as there were fewer purchases of aircraft than in the same quarter of the previous year. Government consumption continued to fall as public service employment continues to shrink in line with policy objectives.</p><p>  On the external side, exports fell by -4.1 per cent. This is primarily due to patent expiration in the pharma sector as goods exports are down -9.4 per cent. Weak trading partner demand is also impacting. Imports fell by -4.2 per cent.</p><p>  Notwithstanding these data, the labour market continues to show signs of stabilisation. Figures published this morning show that unemployment has fallen from a high of 15.1 per cent in February 2012 to 13.6 per cent in June 2013. In addition, the latest Exchequer returns published yesterday by my Department highlight the consistent improvement in Ireland's public finances with the gap between income expenditure continuing to narrow.</p><p>  The latest GDP figures are below expectations of both domestic and international forecasters. This makes the Government's primary macroeconomic policy objective of putting the economy back on a sustainable growth path so as to move to a point where sustained net employment creation is taking place, even more imperative. </p><p>In this regard, competitiveness has improved substantially in recent years, with inflation at or below the euro area since March 2008. Tangible progress is being made to ensure a banking system healthy enough to support productive investment by <i>inter alia</i>   the SME sector. In relation to the public finances, the policy objective remains the correction of the excessive general government deficit by 2015, as recommended by the ECOFIN Council in late-2010. All of the interim annual deficit ceilings set by the Council have been met, and the Government remains committed to bringing the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP within the stated time horizon.</p><p>Finally, I would like to emphasise that the Government remains committed to tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment. Reflecting this, the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2013</i> set out over 333 actions to be undertaken in the coming year to support job creation and complement measures already undertaken in the <i>Jobs Initiative </i>and the <i>Pathways to Work</i>. </p></reply>

Following consideration of the issues involved, it was decided that the school-focused functions of the NCTE should be integrated more closely with other support services for teachers and schools and that certain functions relating to curriculum development be transferred to the NCCA. Therefore the NCTE was formally merged with the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) as of 1st June 2012, while a senior post from the NCTE dealing with curricular matters was assigned to the NCCA.  A new senior management team consisting of a Director and four Deputy Directors was appointed to the PDST organisation as a whole.</p><p>  One of the Deputy Director posts has responsibility for the ICT support service functions carried out by the staff of the former NCTE. The new configuration ensures greater integration of ICT within teaching and learning both in terms of policy and practice.  In relation to increasing the number of students opting for ICT courses at third level, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which was published in January 2012, sets out a multi-level approach with an overarching aim of doubling the number of graduates from ICT disciplines to 2,000 by 2018. It contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, in the short, medium and long term, including through the roll out of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes. Almost 1,500 places have been provided for graduate jobseekers under two the rounds of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes that have issued to date. More than 400 people have already graduated from these programmes and a further 300 are due to graduate before the end of this year. In addition, more than 3,700 people have enrolled on ICT programmes under the first two rounds of the Springboard reskilling initiative and a further 2,000 ICT Springboard places have been made available under the third phase of Springboard which was launched in June 2013.</p><p>  The Plan has helped to raise awareness of employment opportunities in ICT. Technology courses accounted for 20.5% of all honours degree level first preference applications through the CAO this year. The increase in demand from students for technology courses, including a 50% increase in first preference applications for computing over the past 5 years is very positive in building the future supply of graduates.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>  The level of resources being devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained at &euro;1.3 billion this year. This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers.  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings accross a range of areas.  There has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support.</p><p>  The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012/13 school year was 10,487 posts. For the 2011/12 school year it was 10,320 posts. The demand for SNAs for the 2013/2014 school year currently stands at 10,490 leaving some 85 posts available for late demand. It is therefore estimated that there will be sufficient SNA posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such support in the coming school year.  SNA allocations are made to schools by the NCSE annually, taking into account the assessed care needs of  qualifying children.  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March 2013.</p><p>  Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE for the 2013/2014 school year are now available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of the SNA allocations for each school on a school by school and per county basis.  Where schools have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that these allocations were made, or where schools are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them for the coming school year, they should contact the NCSE regarding this matter.  In general a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Five core modules of training are currently being delivered. The 5 topics available to Board of Management members are The Board as a Corporate Entity, Procedures Governing the Appointment of Staff in Schools, Board Finances &amp;amp; the Role of Treasurer, Legal Issues and Child Protection Guidelines. Other training is provided as is requested by members of Boards from time to time.</p><p>  When the training was established in 2006, my Department allocated a sum of &euro;1,000,000 and since then has provided an additional &euro;764,146 towards the training.  For 2013 my Department has allocated an amount of &euro;250,000 to BoM training.  A National Steering Committee, comprising representatives from all of the Management Bodies for schools, primary and post-primary, meets twice a year with the TES. The Steering Committee members oversee the design and planning of training materials and report on the roll-out of training for the respective school sectors.  The response by BOM members to the training, as reported by the Management Bodies, has been very positive.  The funding for Board of Management Training is administered on behalf of my Department by the Drumcondra Education Centre.</p></reply>

It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school. The most recent statistics are for the 2011/12 school year. The national average class size is 24.4 pupils. However, with over 20,700 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p><p>  Classroom teachers are allocated under the staffing schedule based on the pupil enrolments for the previous 30th September. However, the staffing schedule also includes provision for schools that have significant increases in their enrolment in rapidly developing areas to be allocated classroom teachers based on their projected enrolments for September 2013. The criteria for this are set out in the staffing schedule which is available on the Department website. Given the constraints on teacher numbers my Department has no capacity to put any other ameliorating measures in place.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has protected frontline services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget and there will no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013/14 school year as a result of the budget. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.</p></reply>

The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Director of Adult Education, Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility. Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts.</p><p>Limited alleviation was introduced for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level. This alleviation is mainly focused on post-primary schools. The detailed information requested by the Deputy would take some time to compile by staff in my Department. I do not therefore propose to divert them from their work on the staffing allocations for the 2013/14 school year. Instead I am providing you with the summary information on the overall impact of the moratorium since it was first introduced in March 2009. At that time about 53% of teachers had posts of responsibility. This has since reduced to about 39%. The attached tables give some more detail on the overall position since the moratorium was introduced.</p><p><bu>Level of Reduction in Posts of Responsibility</bu></p><p><table><tr><th>Post type</th><th>Post Primary</th><th>Primary</th></tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal </td><td>-2,222</td><td>-751</td></tr><tr><td>Special Duties </td><td>-1,836 </td><td>-2,276</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>-4,058 </td><td>-3,027</td></tr></table></p><p><bu>Alleviation.</bu></p><p><table><tr><th>Post type</th><th>Post Primary</th><th>Primary</th></tr><tr><td>Director of Adult Education  </td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Programme Co-ordinator (AP post)  </td><td>90</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal  </td><td>307</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>427 </td><td>38</td></tr></table></p></reply>

To this end, a range of initiatives have been and continue to be undertaken by my Department.</p><p>  One such example is the introduction of electronic submission of primary schools' annual enrolment returns resulting in significant administrative efficiencies to this annual process for both schools and my Department. </p><p>  In recent years, my Department has also simplified the teacher allocation and redeployment processes with a view to giving earlier certainty to schools in relation to their teacher allocation and the arrangements for the filling of teaching posts.</p><p>  Other developments in recent years have included the introduction of an Online Claims System (OLCS) for teacher payroll and the payment of part-time teachers through the Department's payroll. The latter ended the previously burdensome system under which each school, funded by grant payments, was required to make its own arrangements to pay part-time teachers.</p><p>  Across all areas of my Department, we are continuously seeking to identify opportunities, ranging from small administrative changes to the more significant and major reforms, to streamline our processes, achieve better value for money and ultimately improve the education provided to our students. My officials will continue to work, in consultation with stakeholders as appropriate, on addressing this issue on an on-going basis.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</p><p>  The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, in order to ensure that as many children as possible can be educated with their peers within their own community.  My Department therefore provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.  Children with special educational needs may be enrolled in a mainstream school and attend all mainstream classes and receive additional teaching support through the learning support and/or resource teacher.  Or they may enrol in a mainstream school and attend a special class, or they may enrol in a special school.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date.  The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.  In addition, the National Council for Special Education's (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p></reply>

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.  There has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year.  This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support. </p><p>  The demand for SNAs for the 2013/2104 school year currently stands at over 10,490 leaving over 80 posts available for late demand.  Some additional posts are also likely to be freed up during the year due to children not enrolling to schools or diminishing care needs.  The NCSE will allocate the remaining SNAs to schools during the year, as required, based on the care needs of qualifying children.</p><p>  In relation to the July Provision scheme I wish to clarify that the allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle.  This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary.  Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision.  The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals.  In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.</p><p>  However in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, separate allocations can considered on a case by case basis.  Applications in this regard will require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home.</p></reply>

Given the constraints on teacher numbers my Department has no capacity to put any other ameliorating measures in place.</p><p>  At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions.</p><p>  The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeal procedures are set out in the circulars referred to above. The Appeal Boards operate independently of the Department and their decisions are final.</p><p>  The final staffing position for all schools at primary and post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.</p></reply>

The level of resources devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained at &euro;1.3 billion this year. This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers, provision for over 600 Special Classes attached to mainstream schools at reduced pupil teacher ratios, enhanced capitation for special schools and special classes and provision for assistive technology support. </p><p>  Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department - some &euro;1.3 billion - was spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs in 2011/12. The provision for the 2012/13 school year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that the overall level of funding for special education has been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position. There has been no reduction in the level of funding to support children with Special Educational needs since this Government came to office.  </p><p>  The level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs, enrolled in all schools, including schools in Co. Kildare, to ensure that children with special educational needs, including those with Autism and Aspergers Syndrome can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.  </p><p>  In relation to the number of school places available for children with special educational needs throughout the country and in County Kildare, the policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs to be enrolled to. In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools.</p><p>  I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.</p><p>  In the interim, I wish to ensure that children will not be disadvantaged while we move towards a new model which will ensure greater fairness and quality of education for children with special educational needs. That is why I have made the decision to maintain the existing allocation levels this year.</p></reply>

On the basis of the analysis I published earlier this year on the income from fees available to fee charging schools, I expect that a minority of the fee charging schools will wish to engage with the Department in planning for their future.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;42 million was allocated for this initiative. Some thirty projects have been completed with approximately 100 others on site.</p><p>  In June of this year, I announced a further initiative to replace prefab units with permanent accommodation. A total of &euro;15 million has been allocated in 2013/2014 for this purpose. Forty-six schools, with 115 prefab units, will be offered grants to provide the new facilities.  </p><p>  Replacing prefabs is part of this Government's &euro;475 million education infrastructure plan for 2014. The Plan will provide modern, high quality accommodation for pupils and teachers and construction related jobs for workers around the county.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Five Year Construction Plan, that I announced on 9 March 2012, outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the Plan. The primary aim at the core of the Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.  The replacement of temporary accommodation with permanent structures may form part of the accommodation brief for some projects being delivered under this Plan. </p><p>  In addition, due to additional funding made available for the schools' building programme as part of the Government's &quot;Investing in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot; package announced recently, school projects that were not contained in the 5 year programme but have completed extensive architectural planning are now being progressed to tender and construction.  Where appropriate, this too will address the replacement of temporary accommodation with permanent structures. </p><p>  Details of all works funded, including those for schools in Kildare, under the above initiatives including Prefab Replacement and Additional Accommodation Schemes, are available on my Department's website and this is updated on a regular basis.</p></reply>

As enterprise sectors develop and expand, demand for employees with core technical and specialist expertise across a range of disciplines continues to grow. Employers also equally value more generic skills such as creativity, critical thinking, communication and interpersonal skills, and problem solving abilities. The fostering of these attributes and the development of core foundational skills in numeracy and literacy is built through the experience of students at both primary and second level. The wide ranging programme of reform which is being rolled out across all levels of the education system seeks to further improve the quality of the teaching and learning experience for all students and to ensure the ongoing supply of high quality graduates for the workforce.</p><p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which is funded by my Department, also plays a key role in advising on future skills needs and any emerging gaps. Its research provides a valuable input to the development of course curricula and has also informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision to address emerging skills needs, including Springboard, Momentum and the ICT skills conversion programmes and Skillnets. The development of training on these programmes is led by representatives of industry ensuring that training provision meets the needs of the sector.</p></reply>

The following table from the report illustrates the non-presence rates of new entrants in their second year of study by sector, NFQ level and course duration. New entrants are classified as 'not present' if they do not appear in the statistical returns of that institution in the following academic year. The proportion of new entrants in 2007/08 who were not present one year later was 15% on average across all sectors and NFQ Levels. Prior educational attainment is a very significant factor.<br />  The HEA is currently in the process of working on an analysis of retention rates in the universities and institutes of technology. This has only recently become possible due to a full population of SRS (Student Record System) data becoming available for a period spanning five years. The HEA which is responsible for the collection of data on student progression does not have information for the current academic year, however it is currently collating data for the 2010/11 academic year and it is hoped that this data will be available in the autumn. Higher education institutions have a wide range of supports in place to improve retention of students in their institutions.  The HEA study and other research has also highlighted that undergraduate first years are most at risk of non-progression.  The new National Forum for the enhancement of Teaching and Learning that I established late last year is looking at the undergraduate student experience in first year and how that may be improved on a system wide basis.  Their work should improve quality outcomes for students at that difficult transition period.  <br />  The work of the Transition reform group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department should also contribute to improvements in students' quality outcomes.  A key commitment has been made by the higher education institutions to reduce the number of level 8 programmes offered through the CAO and broadening them.  This should help school leavers better navigate the entry routes into higher education system when making the important choice about what programme to undertake.  They will also be exposed to a broader first year experience.  This change when implemented should help to reduce the number of school leavers making the wrong choice about what course of study to undertake and help to reduce non-progression and completion.</p><p>Non-Presence Rates for New Entrants by Sector and NFQ Level (2008/09).</p><p><table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Level</th><th>Most Common Points Attained</th><th>% Not Present</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Level 6</td><td>250-300</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Level 7</td><td>250-300</td><td>26%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Level 8</td><td>300-350</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>L8 3 yr duration</td><td>300-350</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>L8 4 yr duration</td><td>300-350</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>L8 4+ yr duration</td><td>450-500</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Institutes of Technology</td><td>All New Entrants</td><td>300-350</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Level 8</td><td>400-450</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>L8 3 yr duration</td><td>350-400</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>L8 4 yr duration</td><td>450-500</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Universities</td><td>L8 4+ yr duration</td><td>550-600</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Level 8</td><td>450-500</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>L8 3 yr duration</td><td>450-500</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Other Colleges</td><td>L8 4 yr duration</td><td>400-450</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>All Institutions</td><td>Level 8</td><td>350-400</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>All Institutions</td><td>All New Entrants</td><td>350-400</td><td>15%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities. </p><p>  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. </p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.</p><p>  In the course of my recent meeting with Down Syndrome Ireland a number of issues were raised which I consider merit further examination. Accordingly I have asked my officials to consider these issues further and to provide a full response to Down Syndrome Ireland on the issues raised as soon as possible. </p></reply>

If the Board of Management of a school decides to engage a person (whether on a voluntary or paid basis) to assist or supplement the classroom teacher, the Board must ensure that appropriate selection procedures have been followed and that the person is suitably qualified to undertake the duties concerned.  In this regard, good practice involves the checking of recent employment records, qualifications, experience and names of referees.  In relation to Garda vetting, all schools are also required to comply with the vetting arrangements, including those relating to volunteers, as set out in my Department's Circular 0063/2010.</p><p>  It should be noted that the teaching staff and principal remain responsible for the provision of the curriculum and must exercise effective control over the planning and content and delivery of lessons and the assessment of pupil progress.   The class teacher continues to be responsible for the supervision of pupils in situations where an external tutor or other individual is working with the class and the class teacher therefore must remain with the pupils during such periods. </p></reply>

The Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;3.66bn in 2013.</p><p>As of end May 2013 there were 87,943 casual or part-time workers on the schemes, of whom 33,354 were receipt of jobseeker benefit and 54,589 were in receipt of jobseeker allowance. The family income supplement or FIS payment is designed to provide income for employees on low earnings with families.  The FIS payment preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he/she was unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments. The Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure on FIS of nearly &euro;230 million in 2013.  There are currently just under 40,600 families benefiting from the FIS scheme.</p><p>To qualify for payment of FIS a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.</p><p>Administrative data in relation to the number of hours worked by FIS recipients is not available.  However, the table below lists the twenty private sector employers with the largest number of employees who are in receipt of FIS as at end June 2013.</p><p>It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, with a consequent increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week. This is an important policy issue for my Department but any changes to the current criteria could have significant cost implications. For that reason my Department will consider this issue very carefully. In tandem the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has already reported to me on a number of important policy areas, is now looking at the whole area of atypical work and I look forward to their recommendations on this issue.</p><p>The following tables set out the most recent analysis by my Department of private sector employers who employ persons also in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and allowance, or family income supplement.

A recent independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns progress to paid employment after completing their internship.  These progression outcomes into employment are among the best in Europe for similar schemes.  The eligibility to access the Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy to provide a pathway to paid employment for people who are unemployed.</p><p>  At present, an individual may avail of up to two placements on the Scheme, the total cumulative time not exceeding 9 months (39 weeks). The duration of any individual internship is determined, within these guidelines by the host organisations.   The maximum cumulative period that an intern may undertake on one or more internships is currently being reviewed in line with other findings and recommendations contained in the Indecon evaluation report.  Any amendments to the Scheme will be communicated clearly on the JobBridge website a person who has completed nine months on JobBridge may apply to take-up a Work Placement Programme with another organisation.</p></reply>

However, when determining whether an individual is employed or self-employed, consideration is given to the Code of Practice for Determining the Employment or Self-employment Status of Individuals.  As indicated in my reply to your previous question on this matter (No. 30220-13) which was answered on the 25th June 2013 the class of PRSI payable by an individual is effectively determined by the terms and conditions of the employment in which they are engaged.

The CSP grant reflects the nature of the contract with the programme rather than any reduction in the level of funds available to the Programme.  The charge introduced by Vantastic for this particular service is a matter for the Board of the company and does relate to the services that are part funded by the Department of Social Protection.  A key feature of the CSP is the requirement of the contract holder to generate a substantial level of its resources from the fees charged or other traded income from service provision.

They are either single or may have a spouse or partner who is working. In addition, just over half (53%) of the people on the Live Register receive less than the maximum personal weekly rate.  This means that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the Register each year.  The replacement rate for given income levels is a tool used to measure the degree to which  of out-of-work benefits when unemployed replace take home income from work.  The replacement rates my Department calculate highlight the strong financial incentive that the majority of jobseekers have to enter employment.  While there is no predetermined level of replacement rate which would influence every individual&rsquo;s decision to work, higher replacement rates may indicate lower incentives to take up employment.  In this regard a replacement rate in excess of 70% may be considered to be excessive.</p><p>Generally, my Department calculates replacement rates for the following family types:</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- Single claimants</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- Married or co-habiting couples:</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- Couple with no Children (1 earner);</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- Couple with 1 Child(1 earner +1 Child Dependent);</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- Couple with 2 Children (1 earner +2 Child Dependent);</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- Couple with 4 Children (1 earner +4 Child Dependent).</div></p><p>The following table sets out replacement rates values, which compare social welfare income, assuming that fuel allowance is payable, with net income at National Minimum Wage (NMW), two thirds of the Average Weekly Earnings (67% AWE) and Average Weekly Earnings (AWE).</p><p><b>Replacement Rates 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>-</b></th><th><div><b>NMW</b></div></th><th><div><b>67% AWE</b></div></th><th><div><b>AWE</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Single</div></td><td><div>61%</div></td><td><div>50%</div></td><td><div>37%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Couple 1 earner</div></td><td><div>68%</div></td><td><div>64%</div></td><td><div>55%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Couple 1 earner +1 Child Dependent</div></td><td><div>72%</div></td><td><div>68%</div></td><td><div>61%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Couple 1 earner +2 Child Dependent</div></td><td><div>75%</div></td><td><div>71%</div></td><td><div>66%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Couple 1 earner +4 Child Dependent</div></td><td><div>75%</div></td><td><div>72%</div></td><td><div>66%</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In general, replacement rate analysis demonstrates that for the overwhelming majority of social welfare recipients, replacement rates are relatively low and they have a strong financial incentive to take up employment. Replacement rates for certain jobseekers can be higher than those listed in the above table if the jobseeker is in receipt of rent supplement or mortgage interest supplement. However, the vast majority of jobseekers do not receive these additional supports.</p></reply>

The regulations will enable the Communications Regulator, ComReg, to use its investigative and enforcement powers to oblige mobile telephone service providers to implement retail price reductions required by the EU Roaming Regulation.  The regulation of roaming charges is an EU competency following the introduction of an EU Regulation in 2007, which introduced harmonised maximum charges for roaming voice services across the European Union.</p><p>From 1 July 2013, the new EU Roaming Regulation lowered the price caps for data downloads by 36%, making it much cheaper to use maps, watch videos, check emails and update social networks while travelling across borders.  Data roaming is now up to 91% cheaper in 2013 compared to 2007.  The Regulation also introduced per megabyte price limits of &euro;0.70 per megabyte from July 2012, which reduced to &euro;0.45 on July 1st. It will reduce further to &euro;0.20 in July 2014.</p><p>The reduction in maximum retail prices (excluding VAT) required by the current EU Regulation over three years is outlined as follows.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Service</b></th><th><b>1 July 2012</b><br /><b>&euro;</b></th><th><b>1 July 2013</b><br /><b>&euro;</b></th><th><b>1 July 2014</b><br /><b>&euro;</b></th></tr><tr><td>Outgoing call <br />- per  minute</td><td>0.29</td><td>0.24</td><td>0.19</td></tr><tr><td>Incoming call<br />- per minute</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.05</td></tr><tr><td>Call to voicemail</td><td>free</td><td>free</td><td>free</td></tr><tr><td>Outgoing SMS/text</td><td>0.09</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.06</td></tr><tr><td>Incoming text</td><td>free</td><td>free</td><td>free</td></tr><tr><td>Data<br />-per megtabyte</td><td>0.70</td><td>0.45</td><td>0.20</td></tr></table></p><p>It is a matter for the regulatory authority in each Member State to ensure that service providers do not exceed the maximum permitted retail roaming charges.

A key objective is to rationalise the cost of the current service delivery and ensure more efficient operation of water services by moving from 34 water services authorities to a single body; following enactment of comprehensive legislation later this year, Irish Water will, therefore, become the water services authority from 1 January 2014, responsible for the supply of public water and waste water services. Functions, such as the bulk provision of water to private group water schemes from public water supplies, will become the responsibility of Irish Water from that date. Irish Water will be working through service level agreements with local authorities to deliver on a range of their functions.  Work being progressed at present is examining the necessary processes for the transfer of assets and financial liabilities associated with these assets taking into account, inter alia,  the impacts on local government finances. </p></reply>

The project referred to received RDP funding, through Clare Local Development Company, of almost &euro;150,000 under the Conservation and Upgrading of the Rural Heritage measure of the RDP during 2012 and the promoter now wishes to avail of further funding under the Programme but is prohibited due to State Aid/ &ldquo;de minimis&rdquo; rules. </p><p>  I recently met briefly with the project promoters and outlined to them that in accordance with the State Aid rules/&lsquo;de minimis&rsquo; (Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1998/2006) the overall limit of &lsquo;de minimis&rsquo; aid cannot exceed &euro;200,000 over any three year period under the Conservation and Upgrading of the Rural Heritage measure of the RDP. The three year period is from the date of award of funding, and the &lsquo;de minimis&rsquo; limit in this case will apply until the end of 2014. The rule applies to both the project and the promoter. </p><p>  It is possible to seek a derogation in relation to the Conservation and Upgrading of the Rural Heritage measure. However, the Programme amendment process, as stipulated in the regulatory framework, is quite complex and can take some time to complete with no guarantee that the amendment submitted would be approved by the European Commission. As funding commitments under the current Programme are closing at the end of the 2013 there would not be enough time remaining to facilitate the programme change process for the current programming period. My Department will consider this issue when developing the framework for the Rural Development Programme for the 2014-2020 programming period. </p></reply>

The Conference, which will continue until 5 July, is the first time that all Member States of the IAEA have had the opportunity to attend, at ministerial level ,   a Conference on Nuclear Security and it is therefore a welcome step forward in multilateral engagement. </p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd made a statement to the Conference during the afternoon session of the opening day. In his statement, he confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s policy position not to use nuclear energy for the generation of electricity but highlighted the high value Ireland puts on the peaceful use of nuclear technology. He noted that Ireland was conscious of the risks which may be associated with nuclear power and technologies, in particular the risk of malicious acts and of nuclear terrorism. </p><p>Minister of State O&rsquo;Dowd stressed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to effective multilateralism as the best way of achieving and upholding the rule of law, ensuring international peace and security, and advancing international cooperation. The Minister of State noted that Ireland has been associated , from the outset, with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as the multilateral basis for achieving complete nuclear disarmament, preventing nuclear proliferation, and facilitating the peaceful uses of nuclear energy subject to strict international controls and standards.   </p><p>  He also referred to Ireland&rsquo;s positive contribution to the dialogue aimed at improving Government to Government communications on nuclear shipments, which has been underway at the IAEA since late 2012. </p><p>Finally, he concluded that it is appropriate for the international community to use the opportunity of the Conference to take stock in assessing lessons learned in the area of nuclear security; to identify those areas for further action; and to act collectively for the common good. The on-going contribution which the IAEA is making in this area is to be welcomed and Ireland offers its full support in drafting and implementing the Nuclear Security Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2017.   </p><p>In terms of his international engagements during his time in Vienna, Minister of State O&rsquo;Dowd and my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs had a pre-arranged meeting with the IAEA Director General Mr Yukiya Amano on 1 July .  The Minister of State also met informally with representatives from Italy and Portugal. A meeting also took place with the delegation from Lithuania, which assumed the Presidency of the Council of the EU from 1 July. </p></reply>

I was aware in general terms of course that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had obtained an enormous range of documents and recordings in the course of these investigations but the detail of this material would have been a matter for the investigating and prosecuting authorities alone.  In the circumstances, as I have indicated previously, I had, quite properly, no knowledge of the tapes in question until they were disclosed publicly.</p><p>  Equally, I do not have a function in relation to establishing the origin of the disclosure of the tapes referred to and, accordingly, I cannot comment on this, other than to say that I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the issue of a criminal investigation into the disclosure of the tapes has not arisen. </p><p>  As I have stated previously in this House I share the widespread concern that the criminal investigations into the former Anglo-Irish Bank be resolved as soon as possible.  However, what is most important now is that nothing be said which would in any way risk the possibility of prejudicing any criminal proceedings.</p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that a number of Garda investigation files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions as have several files from the parallel investigation taking place under the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  The investigations comprise several strands which, as has previously been indicated, include the provision of funds by Anglo to various parties for the purpose of its shares, the so-called 'back to back' short term deposits, issues concerning loans to directors and matters relating to financial statements and disclosures.  Three persons are currently charged with offences under the Companies Acts and a number of files remain with the DPP awaiting her independent directions.  There continues to be close contact between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the  DPP in relation to all matters arising from these cases.  In the circumstances it will be appreciated that it would not be appropriate to make any further comment on the detail of these matters.</p></reply>

However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board on his behalf.</p><p>I am advised that demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&quot;the Board&quot;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy.  While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.  Demand in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012.  The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board's grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011).</p><p>Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery.  The Public Appointments Service has recently concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board from which appointments, both temporary and permanent, are being made at the moment.</p><p>In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services.  Those steps include the following:</p><p>- The Board has been piloting a 'triage' approach in most of its law centres to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage.  The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times.  The aim of the 'triage' approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes).  If the applicant requires further services they remain on the 'waiting list'.  There is or has been a 'backlog' of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month.  A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were overwhelmingly satisfied with this particular service initiative.  This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.</p><p>- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres.  This is a 'start to end' system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services;</p><p>- In November 2011 the Board took responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service.  A key reason for transferring this responsibility to the Board was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law).  Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a 'litigation first' approach that may on occasion be too common.  Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also.  Steps are now being taken to replicate this initiative in a number of other locations including Cork and Naas;</p><p>- With the drop in demand for asylum services the Board has taken steps to integrate its Refugee Legal Service into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased;</p><p>- The Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court;</p><p>- The Board has continued to engage with other key players in the justice / legal area with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.</p><p>I am currently considering a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid.  These provisions may have some impact, albeit relatively marginal, on the demand for legal services and the resources available to the Board.</p><p>I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to and I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible.  I have noted some of the steps that it has taken and I know that it is constantly keeping the delivery of its services under review with a view to getting services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.</p><p>It is difficult to give an 'average' waiting time as waiting times fluctuate at the individual law centres depending on the levels of demand, the levels of resources available and &lsquo;environmental&rsquo; factors such as the frequency of court sittings.</p><p>The waiting times at law centres for non prioritised matters are as per the schedule below.  This schedule sets out the waiting times for centres not operating the triage approach (second column) and the waiting times for centres operating the triage approach (third and fourth column).  The fourth column indicates the additional time that a person who has had a triage appointment is likely to have to wait for a second consultation.</p><p><bu>Details re waiting times and numbers waiting on the 1</bu><bu>st</bu><bu>June 2013 (in months)</bu></p><p></p><p><table><tr><th>Law Centre</th><th>General <br />Law Centre not operating triage</th><th>Waiting time for a triage appointment </th><th>Further waiting time where triage appointment previously given</th></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brunswick St</td><td></td><td>9</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>12</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td>14</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gardiner St</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Popes Quay</td><td>9</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>South Mall</td><td>12</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td></td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>4</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td>13</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway- Francis St</td><td></td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Galway - Seville H</td><td></td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td></td><td>2</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td></td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>10</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td></td><td>6</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td></td><td>6</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>4</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td>6</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>7</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>9</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>12</td></tr></table></p><p></p></reply>

Its role is to provide a vetting service to registered organisations who employ or engage persons to work with children or vulnerable adults. The disclosure is made to the organisation to enable it to decide on the suitability of the person and the function of deciding whether an individual is suitable to work in a registered organisation rests within each registered organisation and not the GCVU.</p><p>  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.

For example, all male persons committed to prison on remand, pending trial or under sentence of imprisonment or otherwise from any court in the county of Cork, the county borough of Cork, the county of Kerry, the county of Waterford or the county borough of Waterford are committed to Cork Prison unless otherwise stated.  Other areas are associated to other prisons on a similar basis.</p><p>  A guiding principle in the placement of prisoners is that they are detained in an institution as near to their homes as possible to facilitate visits from relatives and friends.  Accommodation near their home, however, may not always be possible.    For example, female prisoners can only be accommodated in the Dochas Centre on the Mountjoy Campus in Dublin or in Limerick Prison.  Pressures of space and security considerations are also taken into account, as is the need to keep certain prisoners apart from the general population for their own safety.</p><p>  When a prisoner is committed to prison the management of the prisoner's sentence and any transfers take place on foot of administrative decisions made on my behalf.  Every effort is made to balance the needs of the prisoner and the aim of providing an effective rehabilitative environment for as many prisoners as possible.  In order to maximise the effectiveness of prison programmes, prisoners may move between different prisons at various points in their sentence.</p><p>  Other common reasons for prisoner movements include court appearances, disruptive behaviour, conflict with other prisoners, to participate in a particular training or educational course, to assist in reintegration or to alleviate overcrowding.

The fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry.  A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production.  Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353 million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6 million to machinery contractors.  There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations to allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for Ireland.</p><p>  I know you will be aware that in 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a new sugar/bioethanol facility in the country.  I understand from figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, that the overall capital cost costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed.</p><p>  I have previously indicated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that at the recent Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I chaired under Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package to abolish sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1st October 2017, the quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States wishing to re-establish a sugar industry.  This agreement has been welcomed by those who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.</p></reply>

However, in general terms, the situation as described most commonly occurs where an applicant has made an over-claim on his or her contract and my Department discovers that over-claim.</p><p>  The forestry schemes administered by my Department and other schemes, such as the Single Farm Payment scheme, use computerised geo-spatial and payments systems. These systems use ortho-photography, which is geometrically corrected aerial photography overlaid onto maps. The systems capture an image of an applicant's claim map and calculate an accurate measurement of the area being claimed. The process of electronically capturing the claim map is called digitisation. This technology has been used internationally for many years. Tolerances are applied when capturing and measuring claims in order to avoid penalising applicants due to minor inaccuracies in their claims. To ensure accuracy and consistency, digitising is performed by the contracted company using well established standards and procedures. My Department has no concerns over the accuracy of ortho-photography and geo-spatial systems for measuring areas. Digitising accuracy depends on the applicant's claim map &ndash; if the applicant submits a claim map which does not accurately define the area planted then the digitised image will obviously reflect that.</p><p>  My Department, including Forestry Division, uses constantly updated ortho-photography to detect potential over-claims and overpayments. A simple example would be where a forestry plantation is initially established, the trees planted are not visible when viewed in contemporaneous photographs. However, when viewed on later photography, maturing trees in the plantation will be visible but the more recent photographs may show gaps where trees have failed, were removed, or were never planted. The updated photography therefore provides an effective audit tool to ensure that claims made under my Department&rsquo;s schemes are accurate.</p><p>Over-claims and overpayments on forestry contracts (and other schemes) are detected in this manner or through random or risk analysis driven inspections; through Single Farm Payment queries by applicants or their neighbours; through forestry queries by the applicant himself; by formal audit of files, etc. Any over-claim and overpayment, regardless of how it was detected, will be similar to the case described, in that the contract will be paid on an area determined from the applicant&rsquo;s claim from the 1st grant onwards and then, if an over-claim is discovered, the payable area will be adjusted downwards and any overpayment will be recouped.</p><p>  It is impossible for the Forest Service to predict how many over-claims are made on contracts, as it must first detect each individual over-claim in order to be aware it. In all cases of overpayments, my Department is obliged to recoup any public money that has been overpaid.</p></reply>

The SCP is a key programme under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Action Plan.</p><p>  In 2013 an allocation of &euro;26.246m has been provided for the programme. This supports 124 projects and related initiatives which operate in 470 primary schools and 224 post-primary schools across the country to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people. The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, published in December 2011, requires the SCP to achieve cumulative savings of &euro;5.5m over the period 2012 to 2014, of which &euro;1.8m in savings is to be found in 2013.</p><p>  My Department has recently written to the Chairperson of each SCP in relation to the next cycle of the programme. Each Local Management Committee, which is responsible for the delivery of services to local students, is currently developing its 2013/2014 proposals for targeted interventions and supports. The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), which operates under the remit of my Department, is providing assistance to each Local Management Committee in this process. The administrative and financial arrangements for the coming year are being finalised and will be confirmed to individual projects during the coming months.</p><p>  The savings necessary in 2014 will be further considered in the context of the operational review which is to be conducted during the coming academic year. A core objective of the review will be to ensure that available funds are appropriately targeted to support those pupils most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Work is already underway to gather comprehensive information relating to existing organisational arrangements across all local project structures. It is also proposed to procure external expertise to further support the review process. This review will assist to identify the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing in the coming years.</p><p>  I remain committed to supporting the educational attainment of children and young people at risk of early school leaving through a variety of formal and informal support services.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining this universal programme and some 68,000 children are availing of it at this time.   The programme is expected to cost in the region of &euro;175 million this year.</p><p>  I am aware of the need to further develop the early childhood care and education sector.  However, any development that involves further pre-school provision would require considerable additional funding. I am also very conscious that work is continuing on improvement of quality within the pre-school year. All of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the provision is key to good outcomes for children.  In particular, I would like to see further progress in workforce development within the sector given the demands which expansion would place on the current pool of trained staff.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education are being considered in the context of the National Early Years Strategy.</p></reply>

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.</p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.   The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.</p><p>  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A further &euro;20 per week will be paid by the parent to the provider in both instances.</p><p>  The new After-school Childcare programme will further augment my Department's programme of childcare supports for low income families. These include the Community Childcare Subvention and the Childcare Education and Training Support  programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, including qualifying parents who are on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses.  In 2013, my Department expects to spend in the region of &euro;70 million on these programmes, supporting over 30,000 childcare places.</p></reply>

Thereafter, it must be notified to the EU Commission under the EU Transparency Directive prior to its publication and initiation of the Bill in the Oireachtas.

This was transposed by the European Union (Quality and Safety of Human Organs Intended for Transplantation) Regulations, S.I. No. 325 of 2012.    </p><p>  The Regulations apply to donation, procurement, testing, characterisation, transport and transplantation of organs.  They set out a clear legal framework for the application of quality and safety standards for human organs intended for transplantation.  The Regulations, however, do not specify who should or should not be donors, but state that selection assessments carried out pursuant to the regulations may provide for the exclusion of persons whose donation could present unacceptable health risks. </p><p>  In order for transplantation to proceed safely all potential donors are risk assessed in order to prevent inadvertent transmission of infection. All potential donors, or in the case of deceased donors their next of kin, must answer a range of questions prior to the organ donation process proceeding.  They include questions in relation to certain  risk behaviours. The decision on whether someone who is gay may become a donor is not based on sexual orientation, but because it is known that there is an increased level of HIV infection rates in MSM in Ireland. Testing for HIV remains very sensitive and effective, but there remains a period between infection and detection which could permit the transmission of the virus to a recipient.   For this reason sexually active gay men are currently excluded from becoming organ donors.   </p></reply>

The research process comprised of two stages. The first stage was an independent draft academic research report, which was based on an analysis of published medical reports and research. The draft report contained information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compared rates with other countries. The second stage in the research process was consultation on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who had undergone symphysiotomy.  This second stage has just completed by the researcher, and following peer review, has been submitted to me for consideration.

Approval for a HSE direct-build PCC was approved in 2012 in the context of the HSE's multi-annual Capital Plan.   Following the review of a number of sites in the area, the HSE identified a Dublin City Council owned property on Mellowes Road, Finglas as the preferred site for the construction of the proposed new Finglas PCC.  Subject to planning permission, the commercial terms for the sale were agreed with the officials of Dublin City Council and approved by the HSE.  This site was selected because</p><p>- it is centrally located in the catchment area which it is intended to serve;</p><p>- it has very good accessibility and is well served by bus routes;</p><p>- it is a generous green-field site, has future expansion capacity and there would be no impact on current services during the construction period; </p><p>- it would complement the HSE Day Care Centre on Kildonan Road;</p><p>- it facilitates the establishment of GP services in this area;   local GPs have expressed significant interest in discussion with the HSE, in being a part of this development in this specific location.</p><p>  The HSE now advises that the North West Committee which is a local area committee of Dublin City Council has rejected the proposed sale of the Mellowes Road site to the HSE for use as a health care facility.    A final decision is awaited from Dublin City Council.    The HSE remains committed to the development of this primary care centre and has appointed a design team who have commenced a preliminary design.  The design is now on-hold pending completion of the purchase.  It was intended to submit the planning application once the site acquisition had been finalised.  </p><p>  An important feature of the HSE's construction programme is that it recognises the construction dynamic - that construction projects can develop at different paces - and as a consequence it is multi-annual.   Ring-fencing this project's estimated construction costs would cut across the multi-annual concept and be counter-productive, as funds ring-fenced but not spent in a given year must be surrendered to the Exchequer at year end.    This project's progress and its estimated costs (as is the case for all other projects) are reviewed and revised as appropriate at each stage of development.  </p></reply>

I expect to complete this consideration shortly.  The focus of this strategy will be on the development of a culture of safety amongst seafarers and the crucial role of regulation and enforcement.</p><p>  All fishing vessels, regardless of size, are required to carry a satellite emergency position-indicating radio beacon, EPIRB, appropriate to their size and the sea area in which they operate.  The Marine Casualty Investigation Board has recommended that all fishing vessels carry automatically activated float free EPIRBs and the issue of personal locator beacons, PLBs, has been recommended for examination.</p><p>  My Department has been working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Iascaigh Mhara on the legislative and financial supports for a series of maritime safety measures focused on the fishing community, including the mandatory use of automatically activated float free EPIRBs and PLBs.  Later this month I, along with my colleague Minister Coveney, will launch a joint initiative targeting increased safety in the fishing industry, concentrating on an integrated package of measures including mandatory training and grant aid for mandatory safety equipment. PLBs, used in conjunction with a Lifejacket, should enhance search and rescue efforts, including Man Over Board incidents.  These measures are designed to enhance safety for fishermen and in parallel to promote a culture of safety within the industry.</p></reply>

The RSA developed these measures following extensive study and public consultation.  There is a great deal of international research and evidence to show that novice drivers are, as a group, at risk due to lack of experience, sometimes compounded by a mistaken sense that once qualified they may have little more to learn.  The idea of placing restrictions on novice drivers is therefore well grounded in evidence.</p><p>  The choice of a two-year period for the novice category is also based on international experience.  It coincides with the preferred novice period in a number of other jurisdictions.  In some other cases the novice period is as much as five years.  One point of the novice period is to underline and impress on recently qualified drivers that the learning process does not end with the passing of the test, and that there are important improvements which develop only with experience.  This takes time, and I am satisfied that a two-year period is an appropriate span for the category.</p><p>  I plan to introduce the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill, which provides for the two-year period for novice drivers, in the Oireachtas as soon as possible and there will be an opportunity to discuss the matter then.</p></reply>
