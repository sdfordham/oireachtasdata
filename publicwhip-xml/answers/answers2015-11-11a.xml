It is expected that this section will open in 2017 and a complete route from Maynooth to Athlone will provide a superb amenity for everyone to enjoy.</p></reply>

The development of the Wild Atlantic Way is an operational matter for the Board and management of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I have asked the agency to reply directly to the Deputy in this regard and I would ask you to contact my private office if you do not hear from F&aacute;ilte Ireland within ten working days.</p>  <p>  However, I am informed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland that in December 2014 funding of &euro;990,000 was allocated by the agency towards the development of this project.  Planning permission has been granted and works commenced in July 2015.  The works programme, which is being implemented by Galway County Council, is now well advanced and full completion is expected in advance of the 2016 tourist season. </p>  <p>  In addition to a new car park and related infrastructure, the project involves presenting for visitors the remarkable stories of the Marconi wireless station and the Alcock and Brown first transatlantic flight as part of an interpreted looped walk on the actual site where the events happened.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the completion of this project in 2016 which will add substantially to the tourism assets of Galway and the Wild Atlantic Way.</p></reply>

Work on the new draft Statutory Orders and new Environmental Statement is complete and, when published, will be subject to public consultation which may lead to a further Public Inquiry.</p>  <p>  As set out in "Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021", the Government remains supportive of the project.  The timeframe for the project is dependent on planning issues which are currently being addressed by the Northern authorities.  Once the planning, timing and costs related to the project are settled, consideration will be given to the funding implications.</p>  <p>  The North South Ministerial Council Transport meeting scheduled for November was deferred and will be re-arranged for a suitable future date.</p></reply>

The draft strategy provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA for the next two decades, including along two transport corridors serving North Kildare.  The draft strategy is currently open for public consultation.</p>  <p>  The long term strategy includes proposals for the expansion of Dart services to Celbridge/Hazelhatch and other measures along the Kildare corridors.  Delivery of projects prioritised in the final GDA Strategy will be dependent on the availability of funding under the next capital plan post-2022, including from non-Exchequer sources.  </p>  <p>  As regards short term priority measures for commuters in North Kildare, the Phoenix Park Tunnel project which will cost approx.  &euro;13 million will be completed in late 2016.  The project will see commuters on the Kildare to Dublin Heuston line have the option of direct trains to Connolly, Tara St, Pearse and Grand Canal Dock Stations from late 2016.  The new rail services will provide an attractive alternative for private motorists who currently commute into the city from Kildare along the busy N7 and N4 road corridors. </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;300,000 is also being provided this year for the construction of a public transport hub on Naas Main Street - Dublin Road corridor, to encompass redesigned bus stopping areas, new bus shelter, real time passenger information signs, seating, planting, cycle stands, transport/tourism information panels, paving and street furniture improvements.</p>  <p>  These short term measures will complement the major new roads projects for  North Kildare, as recently announced under the new Capital Plan, namely  Naas-Newbridge bypass widening on the M7 and the construction of the Sallins bypass.</p></reply>

This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure together with targeted investments to enhance the existing network through improving connections to seaports, to poorly served regions, to large-scale employment sites, and addressing critical safety issues.</p><p>Based on the findings in that report, maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget under the new Capital Plan - over &euro;4 billion - is earmarked for such essential work. Similarly, a large portion of the capital funding for Public Transport - &euro;2.6 billion - will be required for investment in essential 'steady state' maintenance and asset renewal across the national public transport network. </p><p>The capital budget for Roads also includes a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.  Where new road investments are proposed they are directed at addressing specific issues on the road network, for example, alleviating bottlenecks such as the Dunkettle roundabout and the Naas Bypass.</p><p>On Public Transport, a further &euro;1 billion on top of the 'steady state' requirement of &euro;2.6 billion, will be invested under the new Capital Plan to address growing congestion resulting from economic recovery and population growth.</p></reply>

My Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to foreign policy issues for all applications for permits issued under Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973.  As outlined in my response to the Deputy's question on 3 November last, no applications for permits have been received under the 1973 Order to date in 2015 for flights landing at Shannon or flying through Irish airspace en route to Saudi Arabia from the US.</p></reply>

Under this mechanism a person who is served with a summons for a fixed charge offence will have a final opportunity to pay a fixed charge, of an amount 100% greater than the original penalty, not later than seven days before the Court date on which the charge is to heard.  If a person takes up this option, proceedings are discontinued and the person need not attend.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the "third payment option" is a complex project involving An Garda Siochana, the Courts Service, the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, my Department, and the Attorney General's Office.  The project involves the merging of two totally different systems &ndash; the Fixed Charge Notice System operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the summonses issuing system operated by the Courts, in essence creating a hybrid system.  It entails tens of thousands of cases being processed through the system each year.  The project needs to be very carefully specified to deliver, inter alia, an automated system dealing with the receipt of monies, and the cancellation of the Court appearance or not, depending on whether the money is paid or not.  The project is currently at the detailed design stage and the implementation date is expected to be mid to end of 2016, as I have previously stated.</p></reply>

Having protected the level of PSO subvention last year, I am very happy that increased PSO funding of &euro;28 million was announced in the recent Budget, bringing the total PSO and Rural Transport funding in 2016 to &euro;248 million.  It will be the responsibility of the National Transport Authority (NTA) to gauge how best to allocate additional funding in response to priorities such as the new Phoenix Park tunnel services and DART service improvements and taking account of the role of the PSO operators under their contracts with the NTA.</p>  <p>  As regards the attractiveness of public transport, the NTA is fully committed to continually improving the quality and attractiveness of public transport services and is also engaged in the development and deployment of technologies to make it easier to use public transport.  The NTA has delivered a number of significant cross-operator initiatives such as real time information at bus stops, on Apps and online, the National Journey Planner, the Leap Card, investment in the bus fleet and on-board Wi-Fi, improved public transport maps and the reconfiguration of regional city bus services that to date includes Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. Accessibility has also been greatly improved through the addition of on-board displays and announcements of the next bus stop.</p>  <p>  In addition, with the launch of the Government's Capital Plan last September, over the next 7 years, I am planning an annual investment in land transport rising from just over &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.9 billion by 2022.  Under the Plan the public transport programme will reach &euro;3.6bn to include new and replacement buses, completion of the Luas Cross City project and the reopening of the Phoenix Park tunnel.</p></reply>

As well as year to year trends, it is also important to look at trends over the medium term. The average rate of child poverty in the period since the economic crisis commenced (2009-201) was 9.7 per cent, as compared with an average rate of 8.7 per cent in the years preceding the crisis (2005-2008).</p><p>The Government adopted a child poverty target in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020</i>. This aims to lift 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, equivalent to a reduction of two-thirds on the 2011 rate. This is a medium term target and is not broken down into annual components. </p><p>Progress towards the child poverty is monitored in the Social Inclusion Monitor.  The 2013 Monitor indicates that c 100,000 children have to be lifted out of consistent poverty to meet the target by 2020.</p><p>In support of the target, the Government is implementing a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty, building on the life-cycle approach in the <i>National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, 2007-2016</i>and informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;<i>Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage</i>&rsquo;. A range of government departments and other stakeholders are involved in implementing this approach. </p><p>In Budget 2016, the Government committed over &euro;200 million to support families with children through higher income supports and increased provision of early childhood care and education and other forms of childcare. The social impact assessment of Budget 2016 shows that households with children are the biggest beneficiaries, in particular working lone parents. The published data does not yet go beyond 2013 so it does not reflect these measures.</p><p><b>Consistent poverty rates for children, 2009 to 2013</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2013</div></th></tr><tr><td>Percentage (%)</td><td><div>8.7</div></td><td><div>8.8</div></td><td><div>9.3</div></td><td><div>9.9</div></td><td><div>11.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Number (&lsquo;000s)</td><td><div>97</div></td><td><div>99</div></td><td><div>107</div></td><td><div>115</div></td><td><div>138</div></td></tr></table>Source: CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions, 2009-2013</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives from the SFA, ISME and Chambers Ireland, whose membership encompasses the hotel sector, to discuss issues around access to finance.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office release &quot;Overseas Travel July-September 2015&quot;) shows that in the period January to September 2015, there were over 6.64 million visits to Ireland.  Overall trips to Ireland were up 12.5% in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.  For the three-month period from July to September 2015, overseas trips to Ireland increased by 13.5%.</p><p>Tourism delivers income and jobs in every town and city in the country. The reduction in VAT to 9% in the tourism sector and the abolition of the air travel tax improved Ireland's competitiveness.  The 9% VAT rate is a major benefit to the tourism sector and is much sought after by other sectors in the economy.  I announced changes to the Employment and Investment Incentive scheme last year subject to compliance with European State Aid provisions. With specific regard to the hospitality sector, I extended the inclusion of hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation in the scheme by a further 3 years.  The benefit of these policies can be seen in tourist numbers, new businesses, the survival of established businesses and, most of all, in employment.</p><p>Turning to the banking sector, AIB and Bank of Ireland are concentrating on growing their balance sheets.  In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector. </p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses. The SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance, and includes representation from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  </p><p>Some of the main policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:</p><p>-The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at </p><p>-The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.  In the last number of weeks the SBCI announced the first non-bank finance partnership with Finance Ireland worth &euro;50 million and the second non-bank partnership with Merrion Fleet providing an additional &euro;25 million in funding to SMEs. Non-bank finance is a vital source of funding to a growing economy.  The SBCI has reached a significant milestone as &euro;110 million has now been drawn down by 3,200 SMEs. More information on the SBCI can be found on .</p><p>-The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has recently brought legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included. </p><p>-The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund)</p><p>-The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer John Trethowan and his team have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at </p><p>My Department, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, it is expected that the forthcoming Action Plan for Jobs 2016 will include a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support financing for growth in the SME sector.</p></reply>

The approved reorganisation allows for a redemption of the 2009 Preference Shares, to the value of &euro;1.7 billion for the State, as well as a conversion of the remaining Preferences Shares into ordinary equity. This is a key step in returning capital to the taxpayer, in recognition of the significant investment made in the bank during the financial crisis, while it also regularises the bank's capital structure making it compliant with new regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  In relation to future returns, the State's &euro;3.5 billion of preference shares delivered a cash dividend of &euro;280m earlier this year and a further payment of accrued dividend will be made on conversion/redemption of the shares in the coming months to reflect the dividend outstanding at that time.</p>  <p>  Next year, the Contingent Capital Notes, or "CoCos", which were issued by the State to AIB in July 2011 are due to mature. At this point the State can expect to receive their full value of &euro;1.6 billion, plus a full year of accrued interest amounting to &euro;160 million in cash.</p>  <p>  With regards to any future payment of dividends on Ordinary Shares, this is a matter for the Board of AIB and their regulator. However, following the capital reorganisation and with AIB now returned to sustainable  profitability, I believe it is reasonable to assume that the bank could begin to being start paying a dividend to shareholders at some point next year. I cannot be specific about the exact timing and quantum of any dividends however, given the fiduciary and regulatory obligations involved. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, any decision in relation to the ultimate sale of the State shareholding in AIB will be a matter for the next Government.  </p>  <p>  As previously indicated, all capital returned from the State's investments in the Irish banks, will be used to reduce the national debt.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e.the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the "Group threshold" below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.  There is also an annual small gifts exemption of &euro;3,000.</p>  <p>  The details supplied describe a situation in which two siblings have inherited a house jointly from their mother.  Based on the date of death of the disponer, this means that a tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000 applies to each inheritor.  If neither of them had previously received gifts or inheritances from a parent beyond the annual small gifts amount this means that, between them, they would be entitled to receive &euro;450,000 tax-free before the application of CAT, on the basis that neither of them is eligible for the dwelling house exemption which applies in many cases where an individual inherits the property in which they live.</p>  <p>  The dwelling house exemption allows an individual to inherit the property in which they live free of CAT, subject to certain conditions.  One of these is that the individual has no beneficial interest in another residential property.  The reason for this is that the exemption is designed to prevent hardship in cases where individuals are sharing a home and where one or more individuals are bequeathed the home in circumstances where they would otherwise have to sell the property in order to pay a CAT liability and be left without a home.  This situation does not arise when an inheritor also owns other residential property or properties.  I have no plans to modify the requirements of the dwelling house exemption to remove this condition.  The core principle that the exemption is designed to prevent hardship in the case of home sharers is not satisfied where an individual owns other residential property. </p>  <p>  Concern is raised in the details supplied regarding the ability to pay the tax.  In this regard, an inheritor of land or buildings is entitled to pay any inheritance tax due by instalments over a period of five years, subject to interest.  The Revenue Commissioners also have the discretion to allow payment over a longer period, delayed payment and/or the waiving of interest in cases of genuine hardship.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2016, I raised the Group A threshold applying to gifts and inheritances from parents to their children from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000. This represents an increase of about 25%.  I did this in recognition of the improving state of the national finances and of the concerns expressed to me by people making and receiving gifts and inheritances, particularly in a context of rising property prices.  The scale of the increase may not be considered sufficient by some but it is a significant change and as much as could be afforded at this time.  I have, however, indicated that I see the change to the Group A tax- free threshold in this year's Budget as the start of a process.  Provided, among other factors, that our economic recovery continues, I will examine the scope for further improvements in the tax-free thresholds in the future</p></reply>

All schemes must provide this standard level of flood protection in order to be approved.</p>  <p>  An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is completed for nearly all large flood relief schemes and the EIS must identify and assess the direct and indirect effects of the proposed works. Once a preferred scheme is determined on any given project, the proposals are brought before the public through a consultation process which gives the public an opportunity to comment and make submissions on the proposed works. </p>  <p>  In order for a scheme to proceed it must be generally acceptable to the public in the area where it is proposed to be implemented.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the foregoing, the height and appearance of flood defence walls are very important elements in the design of flood relief schemes and the OPW strives always to achieve the appropriate balance between the absolute requirement to have a scheme which delivers the standard of protection needed while also providing a scheme which is aesthetically pleasing and acceptable to the community it serves particularly in areas of beauty and amenity.</p></reply>

Shannon Foynes Port Company (SFPC) has statutory responsibility for all commercial maritime activities on the Shannon Estuary.  A Strategic Integrated Framework Plan (SIFP) for the Shannon Estuary was developed by Clare County Council, Kerry County Council, Limerick City and County Councils, Shannon Development (now part of the Shannon Group ) and Shannon Foynes Port Company and published in November 2013.  Implementation of the plan is overseen by a multi-agency Steering Group comprising of:</p><p>- Clare County Council (lead authority)</p><p>- Kerry County Council</p><p>- Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</p><p>- Shannon Commercial Properties</p><p>- Shannon Foynes Port Company</p><p>- National Parks and Wildlife Service</p><p>- Marine Institute</p><p>- Environmental Protection Agency</p><p>- Office of Public Works</p><p>- National Monuments Service</p><p>- Limerick Clare Energy Agency</p><p>- Inland Fisheries Ireland</p><p>- EirGrid</p><p>- Shannon Airport</p><p>- Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</p><p>- Shannon International River Basin District Project</p><p>The plan identified key strategic locations for industrial development which take into account the fact that the entire Estuary is also designated a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) &ndash; a wildlife conservation area, considered to be important on a European as well as Irish level &ndash; under the Habitats Directive.  A large part of the estuary &ndash; around the Fergus Estuary &ndash; is also designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) &ndash; as part of a network of sites across Europe that are protected under the Birds Directive.</p><p>The Shannon Estuary is home to a number of large industries and employers including ESB Moneypoint, Aughinish Alumina, Tarbert Power Station and Shannon Airport.  As further key strategic locations become zoned for development, these sites will become available for appropriate development and will be marketed by the IDA for Marine related activities.</p><p>Shannon LNG currently has on option with Shannon Commercial Properties to buy a site in Ballylongford, Shannon Commercial Property is part of the Shannon Group which comes under the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourist and Sport.  Energy Policy comes under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p><p>The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative was launched in February of this year and aims to identify a range of actions which will help each region to achieve its economic potential.  The Mid-West Action Plan for Jobs, which covers the Shannon region, was published on 19th October.  Led by my Department, the Plan is the fourth of 8 regional jobs plans to be published as part of a new &euro;250 million regional jobs strategy, and aims to deliver employment growth of 10-15% in the region by 2020.</p></reply>

Figures for 2015 will be available in 2016.</p><p>In the period 2011-2014, there were a total of 653 investments approved by IDA Ireland, not all of which will receive grant support.  In 2014, 197 investments were approved equating to a 20% increase on 2013.</p><p>In its mid-year statement, IDA Ireland announced that Ireland continued to win a strong share of global investment for regional locations in the first half of 2015, despite intense international competition and economic uncertainty in Europe. In the first half of the year, IDA Ireland approved 110 investment projects, which will lead to the creation of 9,000 direct jobs this year and over future years as the companies gradually roll-out their investment plans. In the same period in 2014, there were 100 projects leading to 8,000 jobs. Among the companies publicly announcing investment plans in Ireland in the first half of 2015 were Apple, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson Vision Care, Northern Trust, Facebook , Agora Publishing, Viagogo, Zimmer, ABEC Inc. and Zalando. Ireland is also investing in a &euro;150 M Regional Property Programme over a five-year period to ensure that there is sufficient availability of utility-intensive strategic sites, quality business parks and advance building solutions to attract investment in to the regions.</p><p>So far this year, advance technology buildings have been completed in both Waterford and Athlone and the construction of buildings in Sligo, Castlebar and Tralee is at an advanced stage of procurement. Next year, IDA Ireland will continue this programme of advance builds with projects in Galway, Dundalk and Limerick. Investment in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s portfolio of business and technology parks around the country is also underway.</p><p>Each year, Science Foundation Ireland allocates in the region of &euro;150 million to &euro;160 million of research funding to researchers across Ireland&rsquo;s higher education system based on open, internationally peer-reviewed calls for proposals.  This funding makes up part of the capital expenditure of my Department.  SFI research awards are typically multi-annual awards (i.e. drawn down over a period of 2 to 5 years depending on the nature of the Call).</p><p>All SFI research funding is channelled to designated research performing organisations in Ireland &ndash; universities, colleges and other research institutes and this is reflected in the county by county breakdown provided below.  The &euro;911.9 million of capital funding presented below relates to all &ldquo;live awards&rdquo; on the SFI system (i.e. funding for projects that are underway but not yet completed). [Note: the data in the following table 2 include a number of awards for projects that were active earlier in 2015 which have now been completed.]</p><p>There are two capital projects funded through my Department by the North/South Interreg Programme:</p><p>County Donegal: Contribution to construction costs of Science Park in Letterkenny Institute of Technology &euro;1.013 m</p><p>County Leitrim: Contribution to construction costs of Enterprise Centre in Carrick on Shannon &euro;0.267 m</p><p>Funding approvals to Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2015 are set out in the following table 3.  Small grants include feasibility grants, consultancy grants, new market research grants, small training grants and some key manager grants. Payments to Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2015 are set out in the following table 4.

This is at the heart of the Action Plan for Jobs process and has been a central feature of successive Budgets and The Pathways to Work programme.  This level of policy focus has helped create an environment where 126,000 extra people are at work, all regions are increasing employment and our economy is the fastest growing in the EU.  In the context of the above enterprise and jobs performance it should be noted that one of the first decisions this Government made was to reverse the &euro;1 cut in the national minimum wage implemented by the previous Government.  In the context of the minimum wage, the report from the Low Pay Commission which supported the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the appropriate rate for the National Minimum Wage (NMW) stated that research indicates that moderate increases in the NMW are unlikely to have a significantly adverse effect on employment.</p><p>The Commission recommended that anomalies in relation to PRSI which could adversely affect employer costs should be addressed, and I believe that the adjustments to PRSI which have been provided for by my colleague, Minister Noonan, in the recent Budget, will assist employers in reducing costs, thus ensuring a continuing positive climate for job creation.</p><p>Budget Documentation available at the following link gives the example (Example 6 page B.22) of an individual earning the minimum wage of &euro;8.65 for a 39 hour week in 2015. The minimum wage increase will mean an additional &euro;1,014 per annum for this person, taking their gross income to &euro;18,556 in 2016. Their income tax liability will increase from &euro;208 per annum to &euro;411 per annum due to their additional earnings. They will have a PRSI liability of &euro;160. USC liability reduces from &euro;374 to &euro;317. The net gain for this person is &euro;708 per annum or 4.2%.</p><p>Due to the budget changes introduced the employer will pay PRSI at 8.5% and not move to the previously higher rate of 10.75% when paying the additional &euro;1,014 per annum. This reduces the additional PRSI paid by an employer to &euro;86.19 per annum.</p><p>PRSI changes (New PRSI relief of &euro;12 per week for employees and increase in employer threshold)</p><p>Application where someone earns the new NMW of &euro;9.15 per hour (39 hour week = &euro;18,556 per annum)</p><p>The maximum PRSI relief is &euro;12 a week, applied on wages of &euro;352 a week. So instead of paying &euro;14.08 a week PRSI the person will pay &euro;2.08 a week.</p><p>The PRSI relief is gradually reduced as wages rise to &euro;424 a week - for every &euro;12 rise in weekly wage the relief is reduced by &euro;2.<table><tr><th>Weekly wage</th><th>Hourly rate</th><th>Old PRSI</th><th>Relief</th><th>New PRSI</th><th>Old Annual PRSI</th><th>New Annual PRSI</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>352.00</td><td>9.03</td><td>14.08</td><td>12.00</td><td>2.08</td><td>732.16</td><td>108.16</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>356.85</td><td>9.15</td><td>14.27</td><td>11.19</td><td>3.08</td><td>742.04</td><td>160.16</td><td>NMW</td></tr><tr><td>364.00</td><td>9.33</td><td>14.56</td><td>10.00</td><td>4.56</td><td>757.12</td><td>237.12</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>376.00</td><td>9.64</td><td>15.04</td><td>8.00</td><td>7.04</td><td>782.08</td><td>366.08</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>388.00</td><td>9.95</td><td>15.52</td><td>6.00</td><td>9.52</td><td>807.04</td><td>495.04</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>400.00</td><td>10.26</td><td>16.00</td><td>4.00</td><td>12.00</td><td>832.00</td><td>624.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>412.00</td><td>10.56</td><td>16.48</td><td>2.00</td><td>14.48</td><td>856.96</td><td>752.96</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>424.00</td><td>10.87</td><td>16.96</td><td>-</td><td>16.96</td><td>881.92</td><td>881.92</td><td>-</td></tr></table>Annual PRSI Cost to Employee on new NMW (working 39 hours p.w.) without the proposed change would be &euro;742.04 (&euro;18,556 * 4%), giving a saving of &euro;581.88 even with the new payment of &euro;160.</p><p>Employer impact - increase in threshold for change of rate from 8.5% to 10.75% from &euro;356.01 to &euro;376.01<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Weekly NMW</th><th>PRSI rate</th><th>Weekly cost</th><th>No of weeks</th><th>Annual Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Increase of rate to &euro;376 before 10.75% applies</td><td>356.85</td><td>8.50%</td><td>30.33</td><td>52</td><td>1,577.28</td></tr><tr><td>Cost to employer prior to Budget change  </td><td>356.85</td><td>10.75%</td><td>38.36</td><td>52</td><td>1,994.79</td></tr><tr><td>Difference</td><td></td><td></td><td>8.03</td><td>52</td><td>417.51</td></tr></table>Annual PRSI Cost to Employer without the proposed change would be &euro;1,994.79, giving a saving of &euro;417.51.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1.</sup>(There is an additional saving to Employer also for employees earning up to &euro;9.64 per hour/&euro;376 p.w., who previously would have invoked the 10.75% rate - annual saving to the employer of &euro;439.92 for an employee earning &euro;376 per week).</p></reply>

The 2014 Direct Payments application of the person named was selected for a Remote Sensing inspection.  Initial processing of this inspection identified over-claims of between 3% and 20% the person named was notified of this outcome on 29 November 2014.  Payments due on the basis set out above issued to the nominated bank account of the person named the advance payment in 4 November 2014 with the balancing payment issuing on 1 December 2014.</p>  <p>  The person named sought a review of this decision and a field inspection was deemed necessary.  This subsequent field visit, to verify the position on the ground, identified discrepancies between the area declared and the area determined resulting in an over-declaration in area of greater than 20%.  Based on the terms and conditions of the scheme this resulted in no payment being due under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme.  The person named was notified of the outcome of this field visit by letter issued on 25 June 2015. The person named sought a review of this decision.  The review was completed by the District Inspector the result of which was to uphold the original decision.  The person named was notified of this decision on 1 September 2015.  The person named has appealed this decision to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and the appeal is currently being examined.  The person named will be notified of the outcome of the appeal on completion of the appeal process.  In the event that the person named considers that they have been treated unfairly by the Appeals Office they can raise the matter with the Office of the Ombudsman.   </p>  <p>  As payment had already issued under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme, my Department is required to recover any over-payment from future payments issuing to an applicant.  In this case the over-payment for 2014 was recovered from payments due to the person named under the 2015 Direct Payments Schemes.</p>  <p>  In the event that the outcome of a review of the independent Agriculture Appeals Office decision results in monies being due under the Single Payment Scheme, payment of any such amounts will be processed and issued to the person named on completion of the review process.  In addition, any monies recovered from other scheme payments in respect of the original overpayment will be refunded to the person named.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, I am informed by the military authorities that risk assessments are carried out for all mission areas. These risk assessments are intended to identify all hazards that might exist in a mission area, including health risks. Suitable control measures are then put in place to minimise identified risks. Where a health risk is identified the control measures will include preventative medication where appropriate. </p>  <p>  Where malaria has been identified as a risk, the choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues. The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces on the basis of best international practice having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications. Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications. It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces policy in relation to the use of anti-malarial medication is in line with current Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) approved summary of product characteristics (SmPC).</p>  <p>  Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam, remains in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas mission, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by Malaria.</p></reply>

As part of its remit the Group is reviewing the use of the Primaquine drug in the Defence Forces and the overall medical treatment process for those deployed to malarious areas. The Group will report back to me with its findings. The reason the Deputy has not received the information sought to date is that matters are still being examined by the Group. However without pre-empting the outcome of the review, I can inform the Deputy that I am advised that Primaquine is not used as an anti-malarial medication by Defence Forces personnel while in a mission area. Primaquine is prescribed to Defence Forces personnel for two weeks when they return from deployment to a &ldquo;malarious&rdquo; area regardless of the malaria chemoprophylaxis they had been taking during their deployment.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that Primaquine is prescribed in order to kill the dormant &ldquo;hypnozoite&rdquo; phase of malaria parasite which, if not killed, would have the potential weeks, months or years after returning home to give rise to a full-blown attack of malaria. The Director of the Medical Branch of the Defence Forces has indicated that Primaquine is unique in its action in that regard.</p></reply>

The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.</p><p>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a Constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325</i>effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a Constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. </i>As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that a new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is currently being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Legislative provisions under consideration include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, enable the Board to verify the means of applicants and to provide for prosecution of cases of abuse.</p><p>In respect of sentencing, the legislature generally sets out the maximum sentence that can be imposed and it is then a matter for the judiciary to decide what is the appropriate sentence in a particular case taking into account all the circumstances.  There is however, a mandatory sentence for murder and presumptive minimum sentences for a number of offences.</p><p>The Law Reform Commission looked at the issue of mandatory sentences in detail in their report LRC108-2013.  They were in favour of retaining the mandatory sentence for murder.  However they were of the view that for other offences, mandatory sentencing regimes are too rigid and have not been shown to be effective in reducing offending.  They recommended that presumptive minimum sentences should not be extended and that existing provisions should be repealed.</p><p>The Strategic Review of Penal Policy report published in July 2014 made a number of recommendations about sentencing.  In particular they recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences be introduced and existing provisions should be reviewed.</p><p>I am looking at the question of sentencing legislation in the light of these two reports.</p></reply>

The intention was to have robust procedures in place which would give prisoners access to a credible complaints system that deals with genuine complaints in an open, transparent and independent way.</p>  <p>  The system is categorised depending on the nature of the complaint.  Category A complaints concern the most serious level of complaint (assault, serious intimidation by staff etc.).  Category B complaints include allegations of discrimination, verbal abuse by officers and inappropriate searches.  Category C complaints are essentially service complaints where a prisoner is unhappy with the level of service in a particular prison.  Category D complaints are those alleging misconduct or mistreatment by professionals providing services to prisoners such as doctors, dentists etc.</p>  <p>  In January 2013 the then Minister announced amendments to the Prison Rules to support and give effect to the new procedures for the investigation of prisoner complaints.  In the main, the amendments to the Prison Rules provide that prisoner complaints under Category A will be examined by investigators from outside the Prison Service to ensure an effective and impartial investigation.  The complainant will be kept informed and the reports by outside investigators are automatically submitted to the Governor in question, the Director General and the Inspector of Prisons.  The Inspector of Prisons has had oversight of the process from the very beginning which was also strengthened by extra resources assigned to his office.</p>  <p>  A panel of 22 external investigators were recruited and since the introduction of the complaints procedure in November 2012 (to end March 2015) there have been 240 Category A complaints investigated under the new system.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Inspector of Prisons is a statutory, independent office established under the Prisons Act, 2007.  As part of his oversight of the complaints process, the Inspector is in the process of reviewing the prisoner complaints procedure currently in operation and the outcome of that review will be presented to me on completion.</p></reply>

(1) of the Constitution allows for the establishment of special courts in accordance with the law in cases where it is considered that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  Section 38 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 provides for the establishment of Special Criminal Courts.  Section 38 of the 1939 Act as amended also provides that the Government may, whenever they consider it necessary or desirable to do so, establish additional Special Criminal Courts as they think fit.  It also provides that whenever two or more Special Criminal Courts are in existence the Government may, if and so often as they think fit, reduce the number of such Courts and abolish those existing Courts that appear to be redundant.</p>  <p>  There is a backlog of cases in the existing Special Criminal Court with delays of approximately twenty months in cases coming to trial.  Bearing this in mind, together with the particular types of offences with which the Special Criminal Court is concerned, I sought the necessary Government approval to appoint judges to the second Special Criminal Court, thereby bringing it into existence.</p>  <p>  However it does not necessarily mean that more cases will be referred to the Special Criminal Courts but that cases will be dealt with more quickly.  The Deputy will be aware that the decision as to whether a particular case will be prosecuted before the Special Criminal Court is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who is by law independent of the Government.</p>  <p>  I anticipate that when the second Special Criminal Court commences hearing cases there will be a reduction in waiting times for cases awaiting trial.  The Government considers that there are good reasons for two Special Criminal Courts.  However the requirement for two Special Criminal Courts will be kept under review in this context and I have no plans at present to abolish the Special Criminal Court.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. Children whose third birthday is on or after 1 July 2012 are below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016/17 programme year. </p>  <p>  The recent Budget decisions, which introduced an extended provision under the ECCE programme that allows children to access the free pre-school programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school, come into effect from September 2016. This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefiting from the programme, which is estimated to increase from 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that, depending on their date of birth, some children enrolling in the ECCE programme in September 2016 will not benefit from this extended free pre-school provision. I am also aware that, when the programme is fully in place (i.e. from 2017), there will be some children who will benefit for a shorter extra period of free pre-school than others. Again, this will depend on the child's date of birth and the age at which they make the transition to primary school. Ultimately however, when this extended programme is fully in place, all children will be better off than in the present programme. Indeed, the net effect of the improvements for children overall will be an increase of an average of 23 weeks over the current programme.  I think that this is a significant step forward for children and their families.</p></reply>

This delivers on a commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementias strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017. This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12million, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5million.</p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society. </p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p> - the rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home-care Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p> - the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia. The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points, etc.</p>  <p> - measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme. This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers, and advocates. The Group also includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia. The most recent meeting of this Monitoring Group was held on 24 September 2015.</p></reply>

The call was classed as life-threatening. At the time the call was received, the NAS was dealing with a number of other emergency calls; however, the nearest available emergency resources were immediately dispatched to the incident. A rapid response vehicle, crewed by an advanced paramedic, arrived at the scene at 3:29 a.m. An emergency ambulance arrived at 3:45 a.m.</p>  <p>  While the emergency paramedics were en route, the NAS call taker stayed on the telephone line and gave emergency first aid instructions to the caller. On arrival, the paramedics did everything they could to help the patient, including advanced life support interventions and attempted resuscitation.  Regrettably the patient passed away.</p>  <p>  I am advised that in line with normal procedure following an adverse incident, all matters relating to the response of the NAS in this case are being reviewed. The review will involve every aspect of the response process, from initial receipt of the call and triaging, through to clinical treatment at the scene. </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that the Government is committed to the improvement of our ambulance services. A significant reform programme is underway to reconfigure the way pre-hospital care services are managed and delivered. To this end, the NAS received an increase of &euro;5.4m in funding in 2015, to improve technology and clinical audit and address gaps in service. Further additional funding will be provided to the NAS in 2016.</p></reply>

These included clear and positive action by local leaders; security measures that were proportionate and even-handed; a response that went beyond just security; refraining from provocative words and actions, and making clear that the status quo in the Holy Places would be respected. On the wider context, I stressed the absolute necessity of an end to the relentless pressure of settlement expansion on Palestinians, and of a political path that held out hope to Palestinians for an end to the occupation.The European Union can encourage all these ideas, but only local leaders and communities can restore calm in the current unrest in Jerusalem, Hebron and other cities.    The Foreign Affairs Council next week will certainly consider the specific context of recent violence, but I expect it to focus on the wider aspects which have generated the unrest, and consider what the EU can do on these. These are the themes which Ireland has consistently stressed for a long time.</p>  <p>  In addition, I expect that this week the European Commission will publish an interpretive notice on the labelling of goods originating in the occupied territories.  While this is clarification of the existing rules, rather than the introduction of new rules, publication of the notice is consistent with the EU approach of differentiating relations with Israel from the relationship with the Occupied Territories.</p></reply>

However my Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years.</p>  <p>  Under these Circulars School Principals must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have had to engage a registered teacher who is retired. Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.</p>  <p>  A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale (i.e. the lowest point or starting salary for teachers). Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable. This measure represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014. </p><p>  It is important to note that each school's allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school.  New students with care needs may, or may not, enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations may be decreased where a child's care needs have diminished over time.  </p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  </p><p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March 2015.  The NCSE also continued to accept applications after this date in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.</p><p>  The NCSE has published details of SNA allocations for schools for September 2015 on its website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The website indicates that the school in question had an allocation of 12 whole time equivalent (WTE) SNA posts in the 2014/15 school year and has retained the same allocation of SNA posts for the 2015/16 school year.</p><p>  I understand that the NCSE recently visited the school on foot of an enquiry received from the school authorities in relation to its SNA allocation and, having considered all available information, has determined that the SNA allocation for the school for 2015/16 is a sufficient level of support to cater for the care needs of all qualifying children enrolled in the school.</p><p>  I understand also that the SENO has met with parents of pupils attending the school to discuss the allocation process and has informed the school of the appeal process which applies in relation to SNA allocations.</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.

However, Minister of State Coffey and I jointly wrote to the Chief Executives of the four Dublin Local Authorities on 10 June 2015 in the context of their role in preparing and finalising the development plans for their areas.  At that time my Department&rsquo;s analysis and that of the Dublin Housing Supply and Co-ordination Task Force was that there was sufficient supply of land to meet immediate housing requirements and that proposals to zone any additional residential land would have to be strongly evidentially grounded and consistent with core strategies. </p><p>We strongly encouraged the Chief Executives to focus around practical measures that can be adopted to boost housing supply and to ensure that good quality housing in suitable locations is available at affordable prices. I firmly believe that increasing supply is key to addressing the range of housing issues we face today. </p><p>As you will be already aware the <i>Housing Supply Coordination Taskforce for Dublin, with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues</i>, was convened by my Department and includes representatives of the four Dublin local authorities. The First Report of the Task Force undertook an analysis of planning permissions in place for developments of 20 housing units or more and concluded that across the four Dublin authorities there is land immediately available with planning permission for development of 12,785 houses and 7,925 apartments, equating to circa. 3 years supply. A further 25,507 units were deemed permissible in the immediate to short term.</p><p>A further study of additional zoned residential lands that could be brought on stream by the Task Force has examined infrastructural constraints and has identified specific infrastructural interventions possible to facilitate additional housing supply in the Dublin Region, which will inform investment planning cycles of relevant Government Departments, Agencies and other infrastructure providers such as Irish Water.</p><p>Finally, I have just announced a range of initiatives to be implemented from January, including enhanced supply of more affordable starter homes in key locations through a targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels, and New National Apartment Planning Guidelines to be issued by me, which will have the effect of reducing the cost of apartment building in Dublin City by approximately &euro;20,000 per unit, on average.</p><p>These measures will combine with previous announcements, including the introduction of a vacant site levy, new Part V arrangements and 20,000 starter homes for the Greater Dublin area to be funded by NAMA. Combined they make badly needed new housing development in our urban centres much more economically viable. </p></reply>

This mitigation package involves the purchase, by ESB, and release of eels into the sea and the extension of ESB&rsquo;s highly successful &ldquo;trap and transport&rdquo; programme on the Erne to carry eels around the Hydro Electric Plant at Cathaleen&rsquo;s Fall. The issues were, therefore resolved via dialogue and consensus.</p>  <p>   In addition to the need for mitigation, a key consideration was minimising the risk of a recurrence of such events. In that regard, new protocols defining roles and responsibilities for the capture and transport of elvers around the dams at Ballyshannon have been agreed by ESB with both DCAL and Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI). Staff from both Government organisations will assist in overseeing the monitoring of elver traps and the subsequent overland transport of them by ESB on the Erne catchment</p>  <p>  In contemplation of a mitigation strategy, both Departments consulted with, and followed the advice of, the Standing Scientific Committee on Eels, a statutorily independent advisory committee, comprising scientists from Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  I also understand that ESB have made a number of physical improvements and considerable investment in a full upgrade of elver trapping facilities to the latest available technology at Cathaleen&rsquo;s Fall. This upgrade ensures enhanced aeration and storage facilities for collected elvers before release and both IFI and DCAL are content that this has been operating effectively in the 2015 season. </p>  <p>  ESB acted on the technology upgrade very quickly and a key element of the mitigation agreement also includes a commitment by ESB and both Departments, to keep the operational and management matters under review in the light of future developments in technology.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Culture Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland and I jointly welcomed the mitigation measures, the revised protocols and the fact that ESB acted responsibly in terms of mitigation.</p></reply>

The most recent CSO Quarterly Tourism and Travel publication shows that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding air fares or ferry charges) for the first half of 2015 increased by 16.2%, compared to the same 6-month period in 2014.</p><p>Research that has been carried out on behalf of the tourism agencies and tourism industry has found that certain market segments have a higher likelihood to select Ireland as a destination. Tourism Ireland's overseas marketing activity is weighted towards these segments in order to provide the best return on marketing investment.</p><p>In addition, the tourism brand experiences that have been developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, for example the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, and the new brand experience for Dublin &ndash; A Breath of Fresh Air &ndash; are all constructed to meet the needs of the most promising consumer segments in overseas source markets.</p><p>The Government's Tourism Policy Statement &quot;People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025&quot; was launched in March of this year. The main targets contained in the Tourism Policy Statement, to be achieved by 2025, are as follows:</p><p>-Overseas tourism revenue to increase to &euro;5 billion net of inflation, compared to &euro;3.5 billion in 2014;</p><p>-Overseas visits to Ireland to increase to ten million, compared to 7.6 million in 2014; and</p><p>-250,000 people to be employed in the tourism sector, compared to 205,000 at present.</p><p>Earlier this year, I appointed a Tourism Leadership Group, to put in place a Tourism Action Plan that will set out the actions required in the period to 2018 to achieve the overall objectives in &quot;People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025&quot;.  I intend to publish the Tourism Action Plan in the first quarter of 2016.</p></reply>

The statistics indicate that the country as a whole has sufficient stock of tourist accommodation to meet the needs of the industry.  However, regarding hotel accommodation specifically, analysis of recent occupancy trends and the impact of increasing demand indicates that we will require additional capacity in some parts of the country - particularly Dublin City Centre.  According to F&aacute;ilte Ireland's most recent accommodation occupancy statistics, for January to August 2015, hotel room occupancy in Dublin stood at 75%, whereas hotel occupancy outside Dublin was 66%.  Three years ago, survey results for the same 9-month period in 2013 indicated hotel occupancy levels of 69% in Dublin and 59% elsewhere, although changes in 2015 to the way data is collected and analysed may affect comparability with previous years.  With regard to other forms of accommodation, occupancy rates in the first nine months of 2015 were mostly higher in Dublin than elsewhere in Ireland, although the reverse was the case for caravan and camping sites and self-catering.  Further details on occupancy rates including details from previous years is available on Failte Ireland's website at . </p><p>​To broaden our understanding of the situation and inform consideration of appropriate responses, I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has commissioned an assessment of the potential supply of visitor accommodation in Dublin up to 2020 compared to likely demand under several different growth scenarios and this report is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Works on the re-opening of the Phoenix Park Tunnel will be completed next year.  Together with the completion of resignalling works between Connolly and Grand Canal Dock in 2016, the project will allow regular commuter trains operate through the Phoenix Park Tunnel for the first time, and increasing the number of train services which can operate on the line between Connolly and Grand Canal Dock.  Services on the Kildare commuter line will be a mix of Kildare to Dublin Heuston and Kildare to Grand Canal Dock services, offering new more direct connections to commuters.  These new services will commence in Autumn 2016.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are actively examining a proposal to increase the DART frequency to 10 minutes in the peak commencing early in 2016 to improve the service to customers and that the necessary funding issues involved are being considered at present.</p>  <p>  In the longer term, the Capital Plan will also see the commencement of the the first phase of a multi-phase DART expansion programme, with the extension of the DART line to Balbriggan and with design and planning to progress for expansion of DART services to Maynooth in the west and Hazelhatch in the south west.  The Dart Underground Project, which remains a key element of integrated transport for the GDA over the longer term, will be redesigned to provide a lower cost technical solution, whilst retaining the required rail connectivity. </p></reply>
