Estimates of employment are produced by NUTS 3 Regions.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>The NUTS 3 South-West region includes Cork City and County and County Kerry. Due to methodology and sample size it is not possible to produce reliable estimates for the County of Kerry from the QNHS as the survey is not designed to produce reliable County level data. The production of such detailed County estimates would require a large increase in sample size and, as a result, there would be a significant increase in the cost of administering the survey. There are therefore no plans to introduce these detailed County estimates from the QNHS at this time.</p><p>It can be noted that the 5 yearly Census of Population may be used to produce a range of Statistics at County level. The next Census of Population is due to be conducted on April 24th 2016. </p></reply>

A number of staff working in my Department have indicated that they have proficiency in Irish and are competent to provide service to customers in Irish to varying degrees.  Indeed, my Department's Customer Charter states that customers who wish to conduct their business through Irish will be accommodated.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Government policy, my Department's Official Languages Scheme 2016 - 2019 (under the Official Languages Act) specifies two Designated Irish Language Posts in my Department - one in my Private Office and one in the Government Press Office.

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2016 Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;85 million on the farm assist scheme.</p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons.  Farm families with the lowest income were least impacted by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist were maintained.</p>  <p>  In December last all long term welfare recipients, including recipients of farm assist, benefitted from a 75% Christmas Bonus payment.  All recipients of farm assist with children are benefitting from the &euro;5 increase in child benefit rates payable from the start of this year.  In addition, farm assist recipients eligible for the fuel allowance will gain from the increase of &euro;2.50 per week, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week over the fuel season.</p>  <p>  All measures introduced, including proposals relating to the farm assist scheme, are assessed and analysed in terms of the impact they have.  Farm assist is kept under ongoing review from a policy and an administrative point of view by my officials.  Farmers affected by the who will suffer a severe deterioration in their annual income can apply for farm assist, subject to satisfying the usual rules of the scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-03-22a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016032200065#WRA00800"><p>The overall concern of the Government in its Budgets has been to protect the primary social welfare rates.  Expenditure on pensions at approximately &euro;6.974 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approx. 35.5% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  The Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;84 million in 2016 for the increasing number of pensioners.</p>  <p>  The household benefits package (HHB) comprises the electricity or gas allowance, and the free television licence.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on the household benefits package benefitting over 419,000 customers.  There are no plans to upgrade or increase payments made under the household benefits package at this time.</p>  <p>  There have been no cuts to the State Pension in any recent budgets. In Budget 2016, I was able to announce the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.  This increases the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  I was also pleased to announce a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate and increasing funding to the Free Travel Scheme, the impact of Budget 2016 has been very positive for older people.</p></reply>

The person referred to by the Deputy has been paying class D contributions with the HSE since 1990.  I have no information which suggests that she was paying the wrong class of PRSI.</p>  <p>  While class D contributors are not entitled to a State pension, they are entitled to a public sector pension from their employer.  Class D contributions do not entitle a person to a State pension because the contributions are significantly less than for workers in the private sector who pay class A.  The employer contribution for a class A contributor is up 10.75 percent. For a class D contributor the employer contribution is 2.35 percent.</p>  <p>  PRSI contributions are paid into the Social Insurance Fund which is used to fund the various schemes administered by the Department.</p>  <p>  The social welfare payments that may be covered by class D contributions, subject to the particular qualifying conditions for each scheme being met, include carer&rsquo;s benefit, occupational injury benefit, guardian&rsquo;s payment, and the contributory widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension.</p></reply>

The function involves the provision of impartial medical opinion for the guidance of Deciding Officers in determining entitlements to the various medical related schemes operated by the DSP.</p><p>Medical eligibility is a critical condition of certain DSP schemes.  The Medical Assessors work in a collegiate way to ensure that best practice and professional expertise is shared and applied across all of the cases that are reviewed by them.  This includes daily case conference meetings and a medical research unit to actively engage in the update of the body of medical knowledge and evidence based practice.</p><p>When conducting an assessment, the Medical Assessor does not dispute the existence of the certified cause of incapacity but rather he/she assesses the degree to which the loss of function in work-related activities, resulting from disease, mental health disorder or injury, affects the person&rsquo;s ability to perform either their own job or alternative types of work.

The SIF operates on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis, with the Exchequer acting as residual financier of the fund when there is a shortfall between contributions received and benefits paid.</p>  <p>  In a difficult economic environment such as Ireland faced in the recent past, the choices facing Government in order to ensure the sustainability of the Fund were to either increase the rate of contributions or reduce benefits, and in this instance, the decision was made to increase the number of &ldquo;waiting days&rdquo; to qualify for illness benefit from three to six.</p>  <p>  Many employees receive their salaries when out sick where their employers have occupational sick pay arrangements in place, but where this is not the case and employees have an income need to cover the short period until illness benefit becomes available, they can claim supplementary welfare allowance.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.</p>  <p>The current provisions, which apply to someone claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from a date after their 65 birthday, is that they may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  While this is currently up to their 66 birthday, this approach will continue to extend their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit entitlement continuing for another year when the pension age rises to 67, and indeed a further year when it rises to 68 in 2028.  This eligibility is of course still subject to satisfying conditions such as the &lsquo;genuinely seeking work&rsquo; condition.</p>  <p>  From January 2014 jobseeker activation criteria were eased for people aged 62 and over.  They are still able to avail voluntarily of an array of supports, which are available from this Department if they wish to return to work, training or education.  However, sanctions will not be applied to this cohort, should they decide they do not wish to engage with the activation process.</p>  <p>  Special arrangements have also been made so that the majority of older people in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment will have to register with their local office only once a year and their payments will be paid directly into their bank accounts.  These provisions have enabled these individuals to ease their transition into one of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes until they become eligible for a State pension on their 66th birthday.</p></reply>

However, it is important to note that company employees, contractors and the self-employed who identify themselves as working in the construction sector may avail of a range of vehicles for retirement provision such as occupational pension schemes including small self-administered pension schemes or personal pensions such as PRSAs or Retirement Annuity Contracts and membership numbers would not be included in these CWPS figures.</p>  <p>  In January 2015 a cross departmental Universal Retirement Savings Group was established to develop a roadmap and timeline for the introduction of a new, universal, supplementary workplace retirement saving scheme.  Such an employment based defined contribution scheme would increase coverage across all employment sectors including construction and will have particular focus on lower-paid workers.</p></reply>

Employees pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4% and are covered for a range of benefits and pensions, including the State pension (contributory).  In addition, their employers generally make a PRSI contribution of 10.75%, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.</p>  <p>  To establish entitlement to State pension (contributory), a contributor must, in the first instance, have paid at least 520 qualifying contributions by the time they reach pensionable age, currently 66 years.  Once this condition is satisfied, a full or reduced weekly rate of pension is payable depending on the yearly average number of contributions paid over the period from commencement of employment/self-employment up to pension age (66).</p>  <p>  The qualifying conditions for entitlement to State pension (contributory) apply to all classes of contributors and there is no differentiation in treatment for State pension (contributory) purposes between the self-employed and employees.  In addition, it should be noted that the self-employed are awarded 52 contributions each year regardless of the number of weeks in which the self-employment was carried out in that year while employees are awarded contributions only in respect of the number of weeks worked.</p>  <p>  Employees and the self-employed who reach 66 years and who do not satisfy the conditions for entitlement to the State pension (contributory) are eligible to apply for the means-tested State pension (non-contributory).</p></reply>

It provides financial support to community companies that provide revenue generating services of a social inclusion nature.  A core requirement of the programme is that service providers generate non‐public revenue from their operations by charging fees for services delivered or by way of fundraising.  Companies in contract with the programme must be not‐for‐profit, social enterprise or community business in nature.  The services provided are wide ranging and include facilities and activities for older people and those with disabilities, rural transport, community media, childcare, leisure facilities, home insulation and environmental projects.  The programme is funded by the Department with day-to-day management of contracts undertaken by Pobal.</p>  <p>  The company referred to by the Deputy had a contract from 01/01/2011 until 31/12/2013 under the CSP.  Since then this contract has been subject to a number of reviews, extensions and appeals.  In December 2015, the company were advised that the grant agreement under the CSP would not be extended beyond 31/03/2016.  The reason for this decision is due to the sustainability, financial viability and poor value for money issues that were identified not being addressed.  As a result, the company are due to exit the CSP at the end of March 2016. However, it has been agreed that this date will be extended by a further two months to enable the company to plan appropriately to exit the programme.</p></reply>

The first point of contact for homeless clients to access this service is their local community welfare service.</p><p>The Rent Supplement Unit for Mid-Leinster has a number of Rent Supplement Designated Officers who deal with the issue of threatened homelessness and they liaise with homeless agencies and homeless representatives to provide immediate support by way of the Rent Supplement scheme to prevent homelessness.</p><p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 59,000 people for which the Government has provided a budget of approximately &euro;267 million for 2016.  There were over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015 and over 2,000 rent supplement tenancies awarded during the first two months of 2016.</p><p>The Department introduced a <i>Divisional Framework on preventing Tenancy Loss for Rent Supplement Recipients</i>in January 2015 to ensure consistency in dealing with Rent Supplement recipients who are at risk of homelessness or tenancy where rents are increased in excess of prescribed limits.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and Rent Supplement is paid at rates above the prescribed maximum rent limits where homelessness or the threat of homelessness is a factor.  This flexible approach has assisted over 7,100 households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent payments, with over 750 households assisted in Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  A detailed breakdown for the relevant Counties is provided.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support scheme.  In July 2013, the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, the responsibility for the provision of rent support to those with long-term housing needs transferred from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to Local Authorities.  This applies both to existing customers on the Rent Supplement scheme and also to new customers who have been assessed by the Local Authority as having a housing need.  Officials in the Department of Social Protection continue to engage with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Local Authorities, including Kildare and Meath, to support the on-going transfer of persons with long term housing needs to HAP.  There are now over 7,700 persons in receipt of HAP of which over 200 are in the Kildare and Meath areas.  Support is also available to assist persons under the Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) scheme towards rent deposits or rent in advance for both rent supplement and HAP recipients.  In 2015, DSP made a total of some 2,500 rent deposit payments at a cost of &euro;1.4 million.</p><p>Persons in danger of becoming homeless should make immediate contact with the Community Welfare Service of the Department of Social Protection or the Threshold Tenancy Sustainment Service.</p><p><b>Total Increased Rental Payments by County as at 21/03/2016</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>326</td><td></td><td>326</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>283</td><td></td><td>283</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>146</td><td></td><td>146</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The key performance indicators against which JobPath will be measured are:</p><p>- the number of JobPath clients moving into employment (objective: more people getting jobs);</p><p>- the duration of sustained periods of employment (objective: fewer people moving back onto the Live Register);</p><p>- the average duration of unemployment for JobPath clients (objective: reduction in duration as measured by time in receipt of a jobseeker related income support payment); and</p><p>- the level of JobPath client satisfaction as part of the public employment service (objective: achieve a high level of JobPath client satisfaction).</p><p>The roll-out of JobPath is not yet completed. It is expected to be finalised towards mid-year.  Given that clients will spend 52 weeks on JobPath it is necessary to allow sufficient time to elapse before a meaningful assessment can be carried out.  At the present time it is too early to undertake an evaluation of performance.  As indicated in &ldquo;Pathways to Work 2016 &ndash; 2020&rdquo; the Department intends to publish JobPath performance statistics from Q3 2016.</p></reply>

The 2016 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.8 billion.</p>  <p>  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four days in any period of seven consecutive days.  A person working four or more days a week will not qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, even if they work only a small number of hours on those days.</p>  <p>  All jobseeker customers can take up to two weeks' paid holiday days per calendar year, that is, for any period (consecutive or non-consecutive) of 12 days.  Jobseekers are entitled to payment in respect of their claim (including dependants where applicable) for the holiday period without being subject to the normal conditions of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The jobseeker schemes are paid weekly in arrears with the customer certifying that they did satisfy the conditions of the scheme.  Where a customer avails of the holiday option, payment continues to be in arrears, with the customer presenting to their Intreo Centre on return from holidays to have their payment for the holiday period issued.</p>  <p>  There is no situation where a claimant can be automatically classified as a casual worker.

Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.  In addition, I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that, as part of their on-going supervision, the Central Bank, working in conjunction with the European Cental Bank (ECB) as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), continues to challenge the banks on their strategies, management, measurement and reporting of the resolution and restructuring of all non-performing loans (NPLs) including SME NPLs.  Relevant actions taken by the Central Bank in recent years have been extensive and include, inter alia, capital assessment reviews, stress tests, distressed credit operation reviews, balance sheet assessment exercises, SME loan resolution bank specific targets, on-site inspections and on-going, intensive supervisory engagement with the banks regarding distressed debt. In 2013 non-public institution specific SME distressed loan resolution targets were set for a number of banks.  The targets required the banks to develop strategies, at borrower level, to resolve their non-performing loans.  The targets ended in Q1 2015 with lenders reporting that they satisfied the requirements set out.  Progress has been made by the relevant institutions in resolving SME NPLs in recent years and NPL trends continue to move in a positive trajectory.  Bank of Ireland have indicated that they have reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases and more than 9 out of 10 restructured business banking borrowers continue to meet their agreed arrangements. AIB has also made significant progress in reducing distressed loan balances with the process of restructuring the group's SME book reaching its latter stages with the majority of offered SME restructures either complete or at the final stages of completion.  Recognising these developments, alongside changes in the supervision of the banks following the introduction of the SSM, the Central Bank's approach to commercial NPL resolution utilises a bank specific approach taking into consideration a number of factors including, inter alia, the institution's NPL resolution strategy and operational capability.  The sustainable resolution of distressed SME loans remains a significant priority for the Central Bank and will therefore continue to be central to their supervisory focus throughout 2016 and beyond.  Supervision will continue to be intrusive, supplemented by targeted inspections and enhanced monitoring of performance of the banks in delivery of supervisory objectives.</p></reply>

Since 1 January 2016 there is no stamp duty charge for debit card transactions.</p>  <p>  In addition, I made changes to interchange fees faced by retailers accepting cards.  I announced that an EU regulation would halve the interchange fee charged to retailers to 30 basis points for credit cards and that I was halving the corresponding fee for domestic consumer debit cards to 10 basis points.  These changes came into effect on 9 December last year and significantly reduce the costs of accepting card payments.  Combined, these reductions will save retailers an estimated &euro;36 million a year in fees.</p>  <p>  These interchange fees form part of the overall charges collected by acquirers from retailers.  An acquirer is a financial services company (e.g. a bank, bank subsidiary or payment institution) which manages the account and relationship between a retailer and the various card schemes.  All acquirers in Ireland are independent commercial entities and I have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by acquirers, other than setting caps on interchange fees as I have done.</p>  <p>  Many retailers, particularly smaller retailers, could stand to benefit from shopping around for lower rates from acquirers for accepting cards.  The changes announced in the Budget speech present an opportunity for retailers to examine the rates they are paying so as to ensure they are getting the best rates.</p></reply>

These are costs which homeowners in other households have to fund themselves for their own properties, for which they do not receive tax relief. Similarly, owner-occupiers in managed estates cannot claim tax relief for management fees.  Such properties would have been purchased by their owners in the knowledge that they would be taking on commitments to partake in, and to fund, the management of the estate.</p><p>With regard to rental properties, the Deputy will be aware that landlords are liable to tax on their net rental profit after deduction of allowable letting expenses.

The provision was inserted by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No 2) Act, 2014.  While policy responsibility rests with the Minister for Social Protection, the legislative provision makes the payments a charge on the Central Fund i.e. they are not a charge on the Vote for the Department of Social Protection. Payments made directly from the Central Fund are the responsibility of the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  In order to make a payment from the Central Fund, the Minister for Finance has, firstly, to requisition a credit from the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Comptroller and Auditor General Amendment Act, 1993.  Under that Act, the Comptroller and Auditor General has to satisfy himself that the credits sought "comply in all other respects with the provisions of the enactments relating to them."  In this case, the relevant enactment is the amended Pensions Act.  That Act provides that the Minister for Finance may pay moneys for the purpose of the discharge "of the liabilities of an eligible pension scheme".</p>  <p>  My Department was approached by the Department of Social Protection in relation to payments from the Central Fund to former employees of Waterford Crystal in respect of service given under contract, which had not been purchased at the point of insolvency of the company.  Before it proceeded to requisition a credit from the Comptroller and Auditor General for the payments, my Department asked the Department of Social Protection to clarify whether the unpurchased service was a liability of the pension scheme at the point of insolvency.  The latter Department has now obtained legal advice, which confirms that unpurchased service at the date of winding up of the Waterford Crystal Pension Fund cannot form part of the liabilities of the pension scheme for the purposes of section 48B of the Pensions Act.</p></reply>

These reports cover each full year of NAMA's operations and provide a breakdown of disposals by sector and location, as well as the number of residential units disposed of by its debtors and receivers.</p>  <p>  In the same way as banks or other financial institutions do not publish lists of properties owned by people who have borrowed money from them, NAMA does not do so.

The programme raised matters which relate to individuals at the margins of the buyer side of the Project Eagle loan sale and which fall within the jurisdiction of the Northern Ireland authorities.  These matters have been raised previously on a number of occasions, in the Oireachtas and elsewhere.  I understand that there are a number of investigations underway in this regard, including those with the UK National Crime Agency (NCA), the US Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Law Society.  I welcome these investigations as such serious allegations should be, and clearly are being, thoroughly investigated.  However, I reiterate that, to the best of my knowledge, these investigations concern activities on the purchaser side of the sales process and do not involve NAMA's role in this process.</p>  <p>  NAMA has publically stated the factual position on the sale of its Northern Ireland loan portfolio through its appearances before the D&aacute;il Public Accounts Committee (16 December, 1 October 2015) and the Oireachtas Finance Committee (16 December 2015) and, separately, in detailed submissions to the Northern Ireland Finance and Personnel Committee (4 September, 27 November 2015), who recently published their own report on the sales process.  All of this information is on public record and available from NAMA's website, the Oireachtas website, and the Northern Ireland Finance and Personnel Committee's website. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General ("C&amp;AG") has commenced work on a second report under Section 226 of the NAMA Act, which will focus on the progress NAMA has made at the end of 2015 towards achieving its overall objectives.  I understand that the C&amp;AG has, in parallel with the Section 226 review, commenced work under Section 9 of the C&amp;AG (Amendment) Act 1993 ("1993 Act") of an examination of the disposal of the loans of Northern Ireland debtors.  The C&amp;AG has indicated that he may issue a report, under Section 11 of the 1993 Act, if he considers that it is warranted by the findings of the Section 9 review.  This is consistent with the C&amp;AG's power to investigate, scrutinise and report on concerns regarding any aspect of NAMA's work which may arise through its annual audits or special reports about any aspect of NAMA's work.</p>  <p>  In the absence of any allegation or evidence of wrongdoing by NAMA, the C&amp;AG is best positioned to independently review this transaction. C&amp;AG officials have confirmed that, given their independent role, any queries related to the timing, content, or any other specific aspects of their reports should be directed to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I would encourage the Deputy to support this process and await the findings of the C&amp;AG's independent review.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which come into operation on 1 July 2016.</p>  <p>  Landlord-tenant relations are governed by multiple pieces of legislation (mainly under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government) and the landlord/owner of the property is restricted in what they can do in relation to removal of tenants from a property.  I understand that these restrictions are the same whether the landlord bought the property, built the property themselves, became a landlord as a result of renting out what was formerly a principal dwelling house or acquired the property by other means such as enforcing loans secured on the property.</p></reply>

Capital gains tax (CGT) is charged at a rate of 33% on gains realised or deemed to be realised (in the case of gifts) on the disposal of assets in excess of  an annual tax-free gain of &euro;1,270.  In addition, disposals by qualifying individuals of qualifying business assets are charged at a reduced rate of 20% up to a lifetime limit of chargeable gains of &euro;1 million.</p>  <p>  It has never been a feature of the CGT code to charge different rates depending on the value of the asset being disposed of.  That said, in common with all taxes CGT is subject to ongoing review, in which the rate of tax and all reliefs and exemptions are carefully considered.  Decisions concerning changes to taxes, generally, are taken in the course of the Budgetary and Finance Bill process and I will bear the Deputy's suggestion in mind in that context, subject to my continuing in my role as Finance Minister following the formation of the next Government.</p></reply>

Construction services already avail of the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% while most economic activity is subject to the standard VAT rate of 23%.  Ireland has historically applied the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to all construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive.  This derogation is only permissible where the VAT rate applying is 12% or greater.  Accordingly, it is not legally possible to introduce a 9% rate of VAT on non-residential construction services.  Having said that, it is possible to apply the 9% VAT rate to the construction of residential properties, but as I have said before this would involve having two separate VAT rates applying to construction services, would be difficult to administer and could lead to underpayment of VAT.

There are also a number of other allowances and deductions available to reduce the tax on rental income paid.  These include, for example, the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant and the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has published a guide to the income tax treatment of rental income.  It sets out the amount of rental income to be taken account of for income tax purposes and provides a comprehensive list of expenditure items that are allowable for deduction in computing rental income for tax purposes.  This guide is available at:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that in Finance Act 2015, I introduced a new relief which will allow a full 100% mortgage interest deduction where a landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to tenants in receipt of social housing supports and registers such undertakings with the Private Residential Tenancies Board within certain time limits.  Further information on this relief is available in section 97 of the Revenue Commissioners Notes for Guidance Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 Finance Act 2015 Edition Part 4 Principal Provisions Relating to the Schedule D charge, which is available at <i>.</i></p><p>The taxation of all rental property in the State is dealt with under the same legislation, and an attempt to carve out a cohort of 'accidental' landlords would prove problematic.  There are many reasons why individuals might choose, or feel obliged, to rent a property while putting their own mortgaged property out to rent, such as relocation for work purposes or changed family circumstances, and all are treated equally by the tax system.  The provision of additional tax deductions to one sub-set of landlords could create difficulties in the rental marketplace as a result of the advantage obtained over other landlords of similar residential property.</p><p>I am conscious of the challenges that individuals continue to face, despite the improving economic conditions.  However I would also note that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and or USC in 2014 saw a reduction in their tax bill in 2015 where incomes were equal. Budget 2016 continued this process of reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of USC with effect from January 2016.</p></reply>

Under section 216A, sums arising to an individual in respect of the letting of a room or rooms as residential accommodation in his or her home and from meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting are exempt from income tax, USC and PRSI where they are below the annual limit for the tax year in question (&euro;12,000 for 2015 and 2016) and certain other conditions are satisfied.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the relief is to increase the supply of affordable rental residential accommodation by incentivising homeowners to rent out a room or rooms in their principal private residence to individuals. It applies where an individual is effectively using the room either on its own or in conjunction with other parts of the residence, as his or her home. The relief is not, and never was, intended to apply to income arising from the provision of guest accommodation to occasional visitors.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that profits arising from the provision by individuals of guest accommodation in their home are subject to tax, irrespective of whether such accommodation is provided in the manner described in the details supplied or through more traditional forms of service provision, such as a guest house or B&amp;B. Where accommodation is provided on an occasional basis, as distinct from in the course of a guesthouse or B&amp;B trade, the income arising is treated as miscellaneous income and expenses incurred directly in the provision of the accommodation, for example the cost of providing meals, light, heat or laundering costs, would be allowed to be deducted in computing the homeowner's taxable profits from that activity. A homeowner who is carrying on a trade of guest accommodation can avail of the normal trading deductions in computing his or her taxable profits.</p>  <p>  Regardless, however, of whether guest accommodation is provided on an occasional basis or in the course of a trade, and whether it occurs in the manner described in the details supplied or through more traditional forms of service provision, any profits arising from such activity are chargeable to income tax, universal social charge and PRSI in the normal manner. In addition, there is no provision in the TCA 1997 which exempts such profits from income tax below an income limit.</p></reply>

He noted that tools such as mortgage macro prudential rules and the recently introduced system of counter-cyclical capital buffers would have mitigated the costs of the boom-bust credit cycle in Ireland in the mid-2000s and that the Irish economy remains vulnerable to adverse shocks, with limits to household leverage offering protection to households and banks.</p></reply>

Having considered the report, I decided to take no action in relation to the VAT burden on charities at this time.  </p>  <p>  Mountain rescue services are treated in a similar manner to charities in that they are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive. This means that they do not register for VAT and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. This non-entitlement to VAT deductibility is a general feature of VAT exemption. Introducing a VAT refund scheme for an exempt organisation such as mountain rescue services would lead to similar claims from other VAT exempt organisations including charities and sporting organisations. Requests for new Ministerial Refund Orders have been consistently refused since the 1980s primarily to maintain the integrity of the VAT system and I will not be introducing a targeted compensation scheme for mountain rescue services at this time.</p></reply>

Ireland's corporate tax rate of 12.5% on trading income is akin to a brand and is an important part of the Government's strategy of creating an enterprise friendly environment to attract jobs and investment to Ireland. One of the main features of the rate is its simplicity and the fact that it applies to a broad base. </p>  <p>  The Deputy's suggested approach would involve complexity and could undermine the attractiveness of Ireland's corporate tax offering.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to predict the effect such a levy would have on the behaviour and decisions of companies within the State.

Broadly speaking, a close company is a company under the control of 5 or fewer participators (including their associates), or of participators who are directors. The vast majority of companies registered for corporation tax in Ireland are "close companies".   </p>  <p>  There are specific rules in Irish tax law that are applicable to close companies. These rules are designed to ensure that persons who conduct certain activities and transactions through corporate structures do not receive an unfair tax advantage over persons who conduct similar activities and transactions without incorporating. The close company surcharge applies in respect of investment income earned by a company, such as interest, dividend or rental income, which is not distributed to the company shareholders within 18 months of the company's year-end. The surcharge does not apply to the retained trading income of a close company. With investment and rental income of a company subject to tax at a 25% rate, there would be a strong incentive in the absence of a surcharge for persons to accumulate and retain such income within a company and thereby avoid marginal rate income tax and USC.   </p>  <p>  With regard to professional services companies (i.e. those that are engaged in professional services) that are close companies, the surcharge is extended to include a surcharge of 15% on one half of any trading profits which are not distributed within 18 months of the end of the accounting period. The activities of professional service companies are those that are typically carried on by an individual or partnership such as, for example an accountant, solicitor, engineer, doctor etc. The service company surcharge was introduced in order to counteract an abuse whereby these activities were diverted to a company, being a company controlled by individuals who are actually providing the relevant services, and the income is withheld from distribution and therefore not subjected to income tax. As the surcharge only applies to 50% of undistributed trading income, provision is made for retention and re-investment of profits within professional services companies.   </p>  <p>  In order to assist small businesses, in Finance Act 2013, I increased the minimum threshold of undistributed income from &euro;635 to &euro;2,000, thus enabling small businesses to retain a higher amount of income for reinvestment without being liable to a surcharge.</p>  <p>  In relation to tax credits available to self-employed individuals, as the Deputy is aware, I introduced the Earned Income Credit to the value of &euro;550 in Budget 2016. This has been in operation since January this year and is available to those with earned income who do not have access to the PAYE credit, benefitting small business-owners right across the country.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I stated in my Budget speech that I viewed the introduction of this credit as a first step in addressing disparities in the tax treatment of entrepreneurs. However, it should also be noted that there are aspects to the tax treatment of the self-employed which can be beneficial to them. For instance, there are significant timing benefits relating to the payment of tax which, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, are available to the self-employed but not available to PAYE workers. In addition, the expenses regime for self-employed taxpayers remains more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.    </p>  <p>  Any analysis of the tax treatment of the self-employed would need to take into account potential benefits of the tax treatment as well as potential costs. However, I would point out that the future direction of tax policy in this area will be primarily a matter for the incoming Government.</p></reply>

Decisions taken by the banks are a matter for the board and management of the relevant institution. The Relationship Framework Agreements define the 'arm's length' nature of the relationship between the State and the banks in which the State has an investment. </p><p>The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. </p><p>Last May, I requested a report from the Central Bank on the topic which was subsequently published. The Report on the Influences of Standard Variable Rate Mortgage Pricing is available <i>here:   </i>. It stated that the spread between official ECB interest rates and the standard variable mortgage rate is relatively high in Ireland, both by historical standards and compared to European peers. However, three factors are important determinants of this margin, namely increased credit risk resulting from high levels of non-performing loans and lengthy and uncertain processes of collateral recovery, weak competition, and the constraints on bank profitability arising from legacy issues of the financial crisis, such as an increased regulatory requirement for capital.</p><p>Nonetheless, I have taken steps to ensure that the banks provide options for mortgage holders to reduce their monthly repayments. I met with the six main mortgage lenders in May and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high. The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.  </p><p>In September I concluded a series of follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that the majority have put options in place to allow many borrowers reduce their repayments. These options range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan-to-value and reductions in fixed rates. I therefore encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their circumstances or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory. In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website <i>www.consumerhelp.ie </i>is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions. In addition, the CCPC are currently running a mortgage switching campaign and have a mortgage switching tool on their website which should allow borrowers compare rates charged across institutions.  I also note that some lenders offer repayment of legal fees or cash incentives to borrowers switching mortgage provider.</p><p>I asked the banks to provide options by which borrowers could reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place.</p></reply>

This announcement was separate to the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA), which relates to the terms and conditions of serving public servants. </p>  <p>  These PSPR ameliorative proposals have since been legislated for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) 2015 Act, with changes occurring in three stages, on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2016, increases in the annual pension thresholds before PSPR applies were activated. These exemption threshold increases remove PSPR entirely from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR receive a boost of &euro;400 per year.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, will fully remove PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR by &euro;500 per year. </p>  <p>  On 1 January 2018, the third stage of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will not longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.</p>  <p>  These PSPR changes under FEMPI 2015 deliver on my commitment to restore the pensions of retired public servants as early as economic and fiscal progress allowed, with an initial focus on those receiving relatively lower pensions. This pension restoration will cost an estimated &euro;90 million on an annual basis and, when fully implemented, will ensure that only the top 20% higher value public service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR.</p></reply>

The event of 2014 was an extreme one and exceeded the design capacity of this channel. </p>  <p>  The OPW recently approved funding for a study of the White River in Dunleer, from an application received from Louth County Council under this Office&rsquo;s Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  I understand that Louth County Council has recently appointed a consultant to carry out this study.  The impact of any obstructions on the flood risk will be determined by the study and appropriate remedial action identified.</p>  <p>  Each year the OPW carries out work to approximately 2,000km of channels and about 200 structures around the country, as part of its ongoing and rolling arterial drainage maintenance programme.  The OPW did carry out tree pruning on the White River in Dunleer through the town during 2015.</p></reply>

The CIP is the basis for access to extended sick leave which provides substantial additional protection to individuals experiencing critical illnesses or serious injury.</p>  <p>  Under the CIP, public servants who suffer from a critical illness or serious physical injury may have access to extended sick leave of 6 months on full pay in a rolling 1 year period, followed by 6 months on half pay, subject to a maximum of 12 months' paid sick leave in a rolling 4 year period. This is the same as the access that existed under the previous sick leave schemes in place across much of the public service. </p>  <p>  Under the "protective year", if an individual returns to work following CIP he or she may continue to avail of any remaining extended sick leave for subsequent illness or injury, critical or non-critical, which occur within 12 months of the first date of absence due to the critical illness/injury.</p>  <p>  If sick leave at full pay and half pay is exhausted an individual may access Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR) subject to certain conditions.  Regulation 16 provides that where an individual has received 365 days' paid sick leave in a 4 year rolling period, he or she may be paid TRR for a maximum of 365 days (1 year). </p>  <p>  TRR may be paid for a further period of 730 days (2 years) where it is a direct continuation of an illness under the Critical Illness Protocol, and:</p>  <p>  - a further period of sick leave is required to rehabilitate from the critical illness/injury;</p>  <p>  - an occupational health physician certifies that there is a reasonable prospect of the individual returning to work and giving regular and effective service; and</p>  <p>  - the decision to award the additional period of temporary rehabilitation remuneration is reviewed every 6 months.</p>  <p>  The rate of payment of TRR is determined based on pensionable service. Public servants who pay Class A PRSI may also receive Illness Benefit from the Department of Social Protection in addition to TRR. </p>  <p>  While I have outlined the general provisions of the  Sick Leave Scheme that relate to critical illnesses, it is the individual's circumstances, including their sick leave record and the nature of the illness, that are relevant in determining their access to sick leave.</p></reply>

The basis for the current age limit is contained in Council Directive 2010/18/EU which gives effect to the Parental Leave Framework Agreement negotiated by the European social partners in 2009. The upper age limit was negotiated and agreed by employers and Trade Union representatives at EU level and their agreement was then given force of law by the Directive.</p>  <p>  Employers, including those in the public service, are free to give further flexibility to employees in addition to the statutory minimum.  In this context specific policies relating to Parental Leave in each of the sectors of the Public Service, other than the Civil Service, are dealt with by the appropriate responsible Minister.</p>  <p>  In the Civil Service we increased the maximum age of the child in respect of whom civil servants may take parental leave from eight to thirteen years (Circular 13/2010). This arrangement is part of a suite of flexible working arrangements available in the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  However, the question of raising the maximum age for employees in the private sector is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality in the first instance.</p></reply>

Athlone is one of 66 locations in the Shannon River Basin District and 300 locations nationwide that are being assessed under the Programme the purpose of which is to implement the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  Under the Shannon CFRAM Study, draft predictive flood maps for Athlone have been produced and were the subject of a Public Consultation Day in Athlone on 17th February 2015.  The draft maps will be finalised in 2016 following the conclusion of the national statutory public consultation process on 23rd December, 2015. </p><p>Two Public Consultation Days were held in Athlone on 17th December 2015 and 11th February, 2016 to present and discuss preliminary options to manage the significant flood risks.  Integrated Flood Risk Management Plans, containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified in the Shannon River Basin District, follow the finalisation of the flood mapping and the identification of preliminary flood risk management options.  The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for future State investment in flood defences. </p><p>In addition, the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group which was established to enhance on-going co-operation across all of the State Agencies involved with the River Shannon has conducted an audit of the roles and responsibilities of State Agency organisations and has published its Shannon Flood Risk Work Programme for 2016.  This Work Programme which is available on <i>www.opw.ie</i>sets out actions and activities to manage flood risk for the Shannon catchment.</p><p>The Working Group is examining a process for wider consultation.  The Group is also considering the development of appropriate guidance that will set out more clearly the rights and responsibilities of non-statutory bodies.</p><p>The Office of Public Works operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This administrative Scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and are published on the OPW website, www.opw.ie.  It is not available for repair of damaged infrastructure or for maintenance of existing flood defence or coastal protection assets.  It is open to a County Council pending the finalisation of the CFRAM Programme to submit a funding application under the Scheme.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.</p><p>It is also open to County Councils to carry out flood mitigation works using their own resources.</p></reply>

The North East/North West Action Plan for Jobs, launched on 30 November last, aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs in the counties of Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Louth, Monaghan, and Cavan by 2020. Key targets in service of this overall goal are to achieve an increase of at least 25% in the number of start-ups in the region; a 25% improvement in the survival rate of new businesses; an increase in the number of IDA investments in the region by 30-40% up to 2019; and an increase of 300 to 500 in the numbers of Udaras na Gaeltachta supported jobs in the North West.  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agrifood, manufacturing/engineering and tourism, as well as areas targeted for future growth like digital payments, cleantech and creative services. </p>  <p>  Since the Plan was launched on 30 November last, focus has moved to putting in place a comprehensive implementation structure. A Regional Implementation Committee has been established, composed of key stakeholders in the region who will work in concert with Enterprise Champions - nominated senior private sector representatives - to oversee and monitor progress.  This team will meet twice each year to review progress on the delivery of the Plan&rsquo;s actions.  The first Progress Report on the implementation of the North East/North West Action Plan for Jobs will be completed in Q3 2016.</p>  <p>  Key actions in the plan  to be delivered over the period 2015-2017 include the  delivery by IDA of a new Advanced Building Solution in Sligo; the establishment of a North West Regional Skills Forum to ensure the flow of critical skills to enterprises in the region; collaboration between the Enterprise Agencies, ETBs and Institutes of Technology to develop a marketing proposition around the Insurance and Technical Services cluster in the North West; and a Regional Innovation Forum for the North East/North West region to help support more companies to innovate and engage in R&amp;D.</p>  <p>  All regional Action Plans will be supported by investment of up to &euro;250 million over the next five years, including &euro;150 million for a property investment programme by IDA Ireland. A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be made available over the next five years through three competitive calls to be administered by Enterprise Ireland. These competitive calls are being targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to support job creation across the regions.</p>  <p>Two of these regional competitive calls were launched last year.

As the company and the union(s) have been in negotiations relating to future work practices and have availed of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery, namely the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on these negotiations at this point. </p>  <p>  I should also point out that Enterprise Ireland is in ongoing contact with the company.</p></reply>

As a result, it is not possible to provide specific employment figures for 2016 as requested.In 2015,total employment in IDA Ireland client companies stood at 187,056, making 2015 the most successful year in the Agency&rsquo;s history. Table A provides a breakdown by county of all gains and losses.</p><p>One-in-five private sector jobs in the economy are as a result of IDA Ireland-supported FDI, both directly and indirectly, and represent a vital economic contribution by the multinational sector. The number of new investments secured during 2015 was 213, up from 197 in the previous year.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) also had a record year in 2015, with total employment in Enterprise Ireland-supported companies at 192,223, the highest level in its history. Tables B and C provide a breakdown by county of all gains and losses.</p><p>Almost two thirds of the new jobs created were outside Dublin and all of the regions recorded increases in full-time employment over the period.  Enterprise Ireland attributes this strong, mainly export-led, job creation by Irish businesses to an improving entrepreneurial climate for start-ups, dynamic Irish companies innovating and scaling up in key sectors such as food, financial technology and business process outsourcing and improving international economic conditions. </p><p>The number of IDA Ireland site visits by county from 2011-2015 is provided in Table D. It must be noted that the number of site visits is not a true indication of activity within a county. Approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base.  </p><p><b><i>Note:  The data in the following tables A-C is part of an active time

The economic crisis hit the South East&rsquo;s job numbers badly with the loss of 37,800 jobs from Q1 2007 to Q1 2012.  However, through the focused collaborative approach and a range of reforms delivered in the region, over the period Q1 2012 to Q4 2015 the unemployment rate has fallen from 20.1 to 11.9 per cent, with 205,400 at work, an increase of 24,100 over the period.  The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on a South East Economic Development Strategy (SEEDS), which was launched in September 2013, was a very helpful contribution to identifying possible interventions to assist the economic development of the South East region.</p><p>At the end of 2011, <font color="#2F2F2F">after the announcement of sudden job losses in </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">Talk Talk</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F"> in Waterford, </font>I published the <i>South East Employment Action Plan </i>and established an implementation group of stakeholders in the region for the Action Plan, the South East Forum, which I Chaired.  Through collaboration among all stakeholders, the Forum did succeed in implementing the Action Plan and the key actions and recommendations in the SEEDS report and demonstrated what could be achieved in all regions, as we prepared the eight Regional Action Plan for Jobs in 2015.</p><p>I am particularly pleased that the key recommendations of the Action Plan and SEEDS reports are having a demonstrable impact on the performance and the potential of the South East region.  We have reformed and are seeing the growing impact of the Local Enterprise Office network developed through the close cooperation between EI and the Local Authorities; the new Education and Training Boards in Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford have a fresh mandate, who like the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are now focused on developing a stronger link with their local enterprise base; we have strengthened the Regional Offices of IDA and EI with a new focus in their respective national strategies on regional job growth and the appointment of an IDA regional director in the South East; and the emergence of a stronger policy framework to underpin sectorial opportunities with a strong profile at regional level.  We have also sustained an attractive investment aid regime for the South East region and the establishment of a new Regional Skills Forum in the region by the Department of Education and Skills will ensure a focus on attaining ambitious targets improved educational attainment and skills provision in the region.</p><p>The core objective of the South East Regional Action Plan for Jobs launched in 2015 is to support an ambitious programme of enterprise growth and job creation in region over the medium and longer term, as advocated in the SEEDS report.  The primary objective of the South East is APJ-R is to realise the potential to have a further 10-15 per cent at work in the region by 2020 so as to ensure the unemployment rate is within the 1 per cent of the State average. </p><p>Among the actions in the Action Plan to be delivered over the period 2015-2017 include increasing Start-ups/SMEs by 30%, at least 44 additional IDA supported investments in the region over the coming years, a 20% increase in jobs in exporting companies, in particular in manufacturing, agrifood, businesses services and biopharma/medtech and an 85% increase in agrifood exports over the next 10 years and delivering 300,000 extra tourists and 5,000 associated jobs including developing Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East.  The implementation of South East APJ-R is being led by a collaborative enterprise and public sector Group, chaired by enterprise champion Frank O'Regan, with the active support of the five County CEOs in the region and my Department will work closely with the Group as it progresses the Plan over the coming period.</p></reply>

The University of Limerick was appointed in February 2015, following a competitive tendering process, to carry out a study into the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and their impact on employees.</p>  <p>  The study, published in November, 2015, found that zero hour contracts as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation are not extensively used in Ireland.  It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts, such as regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with &ldquo;If and when&rdquo; hours only or a hybrid of the two.  If and when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work.</p>  <p>  The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made in it are those of UL.  Therefore, it was essential that the various stakeholders who contributed to the study and indeed other interested parties who may not have had an opportunity to engage with UL, were given an opportunity to consider and respond to the report. </p>  <p>  To this end, my Department sought submissions from interested parties by way of a Public Consultation.  A large number of submissions were received by 4 January 2016, the closing date for receipt of such submissions.  The responses contain a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations as made by UL, which require, and are currently being given, careful consideration by my Department.  This will inform the policy response to be considered by Government arising from the study.</p></reply>

The South West Action Plan for Jobs set a target to increase employment in the region by 10-15%, with the potential for up to an additional 40,000 to be employed in 2020.  Good progress was made in relation to job creation in 2015, most notably with the unemployment in the South West Region falling from 10.6% in Q4 2014 to 7.4% in Q4 2015, according to the CSO's latest Quarterly National Household Survey.</p><p>Overall, the CSO is reporting an increase in employment in the South West of 8,300 in 2015, with total employment in the region reaching 283,900, an increase of 3% on the numbers employed at the end of 2014.  Significantly, almost two-thirds or 5,468 of these jobs were in export-oriented businesses supported by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  Employment in Enterprise Ireland firms increased by 1,982 in 2015 to 28,673 and employment in IDA Ireland supported firms increased by over 3,486 to reach a new record high of 33,831. </p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs for the South West Region is about building on the capabilities and strengths of the region, covering counties Cork and Kerry, to develop a more dynamic, internationally competitive and sustainable enterprise economy that can provide well paid jobs and secure sustainable full employment over the long term.  The SW Action Plan includes actions to be taken across a range of Departments and agencies to ensure that all regions of the country can fulfil their enterprise and jobs potential.</p><p>I am pleased that the Implementation Group in the South West is being led by Mr Bob Savage, Managing Director of EMC, includes public and private sector stakeholders from Cork and Kerry.  The Implementation Group met most recently at the end of February to review progress and will report by mid-year on the delivery of actions to date and the progress on strategic initiatives for the region including in the areas of <font color="#2F2F2F">agrifood, tourism, life sciences, manufacturing and ICT, as well as high-potential emerging sectors like multimedia/content and the green economy, energy and marine.  Actions in the Plan to be delivered over the coming period include measures to achieve an increase of 40-50% in the number of businesses starting-up, scaling and surviving, to achieve a 20% increase in employment in exporting companies, delivered by winning 139 IDA investments, building an IDA advance facility in Tralee and a 50% increase in enterprise-research collaborations and other measures to support growth in Irish exporting companies. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Talent and skills development is a key priority for the region and the actions set out are targeted at achieving a doubling in the level of workforce training and development activity in the region, to be delivered in part by progressing the Munster Technological University project and establishing an Employer and Education Skills Forum. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Actions are also set out to increase by 40% agrifood output to 2020 and to achieve a 33% increase in overseas tourist numbers, in addition to developing new sectors, including the content/multimedia sector, innovative energy technology and the green economy and rolling out &ldquo;smart region&rdquo; infrastructure.</font></p></reply>

There are 12 IDA Ireland client companies employing 1,931 people in the county.  70% of all new IDA Ireland jobs come from existing client companies, so it is imperative that we ensure that the local supports are provided to maintain the presence of these companies in Ireland.</p><p>As part of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015, IDA Ireland is set to invest &euro;150 million over five years in property solutions designed to allow it to create opportunities to win additional projects for all regions.  As part of this programme of investment, IDA Ireland is building nine advance facilities around the country, in particular in locations where the private sector has been slow to build.  This includes the delivery of an advance facility in Tralee, Co. Kerry.</p><p>This is a positive development for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into regional locations.  It will provide access to modern property solutions which, when combined with a strong local talent pool and existing FDI cluster, will give these locations an enhanced proposition to offer international investors. </p><p>The tender process is underway for the appointment of a contractor for the construction of the facility in Tralee.  The notification of the decision to grant planning permission was received from Kerry County Council on 25 February 2016 and the contractor will be appointed after the final grant of planning permission is received by IDA Ireland.  The anticipated completion of the building is quarter 1 2017.</p><p>As part of its efforts to market Ireland and its different business locations, IDA Ireland continues to explore marketing opportunities based on the key criteria used by companies to assess different locations.  In relation to County Kerry, IDA Ireland is actively exploring the potential of different digital marketing initiatives.  IDA Ireland is also keen to work in partnership with other stakeholders in the delivery of effective marketing of County Kerry as a location for Foreign Direct Investment.</p><p>Marketing of any regional area, including Kerry, for Foreign Direct Investment is done through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.  While IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland, the ultimate locations selected are always decided<font color="#5F5F5F"> </font>by the companies themselves.  </p><p>The development of indigenous enterprise is crucial for the county.  Enterprise Ireland is very active in Kerry, and continues to focus on the development of its indigenous client base in the county.  It also promotes High Potential Start-Up Companies through a series of initiatives, including the Competitive Feasibility Fund, Competitive Start Fund and the New Frontiers Programme.  Enterprise Ireland has recently announced a new funding stream of approx. &euro;3m for the delivery of New Frontiers Programmes in IT Tralee &amp;amp; CIT over the next 5 years.  This is a continuation of the successful programmes which support an average 9 new start-up companies in IT Tralee and which are housed in the Tom Crean Incubation Centre each year.  This programme has produced a range of successful HPSUs and domestically focussed businesses.</p><p>A further boost to the county is the reinstatement of Regional Aid for Co. Kerry under the new Regional Aid Guidelines (RAG), which came into force on 1 July 2014.  The RAGs enable the State to grant State Aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions.  The funding for this comes from the Exchequer.  This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are now available in Kerry.</p></reply>

These play an important role in supporting participation by people with disabilities in the labour force.</p><p>The supports include the wage subsidy scheme, the EmployAbility (supported employment) programme and the employment support programme.  I am advised that a person with a disability is at all times free to avail of DSP&rsquo;s Intreo service on a voluntary basis and can have a caseworker assist them in accessing a complete range of activation supports for people with disabilities.</p><p>Under the Reasonable Accommodation Fund, the Department of Social Protection also helps employers to take appropriate measures to enable a person with a disability/impairment to have access to employment by providing the grants and schemes such as the Workplace Equipment/Adaptation Grant, the Personal Reader Grant, the Job Interview Interpreter Grant and the Employee Retention Grant. </p><p>Significant changes to Departmental responsibility have occurred in recent years which place key activation, community employment, vocational training, placement services and other supports related to the employment of people with disabilities outside the remit of my Department. </p><p>Employment related policies and strategies, for which I have responsibility, including the Action Plan for Jobs, are designed to be all-inclusive throughout the workforce.  Enterprise support provided by my Department and its agencies is available to all, including persons with disabilities.</p><p>The Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 prohibit discrimination on nine grounds including the ground of disability.  The Acts apply to prospective employees in claiming discrimination in access to employment.

A case may be lodged through the Workplace Relations Commission&rsquo;s website at .  General information relating to employment rights is available on the website and from the Workplace Relations Commission&rsquo;s Information Service at Telephone: 1890 80 80 90.</p><p>In addition to these supports, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities provides for a ten year strategy to ensure that people with disabilities who are able to and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.  The strategy adopts a cross-cutting approach that brings together actions by different Departments and state agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.</p></reply>

Hence there is a requirement on employers seeking non-EEA nationals via the permits system to conduct a Labour Market Needs Test in the manner prescribed in legislation.</p>  <p>  The application in question was refused on 30 October 2015 and the refusal decision was upheld on 12 January 2016 as the specified nature of employment - head chef - was an employment specified in Regulation 26(1) and Schedule 4 of the Employment Permits Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 432 of 2014) for which a General Employment Permit could not be granted.  Employment Permit applications for chefs are solely considered for the preparation of cuisine originating from a State outside the EEA and where the employee is working in establishments other than fast food outlets.  The occupation in question was on the List of Ineligible Categories of Employment for Employment Permits.  In line with Section 12(3) of the Employment Permits Act 2006 (as amended) an employment permit could not be issued.</p>  <p>  In addition, the applicant did not provide evidence that an advertisement relating to the proposed employment had run in a local newspaper or on a jobs website for three days during the 90 days preceding this application, as was required under Regulations 7, 27(1) and 40(1) of the Employment Permits Regulations 2014 (S.I.

No. 432 of 2014).  All advertisements are required to state a description of the employment, the name of the employer, the minimum annual remuneration, the location/s of employment and the hours of work on offer per week.  In particular the advertisement on the Eures/DSP site did not include details of the employment&rsquo;s salary, while the advertisement in the national newspaper did not include details of the employment&rsquo;s hours or salary.  In line with Section 10A(2) of the Employment Permits Act 2006 as amended, an employment permit could not issue.</p></reply>

The number of people working there has led to serious traffic congestion which has caused significant frustration.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s property department has been working over the past year to explore various options to alleviate the traffic congestion at Parkmore.  A suite of infrastructural measures that could be implemented in the short term has also been identified which includes the construction of a new slip road from the IDA Parkmore West Park onto the Parkmore Road.  Following initial discussions with Galway City and County Council, IDA Ireland submitted an application for planning permission to Galway County Council for a left-in left-out junction on 16 February 2016, with a view to proceeding to tender stage for the appointment of a contractor to carry out the works, once permission is granted.</p>  <p>  I have been assured by IDA Ireland that it continues to work to develop long term infrastructural solutions to resolve this issue.  The agency is also a member of the Parkmore Traffic Action Group, which was set up in October 2015 on foot of an urgent meeting with Galway City and County Councils and representatives of companies in the park.  It is heartening to see local stakeholders working together to advance a solution to address the congestion issue.  This is the type of collaborative &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach that is at the heart of the Regional Action Plans.</p>  <p>  I am in regular contact with IDA Ireland in relation to this issue.

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 defines a contract of employment as a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.</p>  <p>  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law.  Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case. </p>  <p>  In relation to public awareness, the WRC Information, Customer Services and Inspectorate functions maintains a high profile as part of the State body primarily responsible for information and compliance on employment rights in a number of ways.  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  To ensure that awareness of these obligations is maintained, the WRC collaborates with key partners including civil society organisations, the trade union movement, employer organisations and other State bodies.  WRC publications are widely distributed through the offices of community organisations, NGOs and Citizen Information Offices.  The WRC also participates in conferences and events and makes presentations not only to employer and employee groups but also to community and educational groups.</p>  <p>  The recent WRC decision does not constitute any change to existing employment law and any persons working under a contract of employment must continue to have the full protection of employment law.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has no plans to review the status of au pairs with a view to deeming persons determined to be employees to be outside the scope of employment law.  The Department&rsquo;s remit in this area is primarily concerned with ensuring that those people found to be employees can enforce their rights, as provided for under employment rights legislation.</p></reply>

The Commission&rsquo;s main function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  The Commission presented its first report to me in July 2015 in which it recommended an increase of 50 cents per hour to the minimum hourly rate bringing it to &euro;9.15.  That increase, which was accepted by Government, came into effect on 1 January last.</p>  <p>  Alongside examining the national minimum wage, the Low Pay Commission can also be tasked with examining matters related generally to the functions of the Commission under the Act.  Given the preponderance of women on the national minimum wage, as identified in the Commission&rsquo;s July report, I asked the Commission to examine this issue and report its views as to the underlying reasons for this position, and to make any recommendations it considers appropriate.  This will allow the development of a better understanding of the composition and profile of this group and any underlying causality.  I welcome the research by the Nevin Economic Research Institute in this area, as it begins to identify some of the issues and concerns, and I have no doubt that the Low Pay Commission will also consider that work in the context of its own research and deliberations.</p>  <p>  I expect the Commission&rsquo;s Report on this matter to be presented by the end of October, 2016.</p></reply>

The University of Limerick was appointed in February 2015, following a competitive tendering process, to carry out a study into the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and their impact on employees.</p>  <p>  The study, published in November, 2015, found that zero hour contracts as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation are not extensively used in Ireland.  The Study noted that &ldquo;the term &lsquo;zero hours contract&rsquo; means someone who is not guaranteed hours of work but who is contractually required to make themselves available for work with an employer.  This is the meaning ascribed by Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  Under the Act, someone with a zero hours contract is entitled to some compensation if they are not required by an employer in a week.</p>  <p>  New Zealand had no legislative definition of Zero Hours Contracts and no similar compensation arrangements in place and Zero hours Contracts were widely used in certain sectors.  As I understand the New Zealand provisions they retain the concept of casual working where these workers do not have certainty of hours, but they can decline work, and the employer is under no obligation to offer work but may not have someone available when needed.  I understand the new provisions require, however, that where hours of work are agreed, they must be clearly specified, such as in collective agreements or the individual&rsquo;s employment agreement, and there is an avenue of redress for employees where there is a failure to record agreed hours in the employment agreement.  This is intended to ensure that employers and employees are clear about their commitments to each other to provide or undertake work, respectively.  I understand that where parties do not set agreed contracted hours, or when employees are offered hours above their agreed contracted hours, employees will be free to decline work on a case-by-case basis or the employment agreement must specify compensation when the employee is required to be available.</p>  <p>  In the Irish context, the UL study found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts, such as regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with &ldquo;If and when&rdquo; hours only or a hybrid of the two.  If and when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work.</p>  <p>  The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues.</p>  <p>  The UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made in it are those of UL.  Therefore, it was essential that the various stakeholders who contributed to the study and indeed other interested parties who may not have had an opportunity to engage with UL, were given an opportunity to consider and respond to the report. </p>  <p>  To this end, my Department sought submissions from interested parties by way of a Public Consultation.  A large number of submissions were received by 4 January 2016, the closing date for receipt of such submissions.  The responses contain a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations as made by UL, which require, and are currently being given, careful consideration by my Department.

This provides a framework to facilitate a fair, transparent and consistent regime for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, between the EU and Canada, and sets out the general conditions for the negotiation of mutual recognition agreements (or MRAs).  Where appropriate, the relevant professional organisations in the EU and Canada can utilise the framework for the negotiation of MRA&rsquo;s for their respective professions.  The recognition of professional qualifications provided by an MRA will allow qualified individuals undertake professional activities in both jurisdictions, in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the MRA.</p>  <p>  The MRA model under CETA involves industry/professions/competent authorities issue joint recommendations, based on CETA guidelines.  This then undergoes assessment by local governments, to ensure compliance with regulatory and legislative requirements, before being rendered binding by the MRA Committee, set up under CETA</p>  <p>  The process of MRA discussions have to date have centred on architects only, and have been following the professional qualifications of standards i.e. education, training and time working in profession.  This will be the first joint recommendation for a MRA to be presented to the CETA MRA Committee.  Currently, the MRA for architects is between the Architects&rsquo; Council of Europe and the Canadian Architectural Licencing Authority (who are the European/Canadian Licensing Authorities respectively), and the local governments.  Both regulatory bodies will need to approve the MRA, as will the MRA Committee established under CETA, but, only when the Agreement is in effect. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the process will follow the same pathway for all other regulated professions, including legal and veterinary services.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.</p>  <p>  Article 45 of the EU Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) specifically highlights &ldquo;the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment.&rdquo;  Ireland has supported this principle of non-discrimination as part of the Freedom of Movement of Workers since our accession to the EEC in 1973.  However, within these legal parameters, the Government has pursued a number of policies aimed at boosting local employment and helping unemployed persons in progressing to work.</p>  <p>  Intreo, under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, provides a single point of contact for all employment and income supports.  Designed to provide a more streamlined approach, Intreo offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers and employers alike.  Intreo provides a wide range of supports and services to assist employers with their employment needs, designed to make sure that employers can access potential employees.  Jobseekers are provided with guidance support and a Personal Progression Plan detailing the individual supports and training and education options and actions towards finding a job.</p>  <p>  JobsPlus is one specific employer incentive which encourages and rewards employers who employ jobseekers on the Live Register.  It is designed to encourage employers and businesses to employ people who have been out of work for long periods.  It provides for a payment of &euro;7,500 for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 12 but less than 24 months  and a payment of &euro;10,000 for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 24 months. </p>  <p>  Since September 2013, a Protocol has been in effect between the Department of Social Protection, my Department and the Enterprise Agencies, with the aim of maximising recruitment by client companies of the enterprise agencies from the Live Register.  This Protocol, implemented in the context of the Pathways to Work strategy, has had the added benefit of enhancing local networks and highlighting employment opportunities in enterprise agency clients in communities throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  In recent months, I have launched eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs aimed at using the strengths of each particular region to grow employment over the next three years.  Targeted supports for local enterprises and local job creation can ensure that employment growth is spread more evenly throughout the country.  These plans are being supported by funding of &euro;250 million over five years to ensure implementation and the establishment of regional frameworks for employment growth.</p>  <p>  Through all of these policies, the Government is working to equip local communities with opportunities to enable the unemployed to find meaningful and sustainable work.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 defines a contract of employment as a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.</p>  <p>  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law.  Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case. </p>  <p>  In relation to public awareness, the WRC Information, Customer Services and Inspectorate functions maintains a high profile as part of the State body primarily responsible for information and compliance on employment rights in a number of ways.  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  To ensure that awareness of these obligations is maintained, the WRC collaborates with key partners including civil society organisations, the trade union movement, employer organisations and other State bodies.  WRC publications are widely distributed through the offices of community organisations, NGOs and Citizen Information Offices.  The WRC also participates in conferences and events and makes presentations not only to employer and employee groups but also to community and educational groups.</p>  <p>  The recent WRC decision does not constitute any change to existing employment law and any persons working under a contract of employment must continue to have the full protection of employment law.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has no plans to review the status of au pairs with a view to deeming persons determined to be employees to be outside the scope of employment law.  The Department&rsquo;s remit in this area is primarily concerned with ensuring that those people found to be employees can enforce their rights, as provided for under employment rights legislation.</p></reply>

In 2015 export volumes increased by approximately 8%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets.  Export values at &euro;570 million, fell marginally by 2% during 2015 due to lower pig prices.  Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices followed by a supply response and/or a recovery in demand.  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and a half and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  This is not an exclusively Irish phenomenon, and Irish prices have actually remained ahead of the EU average for the last five months.  However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices.  This is a function of the market.</p><p><b></b>In relation to the<b></b>Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market.  My Department has met with the Russian authorities on a number of occasions to impress upon them the importance we attach to the normalisation of trade with Russia.  However the restrictions on other products under the EU-wide ban is not something which Ireland alone will resolve and will only be progressed through a common EU approach.  The Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution, and is continuing its efforts to regularise trade between the EU and Russia.</p><p>At last September&rsquo;s Special Meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels, I joined with other like-minded Ministers from other EU member states in calling on the EU Commission to monitor market developments and deliver a comprehensive package of support to address the current difficulties in the Irish and EU pigmeat sector.  The resulting package reflects the majority of the demands presented by Ireland.  An Aids to Private Storage Scheme was established for Pigmeat.  In addition the Commission provided a financial package for pig and dairy farmers, from which &euro;0.5 million in EU funding was provided for Irish pig farmers.  The Government decided to match the EU funding for the sector thus providing for a &euro;1 million package.  A direct aid package payment will issue to all pig farmers<i></i>with a minimum level of supply of 200 pigs slaughtered in 2015 very <i>shortly.  </i>This means a flat rate payment of over &euro;3,000 to each farmer.  This will ensure that the payment is directed to those farmers most affected by the price volatility, thus meeting the requirements of the EU Regulations providing the funding. </p><p>In addition to this measure, following proposals made by Member States, Commissioner Hogan recently proposed a series of measures in response to the crisis in the Agricultural sector.  The EU private storage aid scheme for pigmeat was closed abruptly earlier this year and at last week&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture Ministers I called for its re-opening as soon as possible.  The Commission has agreed to consider re-opening the private storage aid scheme for pigmeat at an appropriate time this year. </p><p>At last week&rsquo;s Council, the Commission also committed to establishing a Meat Market Observatory covering beef and pigmeat.  Furthermore, the Commissioner reiterated his determination to promote the EU&rsquo;s interests and open up new markets for EU products, with a specific &euro;30 million envelope for dairy and pigmeat available under the EU Promotion Scheme to reflect the market disturbances in those sectors.  The Commission will prioritise its engagement with the European Investment bank with a view to developing appropriate financial instruments to assist farmers and processors to invest in their enterprises to improve their competitiveness or to invest in making any necessary structural adjustments.</p><p>At national level, support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways.  Firstly I have included provision in the Rural Development Programme for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors.  Some &euro;35.8 million has been allocated for 2016.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.Other elements of the RDP, such as a targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector.</p><p>Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level.  Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc supports Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The programme which is funded by a voluntary industry levy has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards.  This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat.</p><p>I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets.  Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.</p><p>For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors since the closure of the Russian market in 2014.  In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening last year of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.  My Department will continue in its efforts to develop access to international markets.</p></reply>

The regulation sets out that Member States shall provide for geo-spatial (online) applications, and that 75% of beneficiaries in 2017 and all beneficiaries in 2018 must apply online.  In order to ensure that these regulatory requirements are met, my Department has been moving certain categories of farmers to online application in 2015 and 2016.  This process will continue as we move towards the 2018 regulatory target.</p>  <p>  Within this context, my Department has put in place a rigorous system of support for online applicants via a dedicated helpdesk, and more targeted supports will be in place as the process continues to ensure access to the Basic Payment Scheme is not impeded.  Online application involves a range of advantages for farmers, which will help to ensure the continued efficient and effective delivery of these vital payments.</p></reply>

As similar breaches under the Nitrates Regulations had been identified within the previous three years, the regulatory provisions required that the rules on reoccurrence be applied and also the breach was deemed to be intentional.

Following inspection, it was established that 27 of the horses were not identified in accordance with national and EU legislation.  The equines referred to were seized pursuant to Regulation 26(2) (v) of the European Communities (Identification of Equidae) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 62 of 2016) (as amended), which provides that equines may be seized where an authorised officer had reasonable grounds for believing that an offence was being committed under this legislation.  This legislation also provides that Notices of the seizure and detention of any equines must be issued, providing the owner/keeper of the animals with an opportunity to reclaim the seized animals on production of the required documentation within 5 days.  These procedures were fully complied with by the Department in this case.</p>  <p>  The animals were handled and transported under veterinary supervision and in compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1 2005, Protection of Animals during Transport and Related Operations.  Stallions were separated from the females in the group during Transport.  With regards different sizes of animals, the Regulation provides that animals do not need to be handled and transported separated if they have been raised in compatible groups, are accustomed to each other, and where separation will cause distress.</p>  <p>  I should emphasise that the horse meat issues which were uncovered in 2013 highlighted the importance of the proper identification of equine animals to the protection of the integrity of the food chain.  In this regard, it is essential that equine animals are identified in accordance with legislation in order to ensure that only those animals that are eligible to be slaughtered for human consumption are included in the food chain.  It is also important that all owners fully comply with equine identification legislation so that equines can be traced in the event of an outbreak of disease.</p></reply>

All applications in &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is engaged in a comprehensive programme of gathering the necessary baseline data appropriate to the Conservation Objectives of &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  This is followed by data analysis and the setting of appropriate Conservation Objectives by the NPWS.  Once this process is complete all new, renewal and review aquaculture applications can be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.</p>  <p>  The Appropriate Assessment of Castlemaine Harbour has been completed and the relevant licensing determinations have been made based on applications to hand at the time of the assessment.  The specific application referred by the Deputy was submitted to my Department subsequent to the carrying out of the Appropriate Assessment process for this harbour.  Accordingly, it was not possible to assess this application against the designated Conservation Objectives for the harbour.</p>  <p>  The optimum method for appropriately assessing applications by individual operators, who were not included in the initial overall assessment procedure, is under consideration by my Department.  The process must comply with best scientific practice and be achieved in a manner which will be acceptable to the national authorities and to the EU Commission. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the assessment procedures agreed with the EU Commission require Appropriate Assessments in respect of aquaculture activities to be carried out by the national authorities and unilateral departure from these arrangements is not possible.</p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to expedite the conclusion of this matter as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The unprecedented level of applications to GLAS during 2015 has meant that for GLAS 2, priority was given to what are called Tier 1 and Tier 2 candidates, i.e. those who either manage key environmental assets like endangered birds, protected habitats or high-quality water courses, or who have committed to undertake particularly valuable environmental actions like growing feed-crops for wild birds, adopting low-impact tillage techniques or using low-emission slurry spreading methods. </p>  <p>  Farmers had been urged to present the highest standard environmental plans under GLAS 2, and to adopt actions that would promote them from Tier 3 to a higher tier, thereby significantly increasing the chance of selection. I am delighted that over 80% of applicants in this second tranche of GLAS opted to do so, and with the funding available to me I have been able to approve all of these.</p>  <p>  In addition all GLAS 2 applications from new entrants to farming in 2015, and from new farm partnerships, have been granted priority access under this round, because of difficulties they had in applying under GLAS 1. This includes applications by new entrants or partnerships from Tier 3.</p>  <p>  A third tranche of GLAS (GLAS 3) will open later this year and any applicant who was unsuccessful this time round has the opportunity now to re-examine their proposed farm-plan in consultation with their advisor and see how it might be improved to increase their chance of selection under GLAS 3.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-03-22a.510.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016032200072#WRH03300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181, 182 and 192 together. </p><p>By way of background I should advise the Deputies that concerns have been raised about the lack of a level playing field across the EU in fisheries control and the treatment of vessels from different Member States. To help deal with this situation, a new control framework was introduced by the European Commission. One of the important new tools was introduced under  Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy (the EU Fisheries &ldquo;Control&rdquo; Regulation), which requires Member States to<i>inter alia </i>have in place legal provisions to implement a Points system for serious infringements of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. The number of points to be attributed for specific infringements is fixed at EU level. The EU requirement is that every time a serious infringement is committed, the appropriate number of points will be attributed to the licence holder of the vessel concerned. This EU Points system is applicable to all fishing vessels which fish in the Irish exclusive fisheries zone, whether they are Irish or Foreign flagged. </p><p>Ireland had previously implemented the required EU Points system for serious infringements by fishing vessel licence holders by means of Statutory Instrument No. 3 of 2014 which gave effect to the EU requirement in Irish law. This Statutory instrument was the subject of two recent High Court challenges and was struck down. The two High Court Judgements are subject to appeal. As Ireland is required to have in place a legal instrument implementing the EU Points system a new amended legal instrument was drafted and put in place which took on board, to the extent possible, issues of concern in relation to procedures and process which had been highlighted in the High Court Cases. </p><p>In recent weeks, I was faced with a difficult choice when the Court struck down the previous regulation implementing the EU points system.The approach I chose will, I believe, support the vast majority of law abiding fishermen depending on healthy fish stocks. The alternative would have exposed law abiding Irish fishermen to the serious consequences of illegal overfishing by a small number of Foreign and Irish fishing vessels, thereby threatening the future of our industry. I, accordingly, signed the replacement legal instrument, with amended procedures and processes, (S.I. No. 125 of 2016 - European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2016) on 1 March 2016.</p><p>The new regulation will apply points to Foreign and Irish fishing vessel licence holders who are held  responsible for serious fishery offences such as fishing in protected areas, under-declaring, by a significant amount, the quantities of fish landed, failing to give the required notice of the intention to land to avoid an inspection. </p><p>These types of serious offences are thankfully very uncommon.  From my perspective, my responsibility is to ensure that we have a level playing field for everybody involved in the fishing industry. That means ensuring that the rules are kept.We must implement the sanction of EU points as an effective sanction against that minority in order to protect the majority of our industry.</p><p>The fishing grounds in Ireland&rsquo;s 200 mile fishing zone are some of the most productive in the EU.Fishing fleets of the UK, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and Lithuania, as well as the Irish fishing fleet, are active in these grounds.  Many of the fishing vessels are very large and have the capacity to catch large volumes of fish. Stocks in our zone are always under pressure.  The challenge for Ireland, which has legal responsibility to control all fishing activity in our 200 mile zone,  is to effectively monitor and control the activities of all these fleets under the EU legal framework that applies equally across all these fleets.  If we fail, we will undermine the future of our own fishing industry which is almost totally dependent on these fishing grounds. The EU Points system is an important safeguard for our industry in this regard.  </p><p>In bringing in this new regulation to implement the EU points system replacing the regulation struck down in the Court, I ensured that there were some very significant changes made. Those changes reflected the concerns fishermen had raised about the previous regulation. I sought to strike a balance between Ireland's obligations under EU law and the need to give licence holders a fair hearing.</p><p>In the new regulation, this is done by setting up a new type of Determination Panel and a right to apply to an independent Adjudicator if the licence holder is dissatisfied with a determination of the Panel. Under the previous regulation, the submission of the case by the sea fishery officer established that an infringement had taken place and the SFPA board decided only if it were serious or not. In the revised system the infringement is only alleged until the new Determination Panel consider the evidence and this evidence is provided to the licence holder, who may make a submission to the Determination Panel before the panel consider the matter, thus re-balancing the burden of proof. The new Determination Panel replaces the 3 person panel of the SFPA. The new regulation requires that the panel give reasons for a determination so that a respondent may assess his prospects at an appeal. Finally, under the new regulation the licence holder may appeal on a point of law a decision of the independent fisheries Adjudicator to the High Court.  In the previous regulation, this appeal was &ldquo;final and conclusive&rdquo; &ndash; this aspect of the provision has been removed.</p><p>With regard to proposals that the EU points system should be combined with a successful prosecution through the Courts, on the surface, this appears like a reasonable option and it was examined carefully.  However, this approach does not meet the legal requirements set down by the EU points system.Firstly, in the majority of infringement cases, the Licence Holder is a different person or legal entity to the person on the vessel (the skipper) who commits an offence and who will be prosecuted.  Therefore, there is no connection between the assignment of points to the Licence holder and the prosecution by the Courts of offences under fishery law.  In addition, the EU regulations require that points be assigned from the date of the detection of the 'serious infringement' and will remain on a licence for three years from that date. That requires that the procedures are sufficiently swift to be determined in as short a time as possible.  Fishery prosecutions under the Irish legal system may take some considerable time before they are finally determined and if the EU points are linked to the completion of the prosecution, they would have limited impact as the three year timeframe would be well advanced or indeed may well have expired.</p><p>The position regarding the matter of points assigned under the old regulation is that these points will remain &ldquo;in suspense&rdquo; pending the outcome of an appeal. If the appeal fails, then the points assigned under the old regulation will be abolished.  In any event, they will not be acted upon in advance of the judgement and will not be combined with any new points assigned under the new regulation.The fixed payment notice provision relates to a failure by a licence holder to inform a potential future licence holder of assignment of points which involves a summary offence. The arrangement in place involves the option for a person alleged to have committed the offence relating to a failure to inform a potential future licence holder of assignment of points to make a payment of &euro;200 to avoid prosecution in the court in respect of this offence. The person is not obliged to make the payment and may opt for a Court hearing. This is an option given to a licence holder and was in place in the 2014 regulation and was not subject to challenge in the Courts.</p><p>I plan to bring forward primary legislation to give a sound legal basis to a scheme that implements the EU points system for licence holders. In that context, to provide the necessary consultation, I will commence a Regulatory Impact Analysis on this aspect of the new Bill in the near future.</p><p>Irish fishermen should be assured that the State is taking seriously their concerns that a fishing industry can be maintained for them and those coming after them.  The conservation of this precious and valuable resource is in everyone's interest and is vital for the future of the Irish fishing industry. An effective regulation implementing the EU Points system for Foreign and Irish vessels who commit serious offences fishing in our 200 mile zone is necessary to protect the vast majority of our law abiding industry and to preserve the fishing resources for all Irish fishermen and for future generations.</p></reply>

All applications for sea-fishing boat licences are considered by the Licensing Authority.  As Minister I have responsibility for policy in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing under Section 3 (3) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 2003, as amended by Section 99 of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006.  In this context and as referred to above, Section 3 of the 2003 Act makes provision for Ministerial policy directives to issue to the independent Licensing Authority for Sea-Fishing Boats.  I am, however, precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to individual cases, or a group of cases, with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned under Section 3(5) of the 2003 Act.</p><p>Policy Directive 2/2003 issued in November 2003.  The key overall objective of a new licensing policy at that time was to create a new open and transparent policy which would facilitate the achievement of a sustainable and viable livelihood for fishermen operating in the various types of fisheries taking account of available fishing opportunities and fishing resources.  The Policy Directive has been subject to a number of amendments to deal with new management policies put in place. </p><p>On the basis of a Departmental review of the capacity situation of the fleet, and taking account of intensive consultations with all key stakeholders, including industry representatives and fishermen, the then Minister issued that Directive for adjustment of sea-fishing boat licensing policy.  The Policy Directive addressed some of the critical issues associated with fleet management in the Irish context, including segmentation and replacement capacity policy.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that any amendments to current licensing policy, both in relation to any particular Policy Directive and indeed generally, would have to be carefully considered and analysed.  In this regard, I can inform the Deputy that I have asked Department officials to examine in detail the potential impacts of proposals on fleet policy submitted by a Producer Organisation.  This process will involve <i>inter alia</i>, an evaluation and impact analysis and is likely to take some time.</p><p>Once the analysis is completed, my Department proposes to circulate a paper incorporating these proposals to Producer Organisations for their views. Depending on the views received from the POs, a decision will then be made on whether the matter goes to full consultation with all stakeholders.</p></reply>

The Scheme was designed to provide the necessary proof to customers of Irish dairy products that milk has been produced under both sustainability and quality assurance criteria.  The Scheme gives the dairy sector the capability to both benchmark Irish milk production internationally and to demonstrate the commitment of Irish dairy farms to sustainable farming practices.  The Scheme also allows the sector access to markets and buyers that demand on-farm certification and provide assurance for those customers regarding sustainable production of quality milk.</p>  <p>  The scheme is open to all milk producers with a valid herd registration who supply to milk processors in the Republic of Ireland. Generally such suppliers apply to Bord Bia, through their milk purchaser, for participation in the Scheme. Bord Bia in turn process the application, provide an information pack and then assign the farm to an auditor.  A farm visit will be conducted by an independent auditor on every member&rsquo;s farm at 18-month intervals at a time and day that suits the farmer.  The purpose of these visits is to audit the farm against the quality assurance criteria and to collect data regarding the sustainability of the farm.</p>  <p>  To date almost 14,500 applications to join the scheme have been received, 80% of which have been audited. In total over 60% of all dairy farmers are now certified, meaning they have their audit completed and all the corrective actions have been undertaken.  There are also farms being audited in Northern Ireland and the first certified farm there was approved last month.  This Scheme does not have an end date, as is common with all quality assurance schemes of this nature.  It is a matter for processors as to how to deal with milk from suppliers who may choose not to join the scheme.  To date 80% of suppliers have applied to join the scheme and I understand from Bord Bia that the capacity is there to audit each dairy farm in the country by the end of the year, if required.</p></reply>

This definition applies to all Member States and my Department has no discretion with regard to its implementation in Ireland.  The status of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; introduced under the reformed Common Agricultural Policy is designed specifically to assist young farmers in the initial stages of establishing a farming enterprise.  All farmers who hold low value entitlements including those under 40 years of age will benefit from an increase in the value of their entitlements under the convergence process of the Basic Payment Scheme between 2015 and 2019.  Under the convergence process farmers who hold entitlements with an Initial Unit Value below 90% of the Basic Payment Scheme national average will see the value of their entitlements increase so that all entitlements will have reached at least 60% of the national average of entitlements by 2019. </p>  <p>  With regard to qualification for the enhanced 60% rate of aid under TAMS, the definition of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; laid down for the purposes of any capital investment schemes is also that farmers must be below 40 years of age at the time of application and have been set up in farming within the previous five years.  Unfortunately, this means that some farmers will not qualify for the enhanced rate of aid under TAMS.  However, any young farmers who do not qualify for the enhanced rate of aid under the dedicated Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme will be prioritised for aid under the various other new TAMS schemes which offers grants of 40% of investment costs.  The following schemes are open for application to all farmers irrespective of age:</p>  <p>- Dairy Equipment Scheme</p>  <p>- Low emission Slurry Spreading</p>  <p>- Organic capital investment Scheme</p>  <p>- Animal welfare safety and nutrient storage Scheme</p>  <p>- Pig and poultry investment Scheme</p></reply>

The Commission&rsquo;s own analysis of the worst case scenario would see production levels drop by some 150,000 tonnes, with the producer price for beef falling by as much as 8%.  Ireland, uniquely, exports over 90% of its beef production to the EU, and the entry of a very competitive player such as MERCOSUR would therefore have a potentially damaging impact on our market. It is also important to note that in the case of MERCOSUR, EU and Irish beef would be replaced by beef produced in a less carbon efficient manner.</p>  <p>  I am in regular contact with EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan on this issue.  I have highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s concerns with him both bilaterally and around the table at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in recent months. With my Department I have also been working closely with colleagues in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation - who take the lead in negotiating international trade agreements - and Minister Bruton has raised the matter with Trade Commissioner Cecilia Maelstrom. </p>  <p>  In addition, we have been working with other Member State colleagues in both agriculture and trade formations in order to build effective opposition to any potentially negative developments. As recently as last week, Ireland joined forces with eight other Member States in calling on the Commission to consider very carefully any potential exchange of offers, given the current market situation in the agriculture sector, to update its analysis of the individual and cumulative impacts of MERCOSUR and other negotiations, and to exclude any reference to beef access from any offer under consideration. </p>  <p>  I will continue to keep this issue at the top of the EU agenda.</p></reply>

Trade missions play an important role in this regard, and their use to explore new markets should continue to be optimised so that they facilitate the maximum conversion of new opportunities.  I have completed trade missions to markets as diverse as the U.S., the Gulf region and West Africa in recent times, and I am certain that these missions will continue to play a critical role in 2016 and 2017.  However, while my Department is well advanced in its consideration of likely destinations, having consulted with stakeholders and with the relevant agencies, I think a final decision should await the formation of the new Government and the appointment of a Minister.</p></reply>

The unprecedented level of applications to the Scheme has meant that for GLAS 2, priority is being given to what are called Tier 1 and Tier 2 candidates, i.e. those who either manage key environmental assets like endangered birds, protected habitats or high-quality water courses, or who have committed to undertake particularly valuable environmental actions like growing feed-crops for wild birds, adopting low-impact tillage techniques or using low-emission slurry spreading methods. </p>  <p>  Farmers had been urged to present the highest standard environmental plans under GLAS 2, and to adopt actions that would promote them from Tier 3 to a higher tier, thereby significantly increasing the chance of selection. I am delighted that over 80% of applicants in this second tranche of GLAS opted to do so, and with the funding available to me I have been able to approve all of these. </p>  <p>  In addition all GLAS 2 applications from new entrants to farming in 2015, and from new farm partnerships, have been granted priority access under this round, because of difficulties they had in applying under GLAS 1.  This includes applications by new entrants or partnerships from Tier 3.  All other Tier 3 applications were not selected into the Scheme and the decision letters in respect of these cases have issued to applicants.</p>  <p>  A third tranche of GLAS will open later this year and any applicant who was unsuccessful this time round has the opportunity now to re-examine their proposed farm-plan in consultation with their advisor and see how it might be improved to increase their chance of selection under GLAS 3.</p></reply>

The role of the Irish naval vessel was to provide a search and rescue capability and to undertake humanitarian search and rescue operations at sea in the Mediterranean.  Assistance to persons in distress at sea was provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of international conventions governing search and rescue situations. Co-ordination of search and rescue efforts and the provision of humanitarian assistance were achieved through close co-operation with the relevant Italian authorities.  </p><p>  The success of the operations carried out by L.&Eacute;.

Amongst the specific actions set out in the Strategy is the establishment of an Employer helpline.  The National Disability Authority engaged with the employer umbrella groups to bring this service into being and the new national Employers Disability Information service (EDI)  was launched on 2 February last. The ultimate aim is to promote increased employment of people with disabilities and the service is designed to provide employers with an expert peer source of advice and information on employing staff with disabilities. </p><p>A consortium of Chambers Ireland, IBEC and ISME co-manages this National Employer Support Service which is housed in ISME.  The intention is to build and enhance employer capacity to recruit and retain staff with disabilities by having a pool of authoritative advice and information available.  The service is a centrally-based national resource of peer advice and information for employers on employment of people with disabilities. The service comprises: </p><p>-  A helpline on a dedicated phone line (01- 6762014) providing advice and information to employers on employment of people with disabilities. </p><p>-  A central web-based information resource (CallEdi.ie) incorporating guidance and best practice.  </p><p>-  The use of the mainstream channels of the participating organisations to disseminate information on the service and on matters relating to employment of people with disabilities.  </p><p>-  The development of networks and fora for employers to share experiences and good practice.</p><p>The service provides information and advice on:</p><p>-  Rights and responsibilities under employment and equality law, health and safety law, etc.  </p><p>-  Support schemes from the Department of Social Protection and other supports and tax breaks for employment of people with disabilities;</p><p>-  Practical advice on providing reasonable accommodation;</p><p>-  Inclusive recruitment and workplace practices;</p><p>-  Managing and supporting staff;</p><p>-  Managing acquired disability and return to work;</p><p>-  Trouble-shooting;</p><p>-  Direction to sources of information and advice on specific disability conditions such as hearing loss, vision impairment, autism, specific physical impairments, mental health conditions.</p><p>This initiative will work with and strengthen the disability capacity of mainstream employment support services provided to employer body members.  It is based on the premise that harnessing the goodwill of employers and providing advice and supports as set out above is a better approach and will be more successful in a private sector context than imposing statutory quotas, and no proposals have been prepared to amend the Disability Act as suggested in the Deputy's Question.</p></reply>

The projects are managed on the ground by community based organisations (CBO).</p><p>  The IYJS is familiar with the details of the works required to be carried out at the Moyross premises where a GYDP and a YPPP are operated by the Moyross Development Company (MDC) from five units owned by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The need for the works involved arises from health and safety and fire safety audits completed in the second half of 2014.  The audits highlighted the need for urgent internal fire safety upgrades and a roof upgrade and refurbishment to bring the premises into line with health and safety standards and fire safety regulations and to make it safe and fit for purpose for its users.  The immediate concern was the roof, for which the IYJS authorised the undertaking of substantial repairs in May 2015 with the works involved completed in August.  If these repairs had not been carried out the building would have suffered significant further degradation.</p><p>In May 2015, MDC submitted projected costs for the proposed internal refurbishment works following which approval to proceed to the tender stage was granted by IYJS.In November 2015 MDC informed IYJS that the tendering process had been completed and a preferred supplier identified.  The difficulty that has arisen however, is that the preferred supplier&rsquo;s quote is substantially higher than the costs projected in May 2015 and there are no funds provided for in the Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2016 to meet the costs involved.  In light of this and with a view to exploring all possibilities of funding, the IYJS submitted an application to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in December 2015 for Dormant Accounts funding to meet the cost of the refurbishment works.  Pending receipt of a decision in relation to that application, it is not possible to bring to a conclusion the Department&rsquo;s consideration of the request to proceed with the works. </p><p>It is anticipated that a decision on the IYJS Dormant Accounts application will be made shortly following which the IYJS will be in a position to respond to MDC's request to proceed with the works involved.  In the meantime, the IYJS continues to provide funding of just under &euro;700,000 per annum to the two projects involved on the basis that services continue to be provided to the youth of the area, albeit from different premises in the case of the GYDP.</p></reply>

The table also provides information on the number of persons convicted where a driving licence number was recorded and the number of persons convicted of a penalty point offence where a driving licence number was recorded. I am informed by the Courts Service that, where a driving licence number is recorded and the accused is convicted, the licence number and details of the conviction are forwarded to the appropriate authority.</p><p>While almost 80% of road traffic infringements are dealt with via Fixed Charge Notices (FCNs) without recourse to court, the application of Court-awarded penalty points to driving licences remains a priority for the Criminal Justice Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) Working Group. In this context consideration is now being given by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the establishment of a &lsquo;master driver licence record&rsquo; which will assist by better linking vehicle and driver databases, thereby facilitating the application of penalty points to driving licences.<table><tr><th>Court Area</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>No of Persons Convicted Under

The focus of the Irish resettlement programme in recent years has been on the resettlement of refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict who are living in one of the hosting countries in the region, for example those living in Lebanon, Jordan or Turkey. NGOs working in cooperation with the UNHCR at a local level identify the most vulnerable persons for resettlement, regardless of their race, religion, nationality or ethnicity.</p><p>Resettlement is one of a suite of responses to persons displaced by the Syrian conflict. During 2015, 176 programme refugees were admitted into the State from Jordan and Lebanon of which 163 were part of the Government's pledge to admit 520 refugees as a part of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  A further 88 refugees were admitted from Lebanon in 2016 to date. The balance of the 520 were interviewed during a selection mission to Lebanon earlier this year.  Arrangements for the admission of the remainder of this cohort are ongoing.</p><p>In 2014, Ireland introduced a Syrian Humanitarian Admission Programme (SHAP). The SHAP offered naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth and Syrian nationals already legally resident in Ireland an opportunity to make an application for vulnerable close family members to join them in Ireland for up to two years under a sponsorship programme.  These are persons who are considered by their sponsoring family member present in Ireland to be most at risk.  In addition, Syrians legally resident in Ireland, for example, students or persons on work permissions may apply for an extension of their permission to remain in the State while the crisis situation continues. This Programme is an additional initiative in response to the crisis in Syria and is without prejudice to other avenues whereby by Syrian national might lawfully enter the State, such as family reunification for the family members of refugees and persons with subsidiary protection, and UNHCR's resettlement programme. It should be noted that 44 applications in respect of 119 persons were approved under the SHAP.</p><p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was approved by Government Decision on 10 September 2015, in response to the migration crisis in Southern Europe.  The Government has confirmed that Ireland would take in up to 4,000 persons by the end of 2017, in respect of relocation and resettlement refugees.  This figure of 4,000 includes approximately 2,600 asylum seekers to be taken in from migration hot spots.  To date, ten people have arrived in the State under the EU relocation programme.  This single Syrian family were relocated from Greece at the end of January.</p><p>Under the national asylum procedure, the vast majority of Syrians who have applied for asylum in Ireland since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria in 2011 and whose applications have since been determined, have been declared to be refugees.<b></b>A total of 107 Syrians have been granted refugee status or subsidiary protection in Ireland since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria in 2011. These are applicants who were granted status having made applications for protection either within Ireland or at the frontiers of the State.</p><p>The Deputy will also appreciate that the EU is dealing with a rapidly changing political landscape with regard to the migration crisis in Southern Europe and the situation is likely to remain fluid for a period.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. As with all other Divisions, the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of the Garda Reserve in the Meath Division is considered as part of a distribution model that takes into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the Division in question.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Meath Garda Division as of 31 January 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 277. The Division is also supported by 33 Garda Reserves and 25 civilians. The number of Garda&iacute; assigned to Ashbourne and Duleek on the 31 January 2016, was 44 and 4 respectively.<font color="#000080"> </font>I have also been informed by the Garda Commissioner that Donore is patrolled by members attached to the neighbouring Drogheda District, which is approximately 6 km away.</p><p>Ongoing seamless recruitment to renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is crucial to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective and visible policing throughout the country. With this in mind Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; this year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; who will have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. To date there have been six intakes of Garda Trainees to the Garda College, giving a total intake of 550 with a further 150 commencing training on 11 April 2016.  So far 395 of these new recruits have been fully attested and are undertaking Garda duties in communities nationwide. I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and in this context 15 Probationer Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Meath Division.</p></reply>

The objective of the review was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation's resource base would best meet public demand.</p><p>This was reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Policing Plans 2012 and 2013 which set out the details of the closure of 39 Garda stations in 2012 and 100 Garda stations in 2013.</p><p>The revised structures continue to provide policing support through the restructuring of the station network.  The centralisation of services facilitates the introduction of enhanced patrolling systems that are operational and intelligence led.  This patrol system ensures that a high visibility and community-oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country and that yields the following benefits:</p><p>- Increased Garda visibility and patrol hours</p><p>- Increased mobility and flexibility within an area resulting in an improved policing service to the public</p><p>- Enhanced co-ordination of Garda activity resulting in a greater visibility and presence in the communities</p><p>- More effective use of limited resources across a wider area</p><p>- Continued Garda presence in communities.</p><p>I understand from discussions with the Garda Commissioner that the current consolidation process is largely completed.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also appreciate that the allocation of Garda resources to particular areas is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the first instance.</p><p>The Government has developed a carefully considered strategy to tackle crime, in particular domestic burglary, which has strengthened the law and provided very significant investments to augment the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the law effectively.</p><p>I made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support the concerted drive against crime which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor.</p><p>While it will take some time to properly assess its impact on crime, the Garda authorities have reported very positive operational feedback since the launch of Operation Thor on 2 November 2015. This is underlined by a significant series of arrests in various locations around the country and charges being brought against numerous individuals. Operation Thor has led to the arrest of particular target suspects in relation to burglary, as well as handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences, and including arrests connected to crimes committed by mobile criminal groups. There has been concentrated nationwide Garda activity under Operation Thor, including 16,339 anti-crime patrols,19,851 targeted checkpoints and 1,069 burglary related arrests. The early indications from the Garda authorities are that, in the period from 2 November 2015 to 5 March 2016 Operation Thor has led to an estimated decrease in burglary of in the order of 35% when compared to the same period the previous year. The Garda crime figures will of course be subject to further analysis and verification by the Central Statistics Office in due course.</p><p>Operation Thor delivers on increased investment in policing by this Government and marks a significant step-up in the Garda response to burglaries and related crime.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being specifically committed to support Operation Thor and includes funding for Garda overtime which will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures. Furthermore, since 2012, an overall amount of &euro;34 million has been invested in the Garda fleet, with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015. This significant investment provides the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles for high-visibility road policing which will support important anti-crime strategies such as Operation Thor. Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community. The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems. In fact, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides an additional &euro;205 million for Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan.</p><p>The Government has also ended the moratorium on Garda recruitment and there is provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; this year, bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; who will have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.</p><p>Garda CCTV systems are installed to support crime prevention and as aids to policing. Decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of these Garda systems are a matter for the Commissioner. The Garda authorities inform me that they keep the current Garda CCTV arrangements under ongoing review in the context of changing operational requirements.</p><p>I am conscious, however, of the value that communities place on CCTV and with this in mind, I have instigated a review of the effectiveness of the Community CCTV Scheme in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  The outcome of that review will inform future decisions on the continuation of the Scheme.  The Deputy may also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, has announced funding from the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 in relation the provision of CCTV in rural areas.</p><p>In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that I remain in close contact with the Garda Commissioner with a view to ensuring that we continue to build on the early successes of Operation Thor and that communities in Tipperary and all other areas of the country benefit from the improved legislation and increased investments in policing which the Government has put in place.</p></reply>

An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.

This includes an agreement that all new irregular migrants crossing from Turkey into the Greek islands as and from 20 March will be returned to Turkey. It was also agreed that the return of irregular migrants to Turkey will take place in full accordance with EU and international law. Furthermore, all migrants will be protected in accordance with the relevant international standards and in respect of the principle of non-refoulement.  For each Syrian returned to Turkey under this agreement, the EU will resettle one Syrian in need of international protection directly from Turkey to the EU.  As the Statement notes, this will be a temporary and extraordinary measure which is necessary to end human suffering and to restore public order.</p>  <p>  The Statement does not establish any new commitments on Member States as far as the EU Relocation and Resettlement programmes are concerned under which the Government has already agreed to accept up to 4,000 persons overall under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.</p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute &euro;22.9 million to the Facility for Refugees in Turkey out of the total funding of &euro;3 billion agreed under the Joint EU-Turkey Action Plan, which was activated on 29 November last.  It is important to note that this funding is to support refugees in Turkey and will focus on meeting their immediate needs by providing food, health services and education.  The first projects under the Facility announced by the Commission at the beginning of this month will provide access to formal education for Syrian children in Turkey and humanitarian aid through the World Food Programme which will help to reach 735,000 Syrian refugees with food aid.</p>  <p>  The EU-Turkey Statement commits additional funding of up to &euro;3 billion to the Facility for Refugees only if the original &euro;3 billion is fully spent and if all commitments under the agreement with Turkey are met.  A decision on a contribution to be made by Ireland to this additional funding will be a matter for the incoming administration, if required.</p></reply>

Under the programme Ireland has agreed to accept 4,000 persons in total under resettlement and relocation programmes within a two year period. </p><p>  The figure of 4,000 includes approximately 2,600 asylum seekers to be taken in from migration hotspots in Italy and Greece under the new EU programme and 520 programme refugees from Lebanon and Jordan, which the Irish Government has committed to taking in by the end of 2016 under Ireland's Refugee Resettlement programme.  The mechanism by which the balance of the 4,000 will be taken in, has yet to be decided by Government.</p><p>  While the Government proposal is to accept all 4,000 persons within a two year period, this proposed timeframe is, to a great degree, dependant on external factors including the effectiveness of the measures put in place in migration hotspots in Greece and Italy to support the EU relocation mechanism and the rapidly changing political landscape at EU level. </p><p>It is not expected that Ireland&rsquo;s commitment for a total of 4,000 refugees will be affected by the new arrangement between the European Union and Turkey although the mix of relocation and resettlement may be need to be adjusted.</p></reply>

With this in mind, an Inter-Departmental Group, led by this Department, was established with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.</p><p>The Group concluded its work and its recommendations were fully accepted and funded by Government.  I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement the new model.  The work of this Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability.  The model, when fully operational, will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These are:-</p><p><b>- An Inclusive Culture</b>: includes training dedicated <i>Inclusion Co-ordinators</i>in pre-schools, and a small capitation increase for particular childcare services to support fully inclusive practice;</p><p><b>- Information for Parents and Providers:</b>includes development of a national website and information packs for parents and providers;</p><p><b>-A Qualified and Confident Workforce:</b>resourcing formal and informal training for early years practitioners to support more inclusive provision;</p><p><b>-Expert Educational Advice &amp;amp; Support:</b>enhancing the <i>Better Start</i>Early Years Specialist Service so that practitioners have prompt access to advice and support from experts in early years education for children with disabilities;</p><p><b>-Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations:</b>capital grants to fund specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology, or minor building alterations so that children with disabilities can participate in pre-school;</p><p><b>-Therapeutic Intervention:</b>additional resources to enable access to HSE therapeutic services, where these are needed to allow a child enrol, and fully participate in, pre-school.</p><p><b>-Additional Assistance:</b>where the supports available at levels 1-6 are not sufficient to meet a child&rsquo;s needs, additional capitation can be made available to childcare providers to support the pre-school leader to ensure children&rsquo;s full participation. This could include, for example, buying in additional support, or, in particular circumstances, reducing the staff:child ratio.</p><p>Two groups have been established to oversee and implement the new model; a Cross Sectorial Implementation Group will oversee and monitor implementation, while the second group, the Project Group, will implement the model for roll-out by September 2016.  Further details are expected to be available in June this year and it is expected that children will begin to benefit from these measures from September 2016. </p><p>Separately, the ECCE programme includes an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification where children, including children with a disability, would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  The City and County Childcare Committees continue to provide information and support for parents, on some occasions assisting to access supports locally and providing training for early years providers.</p><p>There is no additional funding available to this Department to support the employment of special needs assistants in pre-school services in this school year.  As you are aware the HSE does, on an ad hoc basis, make some supports available and it is expected that these arrangements will continue until the new model has been established.</p></reply>

With this in mind, an Inter-Departmental Group, led by this Department, was established with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.</p><p>The Group concluded its work and its recommendations were fully accepted and funded by Government.  I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement the new model.  The work of this Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability.  The model, when fully operational, will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These are:-</p><p>- <b>An Inclusive Culture</b>: includes training dedicated <i>Inclusion Co-ordinators</i>in pre-schools, and a small capitation increase for particular childcare services to support fully inclusive practice;</p><p><b>-Information for Parents and Providers:</b>includes development of a national website and information packs for parents and providers;</p><p><b>-A Qualified and Confident Workforce:</b>resourcing formal and informal training for early years practitioners to support more inclusive provision;</p><p><b>-Expert Educational Advice &amp;amp; Support:</b>enhancing the <i>Better Start</i>Early Years Specialist Service so that practitioners have prompt access to advice and support from experts in early years education for children with disabilities;</p><p><b>-Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations:</b>capital grants to fund specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology, or minor building alterations so that children with disabilities can participate in pre-school;</p><p><b>-Therapeutic Intervention:</b>additional resources to enable access to HSE therapeutic services, where these are needed to allow a child enrol, and fully participate in, pre-school.</p><p><b>- Additional Assistance:</b>where the supports available at levels 1-6 are not sufficient to meet a child&rsquo;s needs, additional capitation can be made available to childcare providers to support the pre-school leader to ensure children&rsquo;s full participation. This could include, for example, buying in additional support, or, in particular circumstances, reducing the staff:child ratio.</p><p>Two groups have been established to oversee and implement the new model; a Cross Sectorial Implementation Group will oversee and monitor implementation, while the second group, the Project Group, will implement the model for roll-out by September 2016.  Further details are expected to be available in June this year and it is expected that children will begin to benefit from these measures from September 2016. </p><p>Separately, the ECCE programme includes an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification where children, including children with a disability, would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  The City and County Childcare Committees continue to provide information and support for parents, on some occasions assisting to access supports locally and providing training for early years providers.</p><p>There is no additional funding available to this Department to support the employment of special needs assistants in pre-school services in this school year.  As you are aware the HSE does, on an ad hoc basis, make some supports available and it is expected that these arrangements will continue until the new model has been established.</p></reply>

The greater proportion of this funding was allocated for the development of community childcare services throughout the country.

This funding is targeted at early years pre-school providers that are making alterations to their services to accommodate the increased numbers of children eligible for the free pre-school provision following my decision to expand the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The number of children availing of the programme will increase from approximately 67,000 per year to 127,000 per year following the full roll out of the expanded pre-school provision.  </p>  <p>  The maximum grant available under the programme is &euro;10,000 and full information and application details will be available shortly.

A network of 60 organisations provides services to victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence in Ireland, including 20 services providing emergency refuge accommodation to women and children and 24 community-based domestic violence services. </p>  <p>  Currently, Donegal Women&rsquo;s Domestic Violence Service, which is funded by Tusla, provides services to women and families throughout Donegal, including Inishowen. The service involves the provision of a 24-hour freephone helpline, safe accommodation and outreach services across all areas of Donegal for women and children who are at risk or have suffered abuse within the family. Outreach supports (e.g one to one support; advocacy in accessing other services; safety planning etc.) are provided at a range of health service, community venues and other locations across Inishowen that are accessible and safe for individual women. Recently, there has been a move towards the provision of more mobile arrangements for meeting with service users rather than the "clinic" approach used previously, which enables greater flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of women. This is a development which Tusla encourages to make the best use of resources. </p>  <p>  Tusla does not provide core funding to Lifeline Inishowen. While it recognises the work of Lifeline Inishowen, Tusla considers that there would be an inevitable duplication of service provision in the Inishowen area and a risk of fragmentation of services if several organisations were to provide similar services within the same geographical area.  In the circumstances Tusla is not in a position to provide separate funding to Lifeline Inishowen for a similar service as that which is already funded. </p>  <p>  I understand that Tusla has recently written to Lifeline outlining service arrangements for domestic violence services in Donegal and the specific service arrangements in place to provide a Donegal-wide service to women and families who experience domestic abuse. </p>  <p>  Tusla has also been in contact with Donegal Women&rsquo;s Domestic Violence Service about the proposed cessation of the Lifeline Inishowen service, and I understand that Tusla has been assured by Donegal Women's Domestic Violence Service that it is in a position to respond to service needs in Inishowen. </p>  <p>  Tusla will continue to consider the needs of those who experience domestic violence in Co. Donegal as part of its planning processes, in order to ensure that appropriate responses are in place and that resources are used to achieve the best outcomes for individuals, children and families.</p></reply>

To provide for the implementation of the legislative changes to the Child Care Act 1991 which were enacted through the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, it was necessary to carry out a root and branch re-examination of the 2006 Regulations, including a re-structuring of the Regulations in line with the latest drafting practices.  This exercise has proved to be more time-consuming that originally envisaged, but is now nearing completion.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I am very anxious that everyone working directly with children in the early years sector should have an appropriate qualification in paediatric first aid.  There is currently no accredited award in paediatric first aid at any level on the National Qualifications Framework.  There are a number of companies delivering courses in paediatric first aid, but the content and delivery of the courses is unregulated.  What is required is an external quality assurance process to ensure that the institutions which will provide the training leading to the qualification have the necessary skills and competencies to deliver such a course.</p>  <p>  My Department has now secured agreement with the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) on a paediatric first aid standard,  a paediatric first aid instructor standard, and a process to accredit appropriate institutions to deliver the courses and assess and certify students. The completion of this process will facilitate the inclusion of  a first aid provision in the regulations in the future.</p></reply>

It is important to understand the background to the situation described:  My Department implements a number of childcare support programmes including the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes.  Pobal works closely with this Department in implementing these programmes and undertakes a compliance process to verify, through on-site visits, that the conditions of the various programmes are being complied with. Pobal also carries out audits at the request of the Department. </p>  <p>  Following an audit of the West Clare Early Years (WCEY) Group , Pobal submitted a report to West Clare Early Years (WCEY) in November 2015. This report identified major governance issues and the need for repayment of over-claimed childcare funding.  The Board of WCEY accepted the findings of the report and, at a meeting with Pobal  on February 10th, agreed to prepare an action plan to resolve the situation.  However, the Board of WCEY subsequently took a decision on February 13th to liquidate the company and to close the childcare services under its management with immediate effect. Neither the Department nor Pobal were consulted about the decision to liquidate. </p>  <p>  Since that time, Pobal and Clare County Childcare Committee have been working intensively on behalf of my Department to identify sustainable solutions that will restore childcare provision in West Clare.  It is essential that replacement services have appropriate governance and management. Pobal, Clare County Childcare Committee and officials in my Department are continuing to do all they can to support and facilitate the re-opening of services including Kildysart Community Cr&egrave;che in a proper manner, and I am confident that the situation will be resolved as soon as possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-03-22a.813.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016032200077#WRN01300"><p>I am aware that there is a lot of concern and worry among cystic fibrosis (CF) sufferers and parents and families of children who have CF about the current debate on the cost and availability of this medicine.  I met with Cystic Fibrosis Ireland on Monday 25th January to discuss the matter.</p>  <p>  Orkambi is a combination drug for the treatment of CF in patients with two copies of a specific CF gene mutation.  The drug was licensed by the US. Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by the European Medicines Agency on the 19th of November 2015.  In other words, Orkambi has only been licensed for use in the European Union within the last few months.  To date, it has not been approved for reimbursement by any public health service in Europe. </p>  <p>  Each country has its own process for approval.  The Irish process is laid down in law in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Under this law, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the law.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.</p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available to the HSE.  The process for approval of high-tech new drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a Rapid Review, which has been done.  The second involves a full Health Technology Assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  This expert assessment is scientific and objective and will evaluate whether the claims being made about the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, in terms of its impact on life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions, reduced need for transplants etc.  The NCPE will also consider which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price being quoted by the manufacturer.  This usually takes about 90 days.  I have requested the NCPE to expedite this part of the process to less than 90 days and the Director has confirmed that he believes this can be achieved.</p>  <p>  Once that is done, a recommendation is made to the HSE, which may then engage in price negotiations with the manufacturer.  Orkambi's manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, submitted an application to the HSE on 3 February 2016. </p>  <p>  A similar process is carried out in England by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), which does not expect to make a recommendation until July.</p>  <p>  The process being followed is the same as that for other CF drugs like Kalydeco, new drugs to treat cancer and other rare diseases.  Orkambi will be treated in the same way as these were, and has to be under the law.  This process is designed to secure the best value for the HSE, and the savings that accrue from this process can be used to fund other health service developments, for example isolation rooms for CF and cancer patients, better ambulance services, home supports for the elderly and safer maternity services.</p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for Orkambi to be approved for patients who will benefit from it, and at a fair price, but it must go through the normal approval procedure first, like all other high-tech medicines.</p>  <p>  I understand that, in December, an Opposition politician made a claim that there was a vote on funding this drug in the Seanad.  This is not correct.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad do not vote on whether to fund new medicines.</p></reply>

BCG vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.</p>  <p>  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  The HPRA has tried continually to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date the HPRA have been unable to find a suitable alternative BCG product.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine. </p>  <p>  There have been a number of issues that have delayed the production, release and delivery of BCG vaccine in recent months.  Consequently, supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When the HSE receives the vaccine, they will arrange appointments for vaccination clinics ensuring that those at high risk are offered vaccination first.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

I welcome these proposals, which arise from the current phase of discussions under the on-going framework of engagement between the Department, the HSE and the IMO on the modernisation of the GMS GP contract.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently preparing a Statutory Instrument which would give effect to the proposed arrangements.  Under the legislation, the Statutory Instrument also requires the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The proposed rural practice support framework includes a change in the qualifying criteria for rural support and an increase in the financial allowance from &euro;16,216 to &euro;20,000 per annum.  At present, 167 GPs benefit from the existing RPA.  Under the new arrangements, it is expected that significantly more GPs will benefit from rural practice supports.   </p>  <p>  The proposed changes to the special items of service aim to encourage more services being provided in the primary care setting.  The revised special items include increased rates of payment for suturing and bladder catheterisation, reflecting the costs and time associated with these services; and the introduction of a 24-hour blood pressure monitoring service by GPs.</p>  <p>  As the information requested by the Deputy relating to the number of rural General Practitioners expected to retire in each of the next five years is not routinely provided to my Department, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply directly to the Deputy on this matter.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-03-22a.908.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016032200078#WRO02500"><p>The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are  terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  Eligibility, in these circumstances, is granted to a named individual for a period of six months.  These are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. </p><p>Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is founded primarily on the undue financial hardship test.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.  </p><p>In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>with a key recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  </p><p>It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE as evidenced by the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation, which has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 102,000 at the beginning of March 2016.</p><p>On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years.  The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions. </p><p>We do not have a universal eligibility system for primary and community health services.  Until we have universal health care and everyone is entitled to health care, one will always have anomalies.  There will always be somebody who is just above a means threshold, or who does not have a prescribed disease, or whose condition is not sufficiently severe and, as a result, these individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p>  <p>  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.   </p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil have been distributed worldwide.  In Ireland 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 200,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  </p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  </p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  </p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states. </p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I want to make it quite clear that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.  </p>  <p>  As Minister I consider meeting any organisation that requests to do so.  However due to busy parliamentary work and other business it is not always possible to meet all representative groups.  I have been informed that the HSE has met with members of REGRET concerning this issue.</p></reply>

The call for submissions asked for the views of the public on the <i>Disability Policy Report</i>prepared by the Policy Expert Reference Group, which was established to advise the Disability Services Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review Steering Group.</p><p>The submissions were considered carefully and taken into account by the VFM Steering Group in finalising their Report on the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland, which was published in July 2012.  The Review, which is currently being implemented by the Health Service Executive, recommended a significant restructuring of the Disability Services Programme through migration from an approach which is predominantly organised around group-based service delivery towards a model of person-centred, individually chosen, supports; and implementation of a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use.</p></reply>

A key objective of Government policy for older people, children and adults with disabilities is to support them to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Carers are vital to the achievement of this objective and are considered a backbone of care provision in Ireland.</p><p>The letter furnished with the Deputy's Question raises issues which extend beyond the direct remit of the Department of Health and which require responses from a number of Government Department's and agencies. In recognition of the diverse range of issues which impact on carers, the National Carers' Strategy states that &ldquo;Each Department will have responsibility for the implementation of actions for which they have been allocated responsibility.

Unfortunately, as a result it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of items reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes.  This includes gluten-free products. </p>  <p>  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies. Coeliac patients can also claim medical expenses tax relief on expenditure incurred on gluten-free products manufactured specifically for coeliacs. There are no plans to reinstate these products on the list of reimbursable items under the GMS and other community drug schemes.</p></reply>

This includes projects which delivered a new emergency department, new endoscopy department and operating theatre air handling and chiller replacement, enhancement to the operating theatre electrical back-up power supplies, operating theatre changing rooms, and minor environmental upgrades to operating theatre corridor and theatre suites. The HSE, in its 2016 National Service Plan (at Appendix 4 Page 135), states that the blood sciences project which involves the extension and refurbishment of pathology laboratory will be completed and operational by end 2016.  The estimated cost is &euro;0.7m  An agreed rolling plan is being put in place to address further infrastructure needs including the project referred to and associated costs. </p>  <p>  There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.  As with all capital projects, the further development of the health care infrastructure, including University Hospital Kerry, must be considered within the context of the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  Any future investment must also be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme and establishment of hospital groups. Each hospital group will be required to develop a strategic plan to describe how it will provide more efficient and effective patient services and reorganise its services to provide optimal care to the populations it serves.  The HSE will continue to apply the available funding for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs. </p></reply>

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin. Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further. The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.  The Department of Health is continuing to work with the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the hospitals themselves to ensure that we continue to make strong progress in addressing this issue and to identify all options to further improve access times. </p>  <p>  As the specific issues raised are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin. Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further. The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.  The Department of Health is continuing to work with the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the hospitals themselves to ensure that we continue to make strong progress in addressing this issue and to identify all options to further improve access times. </p>  <p>  As the specific issues raised are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

It is important that consideration be given to how best to provide public funding for fertility treatment in conjunction with closing the legislative gap in this area of healthcare.  To that end, my officials are currently drafting a General Scheme of legislative provisions dealing with AHR.  Drafting of the General Scheme is ongoing and it is envisaged that it will be published in the first half of 2016.</p><p>I have commissioned an evidence review of international public funding models.  The review will inform policy regarding the ideal mechanism for any future public funding of AHR in the State.  It is expected that the evidence review will be completed before the end of 2016 and that once the AHR legislation is enacted the Government will be in a position to provide fertility treatments based on the best model of funding for Ireland. </p><p>It is important to note that while <i>in vitro</i>fertilisation (IVF) treatment is not provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE). Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself does not establish eligibility for a medical card. </p><p>In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p><p>The HSE has specific procedures in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation. An emergency situation can apply to persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons who are  terminally ill. However, with the exception of terminally ill patients all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility. Eligibility, in these circumstances, is granted to a named individual for a period of six months. These are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. For terminally ill persons, no means test applies and the cards are not reviewed.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>with a key recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years.  The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions. </p><p>It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straightforward manner. Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE as evidenced by the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation, which has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 102,000 at the beginning of March 2016.</p><p>We do not have a universal eligibility system for primary and community health services. Until we have universal health care and everyone is entitled to health care, one will always have anomalies. There will always be somebody who is just above a means threshold, or who does not have a prescribed disease, or whose condition is not sufficiently severe and, as a result, these individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.</p></reply>

The plan includes the development of a new 130 bed centre, centrally located in Letterkenny to ensure that bed capacity in the region, which includes Ramelton, Lifford and Stranolar is secured on a sustainable basis.</p>  <p>  Given the requirement for additional services to provide for the needs for older persons right around the country, including Donegal, there will, in parallel with residential beds, be an ongoing need for the provision of short stay services such as rehabilitation, respite, step up and step down facilities, all with a view of maintaining older people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  In planning for the coming years the use and purpose of the current buildings in Ramelton, Lifford and Stranorlar will be considered in order to ensure that an appropriate service is provided for the older people living in their own community in Donegal.</p>  <p>  While the detailed operational planning for future service provision in this context is a matter for the HSE, if a representative of the Group contacts my Office I will consider their meeting request.</p></reply>

It was estimated that 350 women would apply to the Scheme, but in fact 578 applications have been accepted by the Scheme and as of 4 March 2016, 365 awards have been made.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has brought to an end years of uncertainty and costs for women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomy, whose only option prior to its establishment was to take legal action through the courts, with no certainty about the outcome of that action.  The Scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial and aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned.  The Scheme was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment. </p>  <p>  In the interest of accountability, the Scheme requires each Applicant to prove that she had a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in order to be considered for the assessment of an award of &euro;50,000.  It is solely a matter for the Assessor to determine whether an Applicant has identified and established any significant disability by objective evidence if the Applicant is seeking a higher award of &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000.  Judge Clark, Assessor to the Scheme has informed Department officials that where medical records are not obtainable to support a woman's application, then arrangements are made to have such applicants examined by a gynaecologist for the presence of a surgical symphysiotomy scar and by a radiologist to establish the extent of any pubis symphysis widening. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is voluntary and women do not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.</p>  <p>  The remuneration for Judge Clark, Assessor to the Scheme has been approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in line with salary payable to a High Court Judge.</p>  <p>  The Government has given careful and detailed consideration to this complex and sensitive matter.  It believes that the provision of the Scheme, together with the ongoing provision of medical services by the HSE, including medical cards, represents a comprehensive and fair response to this issue, which should help bring resolution for the women, many of whom are elderly, and their families.  </p></reply>

Treating clinicians are required to apply to the HSE's Medicines Management Programme in order to commence a screening process for their respective patients.  These arrangements would not permit the drug to be used for the treatment of a condition beyond the terms of the Marketing Authorisation and where evidence of clinical benefit has not been demonstrated.

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.  Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further.  The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits.</p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is continuing to work with the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the hospitals themselves to ensure that we continue to make strong progress in addressing this issue and to identify all options to further improve access times for surgery.</p>  <p>  As the specific issues raised are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-03-22a.1098.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016032200081#WRR02800"><p>Part 6 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that registered providers of nursing home care are required to effect a contract of insurance against injury to residents.  They may also insure against other risks, such as loss or damage to a resident&rsquo;s property, at their discretion.  The Department of Health has no role in setting prices for insurance for private nursing homes.  This is a matter between the nursing home and their insurance provider.</p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p>  <p>  -  Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p>  <p>  -  Price(s) previously charged,</p>  <p>  -  Local market price, and</p>  <p>  -  Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The Department of Health has no role in such individual negotiations.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  Pricing contracts are purely a matter for agreement between the NTPF and the nursing home in question.</p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The report of the review was published in July 2015 and identifies a number of key issues for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.  The report recommends that the National Treatment Purchase Fund review the present pricing arrangements with a view to ensuring value, increasing transparency and ensuring adequate capacity for those with complex needs.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The Working Group is due to report on its progress to the Cabinet Committee on Health in June 2016.</p></reply>

However, a number of significant projects have been completed at Galway University Hospital in recent years.  These include the Clinical Research Facility, the upgrade to the Maternity Unit and The CF out-patient department which was completed in 2014 and is now operational.  </p>  <p>  The HSE Capital Plan 2016 includes funding for a full option appraisal and Cost Benefit Analysis to inform planning and funding requirements for a new ED at GUH. A cost benefit analysis in relation to a new ED is in its final stages and it is anticipated that this will be completed in March 2016. If favourable, this will go to design phase in 2016.</p>  <p>  Pending the development of a new ED in GUH, in order to alleviate pressures and to ensure that patient experience in the existing GUH ED is improved, there are two major developments currently underway in Galway. The HSE made over &euro;2 million available in 2015 to develop an additional 30 beds in GUH in order to reduce overcrowding. 17 of these beds opened on the 4th January 2016 with the remaining 13 opening on the 14th March 2016.</p>  <p>  Further construction work is also ongoing on the new 75 bed ward block which will provide single room in-patient accommodation. A new acute mental health department is underway and is expected to be completed early in 2017.  Following the transfer of mental health services to the new acute department work will begin on the construction of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology project for which the HSE has already obtained planning permission.</p>  <p>  Any future investment must be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme and establishment of hospital groups. Each hospital group will be required to develop a strategic plan to describe how it will provide more efficient and effective patient services and reorganise its services to provide optimal care to the populations it serves.</p></reply>

At present, 167 GPs benefit from the existing RPA.  Under the new arrangements, it is expected that significantly more GPs will benefit from rural practice supports.   </p>  <p>  The proposed changes to the special items of service aim to encourage more services being provided in the primary care setting.

HIQA is the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007, and all nursing homes, whether public, private or voluntary, are required to be registered and inspected by the HIQA.  </p><p>Furthermore, the legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.</p><p>The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and neither the Department of Health nor the HSE can influence the process.  The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  Pricing contracts are entirely a matter for agreement between the NTPF and the nursing home in question. </p><p>In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p><p>-  costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p><p>-  price(s) previously charged,</p><p>-  local market price, and</p><p>-  budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>If negotiations between nursing home proprietors and the NTPF cannot reach agreement there is a three stage review process available: details are set out on the NTPF website at <i>www.ntpf.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has decided to convene this high-level international meeting to bring together world leaders during the opening week of the UN General Assembly, to address the need for long term strategies and commitments on migration and refugees.  The meeting will follow on from the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in May, which will address the unprecedented scale of humanitarian crisis and conflict worldwide, which have resulted in the displacement of some 60 million people from their homes.   The Irish and Jordanian Ambassadors have begun their consultations with the 193 UN member states on the organisational arrangements for the September Summit.  These include consideration of the arrangements for participation by representatives of civil society organisations.

While there have been divergent views among some member states about the best way to address the crisis, the Union has nonetheless succeeded in developing a comprehensive strategy aimed at addressing the root causes of the crisis; meeting the humanitarian needs of refugees; and reducing the large numbers of migrants arriving in Europe.  The problem has been in the implementation of this strategy.  Turkey has a key role to play if the migration crisis is to be managed, as the majority of migrants entering the EU transit Turkey. In November, the EU and Turkey agreed a Joint Action Plan, a central element of which was that Turkey would work to stop the flow of illegal migrants transiting Turkey.    In a renewed attempt to get Turkey to do more to implement this plan, EU leaders met with the Turkish Prime Minister twice this month, on 7 March and on 17/18 March. In order to break the business model of the smugglers and to offer migrants an alternative to putting their lives at risk, the EU and Turkey agreed to end the irregular migration from Turkey to the EU. In order to achieve this goal, they agreed on the following:</p>  <p>  1) All new irregular migrants crossing from Turkey into Greek islands as from 20 March 2016 will be returned to Turkey. This will take place in full accordance with EU and international law, thus excluding any kind of collective expulsion. All migrants will be protected in accordance with the relevant international standards. It will be a temporary and extraordinary measure which is necessary to end the human suffering. Migrants arriving in the Greek islands will be duly registered and any application for asylum will be processed individually by the Greek authorities in accordance with the Asylum Procedures Directive, in cooperation with UNHCR. Migrants not applying for asylum or whose application has been found unfounded or inadmissible in accordance with the said directive will be returned to Turkey. </p>  <p>  2) For every Syrian being returned to Turkey from Greek islands, another Syrian will be resettled from Turkey to the EU. A mechanism will be established to ensure that this principle will be implemented as from the same day the returns start. On the EU side, resettlement under this mechanism will take place, in the first instance, by honouring the commitments made by the European Council on 20 July 2015, of which 18,000 places for resettlement remain. Any further need for resettlement will be carried out through a similar voluntary arrangement up to a limit of an additional 54,000 persons. Should these arrangements not meet the objective of ending the irregular migration and the number of returns come close to the numbers provided for above, this mechanism will be reviewed. Should the number of returns exceed the numbers provided for above, this mechanism will be discontinued.</p>  <p>  3) Turkey has agreed to take any necessary measures to prevent new sea or land routes for illegal migration opening from Turkey to the EU, and will cooperate with neighbouring states as well as the EU to this effect.</p>  <p>  4) Once irregular crossings between Turkey and the EU are ending or at least have been substantially and sustainably reduced, a Voluntary Humanitarian Admission Scheme will be activated. EU Member States will contribute on a voluntary basis to this scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the EU will accelerate visa liberalisation talks with Turkey and if necessary provide additional funding for the support of Syrian refugees in Turkey. The EU has already agreed to provide &euro;3 billion of such funding. Ireland&rsquo;s national contribution to this funding will be over &euro;22 million.</p>  <p>  The agreement reached with Turkey is fully consistent with international and EU law. Ireland and many other EU partners were clear that had to be the case, and the European Council has been assured on that point.  </p>  <p>  Insofar as the Irish response to the migration crisis is concerned, the Government voluntarily decided to accept up to 4,000 migrants. As of now, the resettlement and relocation arrangements agreed &ndash; including those in relation to Turkey - can be met from within this number. We also deployed a number of naval vessels to the Mediterranean which rescued more than 8,500 people. We have also contributed financially to various migration-related initiatives including &euro;42 million in response to the Syria crisis since 2011, and have pledged a further &euro;20 million for this year.</p></reply>

As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade I have engaged extensively on this citizen&rsquo;s case with my Egyptian counterpart, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Sameh Shoukry, and with Egypt&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland, Ms. Soha Gendi. The Taoiseach has raised this case at the highest-level with the Egyptian President, Mr. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.  Officials from my Department and our Embassy in Cairo are in regular and frequent contact with the relevant Egyptian authorities.      </p>  <p>  The Government has also raised the case at senior levels with the European Union and the European External Action Service (EEAS).  I have raised the case directly on a number of occasions with High Representative and Commission Vice President Mogherini, and she in turn has discussed the case with senior Egyptian Government interlocutors.</p>  <p>  The Egyptian Government is in no doubt as to our position on this consular case, our clear determination to see this citizen released at the earliest possible opportunity so that he can return to Ireland and resume his school studies, our concerns about the judicial process and our frustration at the length of time this young person has been detained without having been convicted of any crime.</p>  <p>  The Egyptian authorities, for their part, see this individual as an Egyptian citizen according to their laws.  They argue that he faces charges relating to serious offences and that the judicial process must be allowed to take its course.  </p>  <p>  Since this citizen&rsquo;s arrest in 2013, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and our Embassy in Cairo, have provided extensive consular assistance to him and his family. My officials undertake regular consular visits to the citizen in prison, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade interacts frequently with his family and his Egyptian legal team to provide support and assistance. Such a high level of visitation means that Embassy officials are well-placed to intervene on his behalf when issues in relation to his well-being arise.  A number of interventions related to this citizen&rsquo;s treatment and welfare in detention have been made on his behalf with the Egyptian authorities, and we continue to pay close attention to all aspects of his welfare.  We are satisfied that access to his legal representation is not being impeded, and the citizen receives regular visits from family members.  The most recent consular visit took place on 11 February and was undertaken by the Dublin-based Director of the Consular Division in my Department, accompanied also by officials from our Embassy in Cairo.  Embassy officials have attended all court hearings so far &ndash; another clear demonstration of the importance we attach to this case.</p>  <p>  At the most recent hearing on 6 March, the case was adjourned until 29 June, but the court clerk, when announcing the adjournment, indicated that final decisions in the case will be made at the next hearing.  While this is encouraging, I would caution against assumptions being made regarding the final time-scale or outcome of this case.</p>  <p>  There have been assertions that this citizen could be liable to be given the death penalty if convicted. We raised this very serious point with the Egyptian authorities and we have been advised consistently that there is no possibility of the death penalty being applied in this case on account of the fact that he was a minor at the time of his arrest.  Nonetheless, the charges he faces are serious, and potentially carry significant sentences in the event of his being found guilty. Against this background, we continue to make every effort on this citizen&rsquo;s behalf.</p></reply>

Children with autism over the age of four may also be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>  The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary subject to the willingness of schools to open classes. </p><p>  I understand that the number of special classes for students with ASD in north Dublin is 86, 16 of which are at post primary level, 59 at primary level and 11 are early intervention classes. The NCSE have advised that SENOs are currently liaising with schools regarding the establishment of further classes in the Dublin city and Dublin North areas for 2016/17 school year.</p><p>With regards to the particular school referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the school currently has an enrolment capacity for 42 pupils. </p><p>  I have arranged for the Deputy's request for specific detail in relation to placement availability in the school referred to, to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

These Arrangements require Bus &Eacute;ireann to charge my Department for all direct costs- contractors, fuel, maintenance etc. In line with the Accounting Arrangements, a charge of 13% of certain direct costs is levied to cover all other costs associated with the School Transport Scheme. This is commonly referred to as the School Transport Management Charge.</p><p>  The School Transport Management Charge is used to defray immediate overheads incurred by Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of the School Transport Scheme. Any surplus which may remain, after accounting for the overheads referred to above is used to provide a reserve for additional expenditure which may be required in connection with the Scheme; this is commonly referred to within the Company as the risk reserve fund.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  Circular 0030/2014 sets out the role of medical/ other professional reports and recommendations by medical/ other professionals in the context of consideration of applications for SNA support by the NCSE. The Circular explains that, while professional reports provide valuable assistance to education providers in identifying a diagnosis or identifying appropriate interventions, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO. </p><p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year by 29th February 2016. SENOs will continue to process applications for access to SNA support which are received after this deadline. Such applications will be processed in the order in which the applications have been received.</p><p>It should be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs.</p><p>The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  Details of the manner in which a school or parent may appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to support a child in school, to the NCSE, is set out on the NCSE website.</p><p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website.</p><p>  As the matter referred to in this question relates to an allocation for an individual child, I will arrange to have the matter referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The change in payment arrangements has not altered this. Home tutors do not have a contractual relationship with the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>The change in payment arrangements from September 2015 was on foot of instructions from the Revenue Commissioners that payments under the Home Tuition Scheme are subject to statutory deductions at source.</p><p>In order to facilitate parents, my Department agreed to act solely as payroll agents on their behalf. Payment of the home tuition grant now issues directly to the approved tutor via my Department's Non-Teaching Staff payroll.

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  It should be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs.

SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  Details of the manner in which a school or parent may appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to support a child in school, to the NCSE, is set out on the NCSE website.</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website.  </p><p>  As the matter referred to in this question relates to an allocation for an individual child, I will arrange to have the matter referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website www.education.ie, sets out my Department's policy in relation to the Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme. </p><p>The NCSE recently asked all schools to submit applications for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year, including for new pupils who will be enrolling to schools in September, by 29th February, 2016. </p><p>The NCSE will also continue to process applications for access to SNA support which are received after this deadline. Such applications will be processed in the order in which the applications have been received. </p><p>Having considered he applications received, the NCSE will advise all schools of their SNA allocations in advance of the coming school year.</p><p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs. Details of the manner in which a school or parent may appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to support a child in school, to the NCSE, is set out on the NCSE website. </p><p>I also wish to advise the Deputy that Circular 0030/2014 explains that SNA support is not provided to pre-school services which operate outside of the primary or special school provision. </p><p>I can advise, however, that the vast majority of supports for childcare, including pre-school education, is provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school. </p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) currently provides for care support for pupils with special needs attending a range of HSE funded pre-schools. As such, questions relating to provision of such services should be addressed to the HSE, or to my colleague, the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

In this regard, new arrangements were put in place in 2011 for the establishment of new primary and post-primary schools. These arrangements give parents an opportunity to express their preference for the type of new school to be established. Since 2011, forty-five new schools have been established in areas of demographic need and all of these have involved consultation with parents as to their preferred type of school.  Over 90% of the new schools (forty-one out of the forty-five) have a multi-denominational ethos.</p>  <p>  It has also been a priority to expand diversity of provision in the existing school network.

The basic principle of public procurement is that there should be a competitive process and this approach applies to procurement by all public sector bodies, and includes school transport services performed by contractors under the School Transport Scheme. </p><p>  The tendering process is a competitive process which allows Bus &Eacute;ireann to achieve the procurement objectives in terms of value for money, access to the contracts for all interested parties, transparency on how the contracts are  awarded, and equality of treatment.  The rules of the competition and the  selection and award criteria were clearly outlined as to how the contracts would be awarded and all interested parties were provided with the same opportunity and the same information.  In this way the procurement process is carried out in an fair, open and transparent manner complying with all applicable EU Procurement Law, domestic legislation and government regulations. </p><p>  The experience of the driver assigned to perform the service is one of the award criteria, and while previous experience with the company is taken into  account Bus &Eacute;ireann is not permitted to conduct a process which provides an  incumbent operator with an unfair advantage. </p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has further confirmed that, on the basis of legal advice, the recipient of Government funding cannot be automatically excluded from  participating in a public procurement tender competition. </p><p>  Generally a five-year contract is awarded to the successful tenderer.  This  provides security for the duration of the contract to the contractor as well as stability, in terms of familiarity with transport arrangements, for the  families, schools, and children concerned.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the classroom teacher to ensure that each  pupil is taught in a stimulating and supportive classroom environment where all pupils feel equal and valued. </p><p>  The Circular also notes that many children with significant special educational needs require additional teaching support in schools.  In such circumstances, the classroom teacher will be supported by a resource teacher/ /learning support teacher, who are fully qualified teachers who will have access to additional training in the area of special education.  </p><p>  To provide for this additional teaching support, my Department currently allocates over 11,800 additional teachers to schools to support children with special educational or learning support needs.  These allocations are made to schools, either through General Allocation schemes for primary and post-primary schools, or through additional allocations made to schools by the NCSE in  respect of Low Incidences disabilities, as set out in my Departments Circular DES 02/05.  </p><p>  Such additional teaching support allocations are made to schools in addition to  any SNA provision. </p><p>  The Circular therefore notes that although the SNA can provide useful assistance to the teacher in ensuring that the pupil is able to access education, the role of the SNA is not to provide additional tuition, as this is the role of qualified learning support/resource teachers who may assist the teacher to provide additional teaching to pupils with special educational needs. </p><p>  In order to provide further clarity in relation to the SNA scheme, my  Department also asked the NCSE to prepare an Information Booklet for parents which has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

A school's GAM/EAL allocation for the 2016/17 school year is based on its mainstream classroom posts for the 2015/16 school year. Schools can also enter into cluster arrangements with neighbouring schools to make a full-time GAM/EAL post  (25 hours).  Following the school-led process for clustering GAM/EAL hours the school in question has entered into an arrangement to share the post with a neighbouring school and so retains the GAM/EAL post on a shared basis.</p></reply>

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website. The Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in Budget 2016 for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year. These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p><p>  At primary level there will be a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule to be implemented for the 2016/17 school year. This will see the primary staffing schedule operate on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils. At primary level lower thresholds apply for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p><p>  At post-primary level the schedule will improve by .3 points, from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year. When the allocation for guidance was brought within quota under Budget 2012 measures, DEIS schools were protected from the change by providing for a 18.25:1 allocation compared to the general 19:1 allocation. The position of DEIS schools will be further enhanced for the 2016/17 school year by a change to an allocation on the basis of 17.95:1.</p><p>  The staffing arrangements also include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. Details of the appeals criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.</p><p>  The staffing and redeployment arrangements for all schools for the 2016/17 school year were published early in 2016. The final staffing position for 2016/17 for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Boards will have been considered.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  Circular 0030/2014 sets out the role of professional reports and recommendations by medical/other professionals in the context of consideration of applications for SNA support by the NCSE. The Circular explains that, while professional reports provide valuable assistance to education providers in identifying a diagnosis or identifying appropriate interventions, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO. </p><p>It should also be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs.  The deployment of SNA support and organisation of resource teaching support within schools is a matter for individual schools to manage, taking into account each child's individual needs.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  I understand that the school referred to in the Deputy's question currently has an allocation of four SNAs.</p><p>  Should the school wish to make an application for additional SNA support, they may make such an application to the NCSE.</p><p>  The NCSE recently asked all schools to submit applications for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year, including for any new applications, by 29th February, 2016.</p><p>The NCSE will also continue to process applications for access to SNA support which are received after this deadline. Such applications will be processed in the order in which the applications have been received.</p><p>  Having considered the applications received, the NCSE will advise all schools of their SNA allocations in advance of the coming school year.</p><p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs.</p><p>  Details of the manner in which a school or parent may appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to support a child in school, to the NCSE, is set out on the NCSE website.</p><p>Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that, for children who, for a number of reasons have been unable to attend school due to a significant medical condition, my Department may provide a compensatory educational service through the Home Tuition scheme. In this regard I understand that, in addition to this pupil's reduced attendance in school, funding is being provided through the Home Tuition scheme for the pupil referred to by the Deputy, in order to support this pupil's re-integration back in to school.</p></reply>

The most recent information relating to vacant residential units can be found in the 2011 census data which is available on the CSO website, .  Insofar as Unfinished Housing Developments are concerned, the 2015 National Housing Development Survey and the Annual Progress Report illustrate that good progress is continuing to be made in resolving unfinished developments and the reactivation of sites is now evident throughout the country.  The detailed findings of the annual surveys, annual progress reports and other useful publications and information in relation to Unfinished Housing Developments are available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>.  Since 2010, an annual national housing survey of unfinished housing developments has been conducted during the summer months to monitor progress.  In that period, the number of unfinished housing developments has decreased by approximately three-quarters, from nearly 3,000<b></b>in 2010 to 668 in 2015. </p><p>With regard to the remediation of vacant social houses, the <i>Social Housing Strategy </i>provides for a target-driven voids retrofitting programme.  Between 2014 and 2015, some 5,000 such units were remediated with the support of my Department and were made available to those on housing waiting lists. </p><p>In those two years, my Department has provided some &euro;60 million in funding to local authorities for this purpose.  This investment is a very significant support to deal with the backlog of vacant social units and a key element in the early addressing of social housing need.</p><p>In addition, the acquisitions programme is an important component of social housing supply and is particularly important as a parallel stream of supply while the construction programme builds momentum.  All local authorities have been given approval to explore options for augmenting construction supply with carefully targeted acquisitions.  In this regard, local authorities acquired some 1,000 units in 2015, as published in the Social Housing Output in 2015 report, which available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p></reply>

The overall aim of the Directive is to maintain high and good status waters where they exist and to restore waters that do not currently support aquatic ecosystems adequately.  River basin management planning, structured in 6-year cycles, is the tool prescribed by the Directive for achieving these aims.   </p>  <p>  In July 2010, the first cycle River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) for Ireland were published, covering the period up to 2015.  The RBMPs, which were adopted by all the local authorities, describe the measures planned to protect and improve Ireland&rsquo;s water environment covering rivers, lakes, groundwater, transitional (estuaries) and coastal waters. </p>  <p>  Member States are required to outline in RBMPs the planned steps to implement Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive which requires Member States to take account of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services, in accordance with the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  This is in order to ensure that water-pricing policies incentivise the efficient use of water resources and thereby contribute to achieving the environmental objectives of the Directive.   </p>  <p>  The intention to charge for domestic water charges was set out in the first round of RBMPs and this was recognised in the European Commission&rsquo;s 2012 report to the European Parliament and the European Council on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Ireland.   </p>  <p>  The second-cycle RBMPs for the period up to 2021 are in preparation at the moment, and the draft plans are due to be published in December 2016.  A six-month public consultation process will take place in the first half of 2017 and the finalised second-cycle RBMPs are due for completion by the end of 2017, after which they will be forwarded to the European Commission.  As such, the question of withdrawing or amending the second cycle RBMPs does not arise.   </p></reply>

The most recent published information covering all local authorities is as at 31/12/2014.  The information recorded and published is in respect of re-letting times and accordingly, the response of those on the waiting list to offers of such social houses, once remediated, can be a factor in the times recorded. </p><p>The time taken to turn around vacant social houses varies from property to property and depends on the level of refurbishment required for each individual property.  I have placed a high priority as Minister on supporting local authorities to return vacant social housing units to productive use for those on the housing waiting list.  Between 2014 and 2015, some 5,000 such units were remediated with the support of my Department and were made available to those on housing waiting lists.  In those two years, my Department has provided some &euro;60 million in funding for this purpose.  This investment is a very significant support to deal with the backlog of vacant social housing units and a key element in the early addressing of social housing need.</p><p>I should point out that there will always be a level of vacant social housing stock and the numbers, the precise units and the times taken to return them to use will fluctuate on an ongoing basis dependent on, for example, the condition of the houses when vacated.  As social houses become vacant, local authorities must establish the remediation work, if any, that is required for their early re-tenanting.  Between the additional staffing resources I have made available to local authorities, as well as the &euro; 60 million direct funding I have provided to date, local authorities are continuing to receive strong support to maximise the use of their stock and its early availability for tenanting.</p></reply>

In relation to rent stability, the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is being increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4 year period.  In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced.  Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment.Further provisions to support rent stability in the 2015 Act include:</p><p>-  that notice of new rent sent must be in a prescribed form, include details of dispute resolution procedures available through the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) and be accompanied by details of rent in respect of 3 comparable dwellings in the area;</p><p>-  that notification of a rent increase to the PRTB will include, among other things, a signed statement by the tenant that they are aware of their rights in relation to rent and rent reviews;</p><p>The most recent PRTB rent index shows that in the fourth quarter of 2015, rents were 9.8% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2014 although the rate of increase slowed in the final quarter of last year, with a slightly lower growth in Dublin than elsewhere.  However, it is expected that the impact of the new rent certainty measures will be reflected in the statistics for the first quarter of 2016 when available in a couple of months.</p><p>Ultimately, the key to addressing rising rents in the medium to long term is through increasing the supply of housing and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts, including through <i>Construction 2020; A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>and the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>. </p></reply>

In discussions prior to the adoption of the 2007 Tyre Regulations, it was made clear that this was the last opportunity for the tyre industry to embrace environmental compliance and take responsibility for the waste it produces.  If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model. </p><p>As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed.  The results of this examination were stark.  The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:</p><p>- A non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,</p><p>- A lack of consistent and accurate data,</p><p>- That the current system was not tracking data flows well, and</p><p>- Between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for with widespread illegal dumping.</p><p>Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry through the establishment of a Tyres Working Group, I announced my decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015.  Since my decision, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.</p><p>There will be no new tyre tax or levy under the new system being introduced; consumers already pay a disposal fee to their tyre retailer whenever they buy a new tyre.  The model that I am introducing will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply but which does not currently go towards the cost of managing the waste in all cases, as it is supposed to.  It is absolutely right and fair to provide a system that ensures that the existing levy is properly directed in the future, so that the consumer does not pay twice - once at the point of purchase and again when the taxpayer has to meet costs incurred by local authorities for the clean-up of illegally dumped tyres.  </p><p>My Department is currently awaiting a submission from the tyre industry regarding the new structures.</p></reply>

Census 2016 is to be taken on 24 April 2016 and the Central Statistics Office expect to publish the preliminary results in July of this year.  The function of the Constituency Commission is to make a report on the constituencies for the election of members of the D&aacute;il and the members of the European Parliament having regard to Article 16 of the Constitution and to the terms of reference set out in section 6(2) of the Electoral Act 1997. </p>  <p>  In accordance with section 9 of the Electoral Act 1997 the Constituency Commission must present its report to the Chairperson of the D&aacute;il no later than 3 months after the publication of final census results.

The measures include the introduction of a vacant site levy; reductions in development contributions and a targeted development contribution rebate scheme in Dublin and Cork to encourage large scale developments at affordable prices; revised Part V provisions; initiatives to improve financing; implementation of new apartment guidelines; and legislative amendments to introduce greater flexibility and streamlining to the Strategic Development Zone provisions of the Planning and Development Acts.  In addition, NAMA is aiming to deliver 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list with flexibility to meet future demand.  In total, 110,000 new social housing units are targeted for delivery with 35,000 new units to be delivered and 75,000 households to be supported , mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme.</p><p>Evidence that the Strategy is delivering can be found in the report, Social Housing Output in 2015, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>As a result of the focused approach adopted in 2015, some 13,000 social housing units were provided, representing an 86% increase on the 7,000 units delivered in 2014.  I am committed, while I remain as Minister, to maintain the momentum achieved in 2015 and, to that end, an ambitious target of a further 17,000 units has been set for delivery in 2016.</p><p>A significant number of measures are being taken to address homelessness by securing a supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  These measures have been identified in the Government's Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness (May 2014) and in the Action Plan to Address Homelessness(December 2014).  Substantial progress has been made in implementing these plans.  Progress in implementing these plans is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>These Plans represent a whole-of-Government approach to dealing with homelessness and the implementation of measures identified in these plans is being overseen by a group of senior officials drawn from key State agencies concerned including my Department, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health , the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Health Service Executive, Tusla, the Irish Prison Service and housing authorities. </p></reply>

In general the mortgage must be in negative equity   with some cases of positive equity considered on a case by case basis.  The household must also be deemed eligible for social housing. </p>  <p>  Once a case comes within the criteria and the householder has provide d consent to the lender to share information, the Housing Agency seeks an Approved Housing Body to complete the transaction and prepares a submission to my Department for funding approval. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case raised, I understand from the Housing Agency that it has offered this property to an AHB and a survey has been carried out to ascertain both the condition of the property and to identify any repairs required.

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.  Donegal County Council, in partnership with my Department, has made substantial progress in modernising fire stations in County Donegal and has replaced 12 of its 15 fire stations following investment of some &euro;11 million by my Department over the last fifteen years or so. The following towns in County Donegal are now served by modern fire stations with full facilities: Millford (1998); Buncrana (2000); Letterkenny (HQ) and An Fal Carrach (both in 2003); Carndonagh and Donegal Town (both in 2004); Killybegs (2005); An Clochan Liath, Glenties and Moville (all in 2007); and most recently Gaoth Dobhair and Stranorlar (2009). </p>  <p>  In February 2016, I announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on the current annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres. Under this programme, the list of priority projects to be progressed will be kept under review on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  With regard to a fire station project in Glencolmcille, which is not included in the current five-year programme, my Department will have regard to Donegal County Council&rsquo;s priorities and national priorities for funding in further considering any proposal. The status of existing facilities, having regard to area risk categorisation, will also be considered.</p></reply>

The Scheme was piloted in Dublin City and Westmeath County Councils in 2013 and rolled out nationally in 2014. In total, 195 LAMTR cases have been completed to date with a significant number of other cases being progressed by local authorities in the context of their operation of the MARP.</p>  <p>  The LAMTR scheme is similar to the scheme for borrowers with mortgages from private commercial lending institutions, insofar as it also targets low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. Both schemes also ensure that the family remains in their home . In the case of LAMTR, ownership of the home is transferred to a local authority, rather than to an Approved Housing Body (AHB) as is the case under the MTR scheme in the private lending sector. Both schemes require the household to be eligible for social housing in order to access to the scheme.</p>  <p>  At the end of February 2016, a total of 785 cases were either complete or being actively progressed under the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme for borrowers of private commercial lending institutions. Of these 150 cases had completed all stages of the process. In total, since the introduction of the Scheme in 2012, 3,256 cases had been submitted. There are a variety of reasons why cases have not progressed including the householder&rsquo;s circumstances improving during the process, no social housing demand in the area, the householder&rsquo;s income being in excess of the statutory limits for eligibility for social housing, and poor condition of the property. My Department continues to work together with the agencies involved with the Scheme including lenders, to streamline the administrative process and ensure that all potential cases are dealt with speedily and efficiently.</p>  <p>  In addition, the package of commitments on mortgage arrears announced by Government in May 2015 included a number of amendments to the Mortgage to Rent Scheme which will enable more properties to qualify, and make it more flexible and accessible to borrowers. Amendments made with effect from July 2015 include raising the valuation thresholds for properties, flexibility in relation to the size of properties, more efficient assessment of a borrower&rsquo;s eligibility for social housing support and flexibility to allow cases of marginal positive equity to avail of the scheme. Additional financial support has been made available by increasing the ceiling of support under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) for MTR cases from 30% to 40%. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of both Mortgage to Rent schemes under review. </p></reply>

A number of important measures have been taken already aimed at improving housing viability and increasing supply, through the actions set out in Construction 2020 and the Social Housing Strategy 2020<i>. </i>The Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which commenced in September 2015, introduced a number of reforms in relation to, inter alia, Part V of the Planning and Development Acts; the retrospective application of reduced development contributions; and the introduction of a vacant site levy.</p><p>These measures were introduced to incentivise the development of vacant and underutilised sites for housing and regeneration purposes. Together, these legislative provisions are aimed at putting in place structural reforms of planning and land development processes that will support an increase in the output of housing to meet the needs of everyone in Ireland.</p><p>Given that these measures will take time to fully impact on supply, a comprehensive suite of shorter-term measures was put in place to improve the operation of the private rental sector and stimulate increased housing supply. Details of the full package of rent stability and housing supply measures, as set out in the document Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>I brought forward two major pieces of legislation to put the key elements of Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply on a statutory footing, namely:</p><p>- The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015, which strengthens the status of aspects of planning guidelines issued to local authorities on planning matters to ensure their consistent application, particularly in relation to Apartment Standard Guidelines. It also streamlines the process for the making of modifications to Strategic Development Zone planning schemes; and</p><p>- The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, which provides for an increased rent review period from one to two years , increased notice periods for rent reviews and greater protections for both tenants and landlords. These measures will bring much-needed stability to the rental sector pending the coming on-stream of the supply of new housing.</p><p>With regard to the supply of social housing, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 provides for clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list with flexibility to meet future demand. In total, 110,000 new social housing units are targeted for delivery with 35,000 new units to be delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies, and 75,000 households to be supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme. The Social Housing Strategy 2020 can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>The Social Housing Strategy 2020 and associated funding of &euro;1.7 billion under budgets 2015 and 2016 provided for the delivery of 13,000 social housing units in 2015, under a range of programmes, by local authorities and approved housing bodies. This represents an increase of 86% on the circa 7000 units delivered in 2014. The target for 2016 is again ambitious at 17,000 units.</p><p>Evidence that the Strategy is delivering can be found in the report, Social Housing Output in 2015, which I published on 26 January 2016. The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Moreover, the programme for rapid-delivery of 500 housing units for homeless families across Dublin continues to be implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless families accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements. </p></reply>

Under these arrangements, Threshold provides advice and advocacy for tenants who are at risk of losing their homes. When necessary, Threshold may refer the case directly to the Department of Social Protection and that Department may apply a discretionary uplift to Rent Supplement rates, thereby securing the continuation of the tenancy. </p>  <p>  While the protocol arrangements are currently only operational in Cork and Dublin, the Department of Social Protection continues to exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis for Rent Supplement clients nationwide under its National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under both Tenancy Sustainment arrangements, uplifts have been granted at the discretion of the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Welfare Officers to over 7,100 clients nationwide, with approximately 4,700 of these in the Dublin Region. Operational issues in this regard are a matter for the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with housing authorities and the Department of Social Protection to extend the Interim Tenancy Sustainment arrangements to certain local authority areas were the most severe rental market pressures have been noted &ndash; namely, Galway City Council and Kildare, Meath and Wicklow County Councils. Arrangements for the extension are well advanced and it should be formalised in the very near future. </p></reply>

To the end of December 2015, a total of 2,000 residential properties which are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired had been secured for social housing use . These comprise 1,426 completed properties and a further 574 that had been contracted and where completion work is on-going. A further 249 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going , and 341 other properties are to be further appraised for their suitability . Overall, I expect this initiative will result in over 2,200 units being made available for social housing purposes. These and other statistics are available on the website of the Housing Agency at .  In addition, within the context of its statutory independent commercial mandate, NAMA expects to be in a position to fund the construction of up to 20,000 new residential units, predominantly located in Dublin and the neighbouring counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath over the next five years. In line with residential planning and regulatory requirements, developments funded by NAMA are subject to policy relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. As such, I expect 10% of the output of this investment by NAMA, or roughly 2,000 units, to become available for social housing. It will also be open to local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to seek to purchase additional units , including blocks or groups of units, within these developments for social housing purposes, with the assistance of one of the capital or current funding programmes available from my Department and subject to the normal criteria for sustainable mixed tenure communities.</p><p>My Department will continue to work closely with NAMA to ensure that maximum social housing benefit is gained through NAMA activities. </p></reply>

It is important in such circumstances for creditors to bring any claims to the notice of the appointed liquidator without delay.  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and investigation under the Acts. </p>  <p>  While I appreciate the distressing situation that a homeowner has to deal with when faced with the consequences of the use of defective materials or poor workmanship, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the homeowner, the builder/developer and/or their respective insurers. Where a structural guarantee is in place, there may be obligations on the guarantee provider if the defects fall within the scope of the guarantee and are within the period of cover which may be up to 10 years. The Owner Management Company of a development may have a role in particular if other apartments in the development are affected. The homeowner may also wish to consider seeking the advice of a legal professional such as the law agent who acted on their behalf in connection with the purchase of the property.</p></reply>

Regulation 22(2) of the 2011 Regulations provides that this ineligibility does not apply where an applicant for social housing support owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. The rationale for this exception is that the terms of a formal separation or divorce will provide for the future ownership and occupation of the family home and it will be clear whether the household that has left the family home can return to live there. </p>  <p>  In order to provide more flexibility to housing authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 amended section 20 of the 2009 Act. Housing authorities may now provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Act amendment provides that support in these circumstances will be reviewed by the housing authority at prescribed intervals and the household will not be able to transfer to other forms of social housing support while ownership of the family home remains to be determined. However, where the household ultimately qualifies for the full range of social housing supports, the length of time the household was supported under RAS or HAP will be reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for a transfer. </p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. </p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services in the last four years, and is continuing to invest.  These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>On the 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State Intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment. The formal procurement commenced with the publication of the Project Information Memorandum and the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire. In addition, my Department also published:</p><p>- the National Intervention Strategy &ndash; updated in December 2015, which takes account of responses to the public consultation which took place in July 2015 and subsequent expert analysis; and</p><p>- the High Speed Broadband Map 2020 which follows ongoing engagement with industry and public consultation. </p><p>The Intervention strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps download and 6 Mbps upload. It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand. It is therefore a matter for bidders to select the technology which will show how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.</p><p>The 2020 map is available at .

The management of radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). ComReg is independent in the exercise of its functions.</p>  <p>  Licences issued by ComReg impose terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations. The design of the network is a matter entirely for the operator concerned although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons. ComReg monitors compliance with licence requirements by means of bi-annual drive tests. I understand that current testing is designed to cover all primary and secondary national routes, with measurements being performed on all Mobile Networks.</p>  <p>  Given that mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by several factors including topography, the capacity of the network, data demand, and the quality of mobile phone handsets. Difficulties for service providers in erecting masts and antennas due to planning issues can also impact negatively on the quality of coverage experienced by consumers, and Local Authorities can play a strong role in supporting the roll out of telecommunications infrastructure. </p>  <p>  In terms of improving the quality and coverage of mobile services in all areas throughout the country, there are various initiatives underway to achieve this aim.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2 bn in telecommunications infrastructure and services over the last four years, and are continuing to invest.  A further &euro;850 m has being invested in acquiring spectrum under the 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction run by ComReg. Since then, the mobile operators have all continued to invest in rolling out 4G and enhanced 3G services nationwide. These investments are improving both the coverage and quality of voice and data services throughout the country, although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are in progress. </p>  <p>  I am confident that with the continued significant investment being made by mobile operators, including the continued roll-out of 4G services, the quality of mobile services will continue to improve. </p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. The Department strongly welcomes and encourages ongoing commercial investment in high speed broadband services. </p><p>The EU State Aid Guidelines for Broadband require Member States to thoroughly evaluate any commercial plans so as to ensure that State Aid is confined to those areas where commercial investment in high speed broadband services is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.  </p><p>The Department has had extensive engagement with operators to identify those areas where there are concrete plans to roll out high speed broadband on a commercial basis.  Such areas will be excluded from the proposed State intervention.  In October 2015 the Department published the process it proposed to adopt in order to assess commercial high speed broadband investment plans.</p><p>Plans received from commercial operators were subsequently assessed under technical, deployment and financial criteria, in line with the EU State Aid requirements.  This resulted in the publication of the High Speed Broadband Map 2020 in December 2015. No additional commercial plans have been submitted since the 2020 map was launched in December 2015. </p><p>The Map is a critical aspect of EU State Aid compliance and the mapping process remains open, in accordance with terms that have been published on the Department's website () so that any new developments can be managed. </p><p>The Department will update the Map during procurement where a commercial plan is deemed to comply with the Department&rsquo;s assessment criteria and the operator signs the required Commitment Agreement. Any consequent changes to the areas requiring state investment will not require a change to the NBP intervention strategy but will serve to reduce the areas identified for state investment. Furthermore, where additional commercial developments occur, these should accelerate the roll-out of high speed broadband nationally.  </p><p>In delivering a combination of commercial and State-led investment in high speed broadband, the National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that 85% of all premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband by 2018, with 100% having access by 2020.</p></reply>

In those discussions, daa have noted their concern that the impact of some of the planning conditions would restrict operations across the entire airport at key times.  The development of an air cargo hub was not raised during those discussions.</p>  <p>  The restrictions on airport operations that are contained in the planning permission for the second runway appear to be for the purpose of noise management. New EU legislation in this area will enter into effect by 13 June this year - specifically EU Regulation 598/14 concerning noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports which requires the application of a balanced approach between stakeholders.  This regulation sets out the mandatory procedure to be followed when introducing operating restrictions at airports. </p>  <p>  Since 2002, there has been a number of EU Directives governing the environmental noise from transport sources, including major airports.  Specifically in relation to Dublin Airport, the implementation of the EU legislation involves this Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Environmental Protection Agency, Fingal County Council, Irish Aviation Authority and the daa.  The new noise regulation presents an opportunity to establish a modern cohesive and measured approach to the management of noise at Irish airports which is capable of delivering the best outcome for all stakeholders, including the communities referred to by the Deputy at Dublin Airport. </p>  <p>  My Department along with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government are now engaged in discussions on the best way forward to ensure the appropriate implementation of the Regulation by mid-June.</p></reply>

From a policy perspective, the requirement of proof of medical fitness for older drivers was introduced and has been maintained on safety grounds.  As deteriorations due to aging can have detrimental effects on driving skills, it has been deemed prudent to require medical certification of fitness to drive on a periodic basis for older drivers.  This is widespread international practice and has been the case in this jurisdiction since 1964. </p>  <p> Age-related conditions which may impair driving ability are not confined to eyesight, but cover a wide range.  This is why a certification of fitness is required from a general practitioner rather than an optician.</p>  <p>  Periodic medical testing of drivers helps to detect disease, as well as diminishing eyesight, in time.  This is all the more necessary as many drivers may not be aware of the deterioration of their driving skill.  Identification of deteriorations does not necessarily mean that drivers will not be able to renew their licences, as many deteriorations associated with age may be correctable with treatment.</p></reply>

The upgrade of the M50 was completed as recently as 2010 at a cost of &euro;1 billion and the extra capacity is under pressure already. In the short to medium term, the objective has to be to optimise the operation of the M50 and enhance other options, such as public transport.</p>  <p>  TII looked at a range of short-term and longer-term measures to manage demand and optimise operational efficiency on the M50, which it published in its M50 Demand Management Study in April 2014.  At my request, TII has undertaken further analysis and it is progressing several short-term measures. These include changes to junction layouts at key locations, following recent layout upgrades at the N3/M50 and Dublin Airport/M1. The aim of the revised layout is to optimise use of lanes to increase throughput.  TII and local authorities are erecting new, permanent, signage to direct traffic where diversions from the M50 are required. </p>  <p>  Looking forward, I have approved a proposal for TII to progress work on Variable Speed Limits on key areas of the M50, which would smooth out peak time traffic flows. With design and procurement, however, TII estimate this system would take around three years to deliver.  Improvements in terms of public transport alternatives include the reopening of the Phoenix Park Tunnel for services on the Kildare commuter rail line in 2016.  The new LUAS Cross City line, which will be in operation in late 2017, will also be of significant help in this regard. The Capital Plan also envisages significant ongoing investment in the replacement and enlargement of the PSO bus fleet.</p></reply>

The rationale for taxi regulation is to ensure that passengers have a safe vehicle for their journey, with appropriate insurance in place, driven by a driver who has been vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, in the case of taxis, with a pre-established and verified charging system. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government's policy is to ensure a high level of standards and professionalism in the industry for both the customer and the industry itself.</p>  <p>  My overall aim in relation to the taxi industry is to continue to strike the right balance between the interests and safety of consumers and having fair and transparent rules for taxi service providers. Compared to some other countries, Ireland's taxi and hackney market is very much an open market.  All services provided by small public service vehicles must fully meet the legal and licensing requirements of the National Transport Authority.</p>  <p>  Uber's existing services in Ireland fully meet the legal and licensing requirements of the National Transport Authority.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) provides funding for road and laneways that Councils have not taken in charge, that is, private roads and landways. The maintenance and improvement of these roads is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.   </p>  <p>  The LIS for regional and local roads remains in place but my Department does not provide a separate grant allocation towards this scheme.  Instead local authorities may use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to revise the current arrangement. I take the view that local authorities are best placed to assess whether funding should be allocated to LIS.</p></reply>

In a significant element of the judgement, the court found that Ireland had not designated sufficient special protection areas for the corncrake and in paragraphs 101-102 of the judgement referred specifically to the Falcarragh to M&iacute;n an Chladaigh area. This area had long had a substantial population of this species and therefore was required by the Court to be included in the special protection area network. However, the corncrake population has declined in recent years.    </p>  <p>  The intention to designate the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh special protection area was advertised in July 2011. Landowners were advised that they could appeal against the proposed designation of the site as a special protection area. The appeals process has two stages: a Departmental review of an objection to the proposed designation, after which landowners who receive an adverse review may opt to take their cases to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board. This is an independently chaired Board which makes recommendations to me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on such cases. </p>  <p>  While a number of appeals are before the Board relating to the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh special protection area, the appeal hearings had been adjourned by the Board. Subsequent to this adjournment I, along with Minister of State, Joe McHugh T.D., met with a group representing landowners from M&iacute;n an Chladaigh to discuss the issues arising. Officials of my Department have also met with the landowners on a number of occasions and with the Board. </p>  <p>  My officials are now working towards a draft management plan for the site, to be developed in full consultation with landowners and Donegal County Council. This will aim to address as much as possible the concerns of landowners regarding the special protection area while providing for restoration of the corncrake. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Board has recently informed appellants that it believes that the adjournment on appeals for this site should remain in place until this draft management plan is developed and presented by my Department. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to review the current designation of the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh special protection area. However, the final boundary of the site may be amended as a result of the appeals process. </p></reply>

The 1988 Canal Bye-Laws have been in force for some 27 years and need to be revised to reflect changes in the use of the canals over the intervening years. The proposed changes would allow Waterways Ireland to make new bye-laws to proactively manage the Royal and Grand Canals, as well as the Barrow Navigation.   </p>  <p>  The proposed amendments to the Canals Act 1986 were designed to provide for the regulation of the canals; the issue of permits or licences to regulate the use of boats on the canals and on canal property; the regulation of the type or class of boat which may be used on the canals; the regulation of berths and moorings and the placing of buoys on the canals or other canal property; the regulation and care of animals on the canals and other canal property; the appointment and powers of authorised officers and the service of directions.  </p>  <p>  Our waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad. With approximately 500 boats on the three systems, Waterways Ireland is seeking to encourage more visiting boats onto the waterways. However, the existing bye-law regime is not conducive to advancing this objective. The proposed legislative changes were intended to encourage tourism and leisure craft users by supporting the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals and by enhancing Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s ability to manage, maintain and develop the canals as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users.</p>  <p>  A decision on whether to proceed with the Heritage Bill 2015, which has passed Second Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, will fall to be made in due course.</p></reply>
