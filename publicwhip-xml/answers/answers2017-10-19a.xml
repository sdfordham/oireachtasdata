    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-19a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900057#WRA00600"><p>First of all let me say for the benefit of the Deputy that the Disclosures Tribunal was appointed following the passage of resolutions by this House and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 16 February 2017. Those resolutions require the Tribunal to report to the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with its findings and recommendations. Therefore, I do not propose to say or do anything which could be interpreted as impinging on its independence.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it is the Garda Commissioner who has statutory responsibility to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, the putting in place of internal structures to service the Tribunal is a matter for the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. I do not believe that it would be proper for me as Minister to prescribe the approach which is taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the Tribunal.  Indeed, I would be open to criticism if I were to seek to influence how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fulfil their duties to the Tribunal.  </p>  <p>  On a general note I would reiterate that the Government has been anxious to ensure that the Tribunal receives the greatest degree of assistance possible from all parties, not least An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. To that end the Government has been supportive of the former Commissioner, and continues to support the acting Commissioner in ensuring that the required resources are at the disposal of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to service the Tribunal in a timely and effective manner.  I am advised that the services of two retired senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were engaged initially for a period of six months and then for a further period of three months to 30 November 2017 in accordance with the formal sanction. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the work of these two retired members supports the Disclosure Tribunal Co-Ordination Office which is staffed by one full-time member, seconded temporarily from the Office of Corporate Communications. A number of additional personnel are also facilitating the work of this office on an ad hoc basis as requirements dictate.  I am further informed that liaison persons have been nominated from relevant sections/Regions to deal with specific requests from the Tribunal.  Funding for the Co-Ordination Office is met from within the Garda Vote.</p>  <p>  I would reiterate that the provision of these additional resources is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation is able to cooperate with the Tribunal to the fullest extent, without unduly affecting the ability of the organisation to continue to carry out its normal vital work. That said, there is nothing in the arrangements put in place by the Commissioner to prevent, nor could they, the right of any individual member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make any representations they see fit, relevant to its terms of reference, directly to the Tribunal. This includes any complaint by any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the arrangements in place for their representation at the Tribunal. Any matters relating to representation before the Tribunal will of course ultimately be decided by the Tribunal itself.  </p></reply>

The Minister for Justice and Equality found, on 30 May last, that in an international protection system with no temporal limits as to when the application process will be concluded, an absolute prohibition on the right to work for international protection applicants is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution.  The Court recognises that this is a matter for the Executive and Legislature to consider and accordingly has adjourned consideration of the Order the Court should make for a period of six months.</p>  <p>  Following the approval of Government, I established an Inter-Departmental Taskforce to examine the wide-ranging implications of the judgment, and to consider appropriate solutions.  The Taskforce is also examining the legal options available to the State to give effect to the judgment. </p>  <p>  My Department engages regularly with civil society and the NGO community on international protection and wider immigration matters. Staff also attend conferences organised by the NGO sector, including one specifically on the right to work question. Written submissions have also been received. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce is due to report back to Government very shortly in preparation for the State's response to the Court judgement.  In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me comment further in advance of the Taskforce completing its deliberations on the matter. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-19a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900057#WRA01600"><p>The Deputy will be aware that only last week I announced the additional resource allocations for the Justice sector in Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  A total budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018, an increase of 2% on 2017. It should be noted that the Garda allocation substantially continues to benefit from the significant additional funding that was provided in 2016, and maintained in 2017, to fund the sustained response to tackle gangland crime, fund the continuation of Operation Thor and ensure that measures to prevent international terrorism can be continued. </p>  <p>  Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2021. This major investment will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime and will facilitate progress on important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on Crime Investigation.</p>  <p>  Let there be no doubt, targeting organised crime is an on-going priority for the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is tackling such activity through a range of targeted measures designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. This involves targeting serious criminals and organised criminal groups on a number of fronts and across all geographical locations. This is achieved through the use of focused intelligence led operations by Garda specialist units, including the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the National Economic Crime Bureau and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations. When required, support from the Security and Intelligence Section is also available. These specialist units also work closely with the Criminal Assets Bureau in targeting persons involved in such criminality.  </p>  <p>  It can be seen therefore that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises multi-disciplinary approaches to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted. This includes the use of money-laundering legislation and the powers available to the Criminal Assets Bureau under the proceeds of crime legislation. In this regard, the Deputy might recall the new powers introduced under the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provides for Bureau Officers, subject to certain conditions, to immediately seize and detain property for a 24 hour period. Provision is also made for this period to be extended upon the authorisation of the Chief Bureau Officer, subject to certain conditions, for a further period not exceeding 21 days. In this context, the Act also lowered the thresholds applicable to seizures by reducing the value of property involved from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000. In addition, new regulations were made to reduce the prescribed amount of cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime which can be seized, from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  The legislative framework underpinning the State's response to organised crime is kept under constant review to ensure its on-going effectiveness and robustness. The recent strengthening of the proceeds of crime legislative framework to further support the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau is an example in this regard.  </p>  <p>  Having regard to the cross border aspect of organised crime, there is close and on-going co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, including combating organised crime. The two police forces operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island. All of these are important elements in enabling the two forces to work more effectively together in tackling crime and promoting community safety for all communities on this island. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to participate in joint and multi-disciplinary and multi-jurisdictional investigations, within the European Union and world-wide. Successful investigations, prosecutions and disruptions of criminal activities have been and continue to be achieved through these cross jurisdictional co-operative arrangements. In this regard, the Deputy might recall the very effective joint policing operation in 2016 involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Spanish colleagues. These types of operations demonstrate the determination of the Garda authorities and the Government to ensure that Irish criminals will not escape justice by fleeing this jurisdiction, or by seeking to conduct their criminal activities from abroad. They also demonstrate the on-going close liaison that the Force has with law enforcement agencies internationally.</p></reply>

The Act essentially provides that where a young person is responsible for committing a crime s/he shall be considered for admission to the Diversion Programme. In order for a young person to be admitted to the Programme s/he must take responsibility for their offending behaviour; agree to be cautioned by a Garda; and where appropriate agree to terms of supervision.</p>  <p>  The most recent figures available from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the number of young people admitted to the Programme are for 2015. 7,282 young people were admitted to the Programme in that year and 1,479 were deemed unsuitable for the Programme.</p>  <p>  The operation of the Diversion Programme is supported by the nationwide network of Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs). GYDPs are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in criminal and/or anti-social behaviour. There are 105 of these projects in place nationally and they are funded by my Department.  </p>  <p>  A committee to review the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme reports annually as provided in section 44(6) of the Children Act. In addition, a Group, established by the former Garda Commissioner, is undertaking a comprehensive review of the existing Youth Diversion Programme and its report is awaited.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Youth Diversion Programme is an important part of Government policy in relation to tackling youth crime and I am sure the Deputy will agree that we all want to see it operating effectively.</p></reply>

It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  All Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published in June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. </p>  <p>  These Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime. In addition, each Community Policing Team will be supported by a Community Safety Forum.  The Forum which will comprise of local Garda&iacute;, members of the public and community groups will promote crime prevention strategies.  This clear and consistent approach to community policing will ensure a better service and enhanced community safety.</p>  <p>  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed by the Commissioner that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams and Community Safety Fora will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Executive for implementation. The Commissioner anticpates that a number of Community Policing Teams will be established on a pilot basis early next year. </p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of Community Garda over the last seven years  is currently being complied and I will forward it directly to the Deputy when it is to hand.</p></reply>

One of the key measures in the legislation provides for Preliminary Drug Testing, which enables Garda&iacute; to test motorists at the roadside, whom they suspect of driving under the influence of drugs, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can now establish roadside checkpoints, known as Mandatory Impairment Checkpoints (MITs), to test drivers for the presence of both alcohol and drugs. </p>  <p>  The new drug testing devices (Dr&auml;ger DrugTest 5000) involve testing a sample of a driver&rsquo;s oral fluid (saliva) for the presence of cannabis, cocaine, opiates (e.g. heroin, morphine) and benzodiazepines (e.g. valium). The new devices will also be available in Garda stations. The MBRS has found that of the 3,020 specimens of blood and urine that it received in 2016, 24% confirmed positive for drugs other than alcohol. Of these, 91% were specimens from male drivers, most of whom were in the 17-44 year age range. Cannabis was the most prevalent drug detected, followed by benzodiazepines. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the MBRS went to tender for new preliminary breath testing equipment and it is hoped that all stages of the process will be completed by early 2018.  New equipment, which is available in the market place, has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath-tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically, reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data. </p>  <p>  To support the introduction of Preliminary Drug Testing, the Road Safety Authority ran a number of campaigns this year to raise awareness of the new Garda drug-testing powers. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that drug driving is a factor in approximately one in ten fatal crashers. Drug driving not only puts the driver at risk but also passengers and other road users. The introduction of Preliminary Drug Testing this year strengthens the ability of Garda&iacute; to tackle drug driving and I am committed to supporting this important statutory enforcement provision in my role as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

Family reunification entitlements for those granted International Protection in Ireland are governed by Sections 56 and 57 of the International Protection Act 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland committed to accept approximately 1,040 refugees by the end of 2017 under the resettlement strand of the Programme and this commitment is on track with 785 people already in the State and the remaining 270 people due in early 2018 from Lebanon. Furthermore, I announced on 15 September last that Ireland would pledge to accept 600 programme refugees in 2018. This commitment has been made as part of a new EU Commission and UNHCR resettlement pledging exercise under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, for the period 09 December 2017 &ndash; 31 December 2018. Since the conclusion of this pledging exercise, the Commission issued a Resettlement Recommendation on 27 September, which calls for the resettlement of 50,000 refugees between December of this year and the end of October 2019. Member States, like Ireland, who have already made pledges are being encouraged to consider increasing their pledges for the new two-year timeframe of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Under the Relocation Strand of the Programme, we will have admitted our full cohort from Greece (1,089) by early 2018. Relocation from Italy has not been possible within the two-year timeframe of the programme due to a refusal by Italy to allow law enforcement officers from other Member States to conduct security assessments of relocation candidates on its soil. Our efforts to resolve this issue are ongoing.</p>  <p>  I fully intend to honour our commitment under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. While the relocation strand has not yielded the expected numbers, together with my Department officials, I have been examining potential new pathways for people in need of protection following the conclusion of the EU programmes. One possibility is through a family reunification measure, for which I intend to bring forward fresh proposals in the near future. Such a programme would concentrate efforts on reunification of immediate family members specifically caught up in conflict zones, and would be in addition to those eligible under the provisions of the International Protection Act 2015. </p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon, and the balance through a variety of mechanisms.  Some elements of this intake, such as the relocation strand, come with a time limit of two years and other elements are not time limited.  </p>  <p>  As regards the resettlement strand of the Programme, Ireland had taken in 519 of the original commitment of 520 by the end of 2016 a year ahead of schedule.  Last year the Government doubled its commitment under resettlement to 1,040 and the total to have arrived from Lebanon under refugee resettlement now stands at 785.  The remaining 255 persons to arrive under resettlement have been selected and assessed and are expected to arrive in early 2018 together with an additional 15 persons composed of new born babies and additional family members giving a total of 270.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the relocation aspect of the IRPP, allocations under the relevant EU Council Decisions are composed of three elements:</p>  <p>  - an intake from Greece of 1,089 asylum seekers</p>  <p>  - an intake from Italy of 623 asylum seekers and</p>  <p>  - an allocation of 910 asylum seekers which has not yet been assigned to either Italy or Greece. </p>  <p>  Ireland will meet in full its commitment to Greece.  621 of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State and a further 390 have been assessed and are awaiting transportation.   All will arrive in 2017 or early 2018. </p>  <p>  However, Italy, unlike Greece, did  not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory. Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments on its territory of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland.  It has therefore not been possible for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy despite the most intensive efforts by Ireland to resolve the impasse, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level.</p>  <p>  In terms of the unallocated portion contained in the two EU Council Decisions referred to above, which in the case of Ireland amounts to  910 persons,  Ireland could not access this component until a decision was taken at EU level to allocate these numbers as between Greece and Italy.  Given that it is now clear the numbers of persons covered by the two  Relocation Decisions do not actually exist on the ground in Greece or Italy, it is not foreseen that this number will ever be allocated to Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ireland has worked actively to give effect to the EU relocation Decisions. But the relocation instruments are unlikely to deliver the numbers allocated to Ireland  for the reasons set out above.  What I can unambiguously state is that the commitment by Ireland to accept 4,000 persons remains and Ireland will fill any gaps arising from the relocation instruments using other mechanisms such as pledges for programme refugees.  This process is already underway and on 15 September 2017 I made a new Pledge to the European Commission to take a further 345 Programme Refugees. I am also examining other options.</p></reply>

The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this  Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Cavan/Monaghan Division on the 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 323. There are also 12 Garda Reserves and 37 civilians attached to the Cavan/Monaghan Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.   </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 33 of whom have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda&iacute; are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p>  <p>  In so far as cross-border matters are concerned, there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combatting security threats and tackling cross-border crime. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island. </p>  <p>  Both Governments have publicly declared their commitment to ensuring no return to a so-called 'hard border' on the island of Ireland and it is the firm intention that in the context of the UK's departure from the European Union there will be no diminution in the level of co-operation in this regard, and every effort will continue to be made to achieve that outcome.</p></reply>

The contract for the safety camera service, which was awarded following a public procurement competition, is with Road Safety Operations Ireland, trading as GoSafe.  The new safety camera contract is an agreement between the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Road Safety Operations Ireland, trading as GoSafe. The Minister for Justice and Equality authorised the awarding of the services agreement for the provision and operation of safety cameras on a managed service basis for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in accordance with Section 81(7) of the Road Traffic Act, 2010.</p>  <p>  The previous safety camera contract, also with GoSafe, expired on the date services were commenced under the current contract, which was 1 May 2017. The duration of the current contract is 6 years with effect from the Services Commencement Date, with the option to extend the contract for an additional 12 months. The estimated cost of the core safety camera service over 6 years is approximately 73 million EUR excluding VAT (Total cost of the safety camera contract over 7 years is estimated at &euro;100.4 million EUR, including VAT). </p>  <p>  Under the current contract, GoSafe will provide an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying vehicle speed across 1,031 designated safety camera zones. This equates to a minimum of 7,400 monitoring hours and 100 survey hours a month. This represents an annual increase of 300 hours on the existing contract.  The current contract also contains provisions for up to 1,500 additional monitoring hours within any calendar month and the option to avail of fixed, temporary fixed and average speed safety camera systems.</p>  <p>  The role of the Safety Camera Contract is critical in the context of road traffic enforcement, improving road safety by changing driver behaviour in order to reduce road traffic fatalities and serious injuries by reducing the incidence of drivers exceeding stipulated speed limits, in circumstances where speeding is known to be a significant factor behind serious collisions. As such, the deployment of safety cameras is determined by road safety considerations as opposed to revenue maximisation. </p>  <p>  The overall impact of the cameras can be seen in the impact on the fatal collisions in the designated safety camera zones, referred to as speed enforcement zones. The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  In the years 2004 to 2009 (the 6 years before the introduction of the safety camera network began), approximately 3 out of 10 (30%) fatal collisions occurred in these zones. In 2015, this figure had reduced to 16% (or 24 road deaths) in safety camera zones.</p>  <p>  In relation to the role of GoSafe staff in Court cases, it should be noted that GoSafe do not prosecute any cases. They are witnesses for the prosecution, rather than theprosecuting agency. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prosecute speeding cases at District Court level. In addition, GoSafe operators receive formal training from GoSafe in relation to court attendance. While there are no plans currently to further strengthen the role of the company's staff in these cases, my Department will continue to consult closely with both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in relation to this road traffic enforcement matter. </p>  <p>  My Department is in ongoing contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport via a number of different fora in relation to road traffic enforcement matters. My Department also closely monitors all changes to road traffic legislation, the responsibility for which rests with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Shane Ross, T.D. </p></reply>

It follows from the Interim Audit Report prepared by the Garda Internal Audit Section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and published by the Garda Commissioner last March. The PAC report makes a number of findings and recommendations in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department. Those findings and recommendations are being carefully examined with a view to identifying what follow up is appropriate. </p>  <p>  In relation to findings concerning my Department and, in particular, in relation to its oversight of financial matters within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, these findings are being examined to determine whether any enhancements are required to existing oversight arrangements within the parameters of the statutory framework set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  It is important, however, to recall that under the Act it is the Garda Commissioner who is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and is in law responsible for ensuring that the appropriate controls apply to expenditure within the organisation. Similar to all accounting officers, the Commissioner is responsible for the preparation of an annual Appropriation Account, which is then audited and reported on, by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his annual report each year. </p>  <p>  That said the fact that the Garda Commissioner is in law the Accounting Officer does not, of course, relieve my Department of its oversight role in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Indeed, new structures were put in place in recent years to strengthen oversight with the introduction of a formal governance agreement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2015. The Governance Framework Agreement makes provision, amongst other things, for regular governance meetings between the Secretary General of my Department and the Commissioner as well as tripartite meetings involving my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Authority. </p>  <p>  A new Governance Framework Agreement is in the process of being drawn up by my Department in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, having regard to the revised 2016 edition of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. This new Agreement is expected to be concluded by end 2017.  A communications protocol between the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also being developed as part of this process. This work will be informed by the findings and recommendations of the PAC Report.  A formal response will in the normal course to the Committee from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this  Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cork City Division, in the coming years.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Cork City Division on the 31 August 2017 was 656. There are also 44 Garda Reserves and 64 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 32 of whom have been assigned to the Cork City Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the table, as provided by the Commissioner, the number of Garda&iacute; allocated to each Garda station in the Cork City Division as of 31 August 2017 the latest date for which figures are readily available. </p><p><b>CORK CITY DIVISION 31 AUGUST 2017</b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT</th><th>STATION </th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>ANGLESEA   STREET</td><td>ANGLESEA   STREET</td><td>287</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLACKROCK</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BRIDEWELL</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>337</td></tr><tr><td>GURRANABRAHER</td><td>BALLINCOLLIG</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLARNEY</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIG   NA BHFEAR</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GURRANABRAHER</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>MAYFIELD</td><td>GLANMIRE</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MAYFIELD</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WATERCOURSE   ROAD</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>TOGHER</td><td>BISHOPSTOWN</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIGALINE</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CROSSHAVEN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DOUGLAS</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PASSAGE   WEST</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOGHER</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY TOTAL</td><td>16 STATIONS</td><td>656</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State;  2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, 1,040 programme refugees (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017 and early 2018) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme (currently focused on resettling refugees from Lebanon) with the balance arriving through a variety of mechanisms. A recent commitment was made to take in a further 345 programme refugees in 2018 and the possibility of a further pledge is being examined.</p>  <p>  The IRPP endeavours to the greatest extent possible to treat families and individuals in a broadly equivalent manner so as to commence the integration process in the quickest possible time scale. The IRPP does this as the likelihood of persons in the relocation cohort achieving a grant of international protection is very high because: (a) the selection process embedded in the relocation instruments is predicated on the fact that eligible nationalities must, across the EU, have a 75% or higher chance of obtaining status and (b) the overwhelming majority of persons being relocated to Ireland are fleeing the war in Syria and obtain refugee status. </p>  <p>  Before they arrive in Ireland, programme refugees and asylum seekers are interviewed abroad by Department officials to assess their needs and vulnerabilities and to initially orient them to Irish life and society.  Following their arrival in Ireland, and during their initial period of reception, they are accommodated in an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC).  As the name suggests, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently settled around the country. In the EROCs both cohorts receive broadly the same integration services with due account being taken of the fact that certain things may not be able to happen until individuals receive a decision on their application for a grant of international protection. IRPP staff hold regular clinics in the EROCs, often at weekly intervals, at which individuals and families may discuss their needs and requirements. The client group also receive an orientation and language training programme while in the EROC.  </p>  <p>  Some of the key features of supports provided to persons under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme include:</p>  <p>  - IRPP staff and interpreters, along with representatives of the Irish Red Cross, meet families and individuals upon arrival at Dublin Airport and accompany them to their accommodation in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre.</p>  <p>  - During the days following arrival in Ireland the asylum seekers are registered with the Department of Social Protection for a public services card and receive an exceptional needs payment (ENP).</p>  <p>  - IRPP officials provide assistance to ensure that families and individuals receive a medical card.</p>  <p>  - IRPP liaise with the local Education and Training Board in each catchment area to ensure that groups receive a Language Training and Cultural Orientation programme.</p>  <p>  - Local Service Providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres to provide services and information and to support and befriend the refugees.</p>  <p>  - A GP is assigned to the individuals and families to ensure that that their immediate medical needs are met including referral to dental and optical services.</p>  <p>  - Free Childcare is provided wherever possible to allow the adults to attend the Language and Orientation programme in their EROC.</p>  <p>  - Education provision is made for school age children by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  - Emergency medical matters are followed up while resident in the EROCs.</p>  <p>  - Once the asylum seekers receive refugee status and when housing is made available with the support of the Local Authority, the refugees will be resettled in the community with the support of the IRPP and volunteers in the local community. Each family has the support of an assigned IRPP resettlement worker to assist with the transition along with the support of a full-time Resettlement Support Worker and an Intercultural Support Worker. Local authorities also receive funding to provide counselling, transport and other supports.</p>  <p>  The IRPP integration model for relocated asylum seekers will work with existing best practice in this area as pioneered by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) but is also willing to work organically with community bodies, NGOs and civil society to see what else can be added to the integration model in order to help refugees </p>  <p>  It is my firm intention that the model of integration and support is one which will evolve and develop over the coming months and years with a view to offering refugees increasing opportunities to enhance their own lives and it is for this reason I am examining initiatives such as community sponsorship to support the long-term integration process. </p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister. </p></reply>

A key role of the  Operational Support Group is to support governors in implementing Government policy, including the prevention of the smuggling of contraband (including drugs) into prisons, the detection and prevention of illegal activity within the prison Estate and intelligence-gathering.  A further initiative of the  Operational Support Group was to introduce a confidential telephone line which allows prisoners and members of the public to alert prison authorities to activities surrounding the smuggling of drugs into prisons and the use of them therein. This confidential telephone line has assisted prison management in thwarting many attempts to smuggle drugs into prisons.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Irish Prison Service that any prisoner who enters the custody of the Irish Prison Services while presenting with addiction issues has access to addiction services, and is actively encouraged to engage with those services. </p>  <p>  The treatments available are based on the principles of best practice, and are similar to those available in the community setting.  This includes access to harm reduction methods, detoxification, stabilisation, and opiate replacement therapies.  These interventions are based on a multi-professional approach to ensure that the prisoners motivation, commitment and likelihood of success are always at the centre of planned care. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has advised that the healthcare team which delivers these treatments include, inter alia, GP Specialist Addiction services, Consultant Addiction psychiatrist, specialist addiction nurses, addiction counsellors, addiction links workers, pharmacists, primary care GP's, and prison nurses.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service also works very closely with the Probation Service, community, voluntary, and statutory agencies to maintain a pathway of care ensuring supports remain in place for prisoners on their release from custody.</p>  <p>  All prisoners have access to group and individual counselling services where they can address their own personal requirements, and specific support arrangements can be put in place and implemented during the prisoners period in custody. The prisoner can also benefit from peer support groups, music therapy, and a 9 week psycho-social based programme similar to community residential treatment services, which assists the person in remaining drug free.</p></reply>

Its third progress report which I published on 14 September identifies welcome progress in a number of areas including - </p>  <p>  - Significant progress in the work of the Garda Victims' Services Offices. </p>  <p>  - The establishment of four Protective Services Units on a pilot basis, </p>  <p>  - The completion of the Garda Deployment Survey</p>  <p>  - Positive progress in the development and implementation of the Divisional/functional model of policing </p>  <p>  - Progress on ICT projects, </p>  <p>  - The Executive Director of Strategy and Transformation has taken up his post, </p>  <p>  - Good progress on the implementation of improved risk management.</p>  <p>  As the report makes clear, while there has been progress significant improvements are required in respect of the pace of implementation.  </p>  <p>  I have made it clear that implementation of the ambitious reform programme must continue and, indeed, must move at a greater pace, to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland. To support An Garda  S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the concerns highlighted by the Authority a structured process of engagement is in place between my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and agree corrective actions. This engagement includes formal monthly meetings at senior official level with the Deputy Commissioner for Strategy and Governance, the Chief Administrative Officer and the newly appointed Executive Director of Strategy and Transformation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Report highlights the critical importance of the Policing Authority's role in delivering the full implementation of the reform agenda. It brings a capacity to engage intensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and maintain a sustained focus on what is actually being done and what is being achieved on the ground. Its reports reflect this rigorous approach and provide a very solid basis for engagement between my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the programme. </p>  <p>  I believe the only way to deliver world class policing in Ireland is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs and that those resources operate in an organisation whose culture is open and responsive and where the best management systems and practices are deployed.  I am confident that the reform plan that is being pursued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by the Government and overseen by the Policing Authority, has the capacity to achieve this.  It will not be done overnight but as I have made clear, the implementation of the ambitious reform programme must continue and, indeed, must move at a greater pace, to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland.</p></reply>

Any such proposals could give rise to any number of unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  In particularly, there may well be significant implications for the operation of the Common Travel Area, in the context of Britain withdrawing from the European Union.  Any proposal in this regard would have to be very carefully considered.</p><p>In addition, at the European level, Ireland together with the other Member States of the European Union, has committed under the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum agreed at the European Council in October 2008 &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment remains opposed to any form of general regularisation of those illegally present in Member States.  Member States commitment to this type of approach  has held steadfast despite the unprecedented movement of persons through the Mediterranean towards the European Union during recent years.  The Common European Asylum System continues to operate on a case by case basis and the Hot Spots in Greece and Italy operate a case management approach to the identification and registration of migrants and to establish those who are in need of international protection. </p><p>The position of  Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.</p><p>Ireland operates a very open immigration regime with many legal pathways open to non-EEA nationals to enter and reside in the State lawfully. The Deputy will appreciate that, in most cases, a person becomes undocumented through their own actions either by entering the state illegally in the first place or by deciding not to leave the State when they no longer have a valid immigration permission.<b></b>Such persons are always free to present their case, on its own merits, to the immigration authorities and it is reasonable for the State to expect that the persons concerned would respect the final decision.</p><p>However, in the context of the Report on Immigration, Asylum and the Refugee Crisis published by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality on 29 June 2017 I have asked officials from my Department to examine if any of the recommendations could be acted on further.  I am happy to act upon any proposals brought forward in this context subject to the important public policy considerations and international obligations outlined above.</p></reply>

The Act essentially provides that a young person who is responsible for committing a crime shall be considered for admission to the Programme.

Where an individual is deemed unsuitable for admission to the programme a prosecution may be pursued, although there may not be sufficient evidence for a prosecution in all such cases.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Kildare Division, in the coming years.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division on31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 343. There are also 20 Garda Reserves and 30 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 72 of whom have been assigned to the Kildare District.In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>I am, of course, conscious of the impact which anti-social behaviour and the types of crime referred to have on the quality of life for residents in local communities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks to provide assurance to communities affected by anti-social behaviour through high visibility policing and using proven evidence based interventions including hot-spot patrolling and targeted local and national interventions.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the table, as provided by the Commissioner, the number of Garda&iacute; allocated to each Garda station in the Kildare District as of 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available. </p><p><b>Garda Strength Kildare by Station</b><table><tr><th>District</th><th>Station</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>ATHY</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEDERMOT</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILDARE</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONASTEREVIN</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWBRIDGE</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHANGAN</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILDARE                 Total</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><td>LEIXLIP</td><td>CARBURY</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CELBRIDGE</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILCOCK</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LEIXLIP</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MAYNOOTH</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LEIXLIP                 Total</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>NAAS</td><td>CLANE</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILCULLEN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NAAS</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROBERTSTOWN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NAAS                    Total</td><td>122</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE  Total</td><td></td><td>343</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Therefore, Ireland (along with the UK) is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.</p>  <p>  ETIAS is one of several measures being implemented by the EU to modernise border controls, enhance public security and facilitate legitimate travel within a Europe without internal frontiers.</p>  <p>  Currently, there is no advance information as regards visa-exempt visitors coming to the Schengen external border. The number of visa exempt travellers to the Schengen countries will continue to grow, with an expected increase to 39 million by 2020. ETIAS is seen as necessary to strengthen the EU's capability to assess the potential migration and security risk represented by the increasing numbers of visa-exempt travellers.</p>  <p>  ETIAS will be an automated ICT system created to identify any risks associated with a visa-exempt visitor travelling to the Schengen Area. All visa-exempt third-country nationals who plan to travel to the Schengen area will be required to apply for travel authorisation through the system prior to their trip. The information gathered via the system will allow for early checks against relevant databases, before travellers arrive at the external border.</p>  <p>  The presence of a valid travel authorisation will give the border official a reliable indication that the person in front of them is likely to be a bona fide traveller. The process will be simple, inexpensive, fast and does not require a visit to a consulate. It will give travellers an early indication of their admissibility into the Schengen area.</p>  <p>  The ETIAS proposal has regard to the issues of fundamental rights and contains appropriate safeguards in relation to the protection and sharing of personal data. Article 12 of the Regulation relates to non-discrimination and requires that processing of personal data within the ETIAS shall be non-discriminatory, notably on the grounds of sex, race, or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The system&rsquo;s operation is required to fully respect human dignity and integrity.</p>  <p>  Notably, a decision to refuse entry will not be taken by the ETIAS system, but by a national border officer, following a review of the information submitted and relevant systems and databases. If necessary, additional information may be sought from the applicant.</p>  <p>  The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) has been consulted on the proposal. FRA delivered an opinion to the European Parliament on 3 July 2017 in relation to strengthening the protection of fundamental rights as affected by the Regulation. This opinion will be considered during ongoing discussions on the proposed legislation.</p></reply>

This year, the theme of the day is &ldquo;Transformation towards sustainable and resilient society for all&rdquo; and in this context I have progressed a range of initiatives.<s></s></p><p>In July of this year, I launched the new National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2021. This is an all of Government Strategy which is aimed at significantly improving the lives of people with disabilities in a practical sense, and also in creating the best possible opportunities for people with disabilities to fulfil their potential. I think it is a valuable step forward in the lives of people with disabilities in Ireland. It contains 114 actions, which have been developed to have the maximum beneficial impact for people who have disabilities. A significant number of these actions have the capacity to significantly impact on the way in which services support people with disabilities, and will, when fully implemented, have the potential to transform people&rsquo;s lives. One of these key actions is the examination of the recommendations of the report of the Personalised Budgets Task Force. The Task Force will report to me before the end of the year.</p><p>The National Disability Inclusion Strategy also contains significant commitments to support the Deaf Community. These include extension of the Irish Sign Language remote interpretation service and the resourcing of interpreters and the establishment of a quality-assurance and registration scheme for interpreters, for which I have, as already announced, secured funding via the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I was delighted to support the passage of the <i>Recognition of Irish Sign Language Bill 2016 </i>through Report Stage in the Seanad on 17 October. The Bill contains provisions relating to the obligations of public bodies in relation to Irish Sign Language, and the education of deaf children.  I have also secured funding in principle for a scheme to provide interpretation for users of ISL for social and cultural services, the details of which are being worked out at present.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be enacted and signed into law by the President before the end of the year. </p><p>Other significant developments since my appointment as Minister for Disability seventeen months ago include:  </p><p>- Launch of the Make Work Pay Report (April 2017); many of the recommendations in the report are already being implemented. </p><p>- Provision of medical cards for nearly 10,000 children in receipt of Domiciliary Care Allowance.</p><p>- Increase of 4.4% in funding for Disability Services in Budget 2018, bringing the annual total to &euro;1,763,000,000</p><p>In addition to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, there is also a ten year Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place, the entire focus of which is to ensure that people with disabilities, who are able to, and want to, work are supported and enabled to do so. The key purpose of the Strategy is to ensure that there is a concerted, cross-government effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities. As part of this effort, we will increase the public sector employment target of persons with disabilities from 3% to 6%. An implementation group comprising relevant government departments and stakeholders meets regularly, to ensure that the commitments outlined in the Strategy are being progressed. The Strategy is coordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality.  </p><p>One of the intentions of the United Nations International Disability Day is to increase awareness of disability issues. The National Disability Authority in cooperation with the Department of Justice and Equality operates an annual Disability Awareness Grant Scheme. The objective of the scheme is to support the promotion of positive attitudes towards persons with disabilities which has been one of my main focuses of attention since being appointed Minister. The 2017 scheme supports a Primary Schools Art Competition, the aim of which is to develop children&rsquo;s understanding of disabilities and to help them celebrate the aspects that make them and their classmates unique. Furthermore, in 2017 grants were awarded to six organisations that will be implementing awareness raising projects in community, sporting and social activities.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the President of the High Court and the presiding judge who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that there are 92 judgments outstanding for more than 3 months in the High Court. Of that figure, 10 are outstanding for more than 1 year and a further 3 are outstanding for more than 2 years. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate it is preferable, for the purposes of legal certainty, to have judgments delivered as quickly as possible. The Courts Service has advised, however, that the time taken to deliver a judgment from the date it is reserved varies from case to case and may depend on a number of factors including the complexity or duration of the case, the workload of an individual judge or the matter may be awaiting a determination from another court such as the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court or the European Court of Justice.

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public.  In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division as appropriate. </p>  <p>  I can say, however, that this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this  Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.</p></reply>

We are agreed that it is crucial that a deliberate and considered recruitment process takes place so that the best possible candidate is appointed following a selection process. We are also agreed that an overly long delay in the appointment of a new Commissioner would not be optimal for the organisation in terms of performance and morale.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the Authority has commenced the groundwork for the recruitment process in advance of the formal triggering of the statutory process by Government. I see this process taking a number of weeks during which the Authority will engage with my Department and with the Public Appointments Service which will undertake the competition on behalf of the Authority. Importantly, it will also allow the Authority to explore with the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland how it sees the future role and responsibilities of the new Commissioner. As the Deputy is aware the Commission is undertaking a comprehensive review of all aspects of policing in the State and has considerable experience and expertise. I very much welcome the willingness of the Commission to share its perspective with the Authority in advance of completing its work in September 2018. This will assist in ensuring that potential candidates have as much information as possible in relation to the future direction of policing in the State. </p>  <p>  Subject to the progress that the Authority makes over the coming weeks I would expect that the Government will be in a position to formally approve the Authority to invite the Public Appointments Service to conduct the selection process in early December.

The background to it is that prior to 1 October 1976, where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resigned or was dismissed before reaching the age and service at which he could retire on pension, that member forfeited all superannuation benefits under the then Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Superannuation Scheme. This situation was changed following discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council, the industrial relations machinery for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It was agreed at that time by both sides, the official side and the Garda representative associations and endorsed by the then Minister for Finance, that the new arrangements should apply to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serving on, or after, 1 October 1976. By extension, these new terms did not and cannot apply to members who had left An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to that date. Generally speaking, these Agreed Reports provide that a Garda who resigned or was dismissed on or after 1 October 1976 can have superannuation benefits accrued to the date of resignation or dismissal, preserved until the member reached 60 years of age.   </p>  <p>  The then Department of Finance, and now Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), which continues to have overall responsibility for public service pension matters, agreed with the proposals for a cut-off date for eligibility for preserved benefits. This date varies depending on the particular organisation involved and the conclusion of negotiations between management and the relevant staff interests.  </p>  <p>  I must stress that this was an agreed date between all of the parties involved in the discussions and was not imposed. It is an inevitable consequence of the introduction of improvements in pension schemes that members of that scheme who had left it prior to the effective date cannot avail of that benefit. </p>  <p>  As previously advised my Department has consulted the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and has been advised that the position remains that it is not possible to resolve a case individually on an administrative basis and provide an individual with preserved benefits without changing the terms of the scheme retrospectively. Such amendment would, in equity, have to cover all public servants who resigned prior to the effective date applicable to their schemes.  That Department has further stated that changing the various schemes to change the cut-off date is not a practicable proposition. There are no proposals to backdate the existing dates for the introduction of the preservation of superannuation benefits.   </p>  <p>  I am informed that the apparent exception referred to by the Deputy is a Garda who retired with full service prior to 1976 in the ordinary manner. The question of the treatment of that person creating a precedent does not apply. </p></reply>

This follows the Government's approval in July 2016 of a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the Government&rsquo;s response to the Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government aimed at increasing the visibility, effectiveness and responsiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The key structural change under the Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan is the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis, subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in both urban and rural areas. </p>  <p>  The Divisional model is being rolled out on a phased basis starting with a pilot programme. The four Divisions of DMR South Central, Cork City, Galway and Mayo have been selected for the pilot in order to provide a mix of urban and rural policing environments. This new model  will support the more flexible and effective deployment of Garda resources.</p>  <p>  The Policing Authority&rsquo;s latest progress report on the reform programme indicates positive progress has been made in the development and implementation of the Divisional/functional model of policing and it is continuing to monitor progress in relation to the pilots, in particular any learnings which could be applied in advance of the national rollout. The Authority has also indicated that it would like to see this project progressed more rapidly.</p>  <p>  I believe the only way to deliver world class policing in Ireland is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs and that those resources operate in an organisation whose culture is open and responsive and where the best management systems and practices are deployed.  I am confident that the reform plan, including the development of a functional model of policing that is being pursued by An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, supported by the Government and overseen by the Policing Authority, has the capacity to achieve this.  It will not be done overnight but as I have made clear, the implementation of the ambitious reform programme, including the implementation of the Divisional model, must continue and, indeed, must move at a greater pace, to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland.</p></reply>

Section 10 of that Act, which refers to the functions of the CCPC, states at subsection (8) that &ldquo;Nothing in this section or any other provision of this Act imposes a duty on the Commission to consider whether to investigate a matter that is referred to it but the Commission may, in the case of a matter referred to it, consider whether to do so (and, accordingly, may proceed to investigate the matter) where it is satisfied the matter may affect competition or the interests and welfare of consumers or both.&rdquo; I, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, have no direct function in relation to such matters. </p>  <p>  The CCPC&rsquo;s Annual Reports contain details regarding the contacts made to it each year.</p></reply>

In 2015, the request was for 16 additional personnel. In 2016, it requested 6 additional personnel and to date this year, it has requested 1 additional staff member. These figures do not include requests for backfilling of vacancies due to resignations, promotions, transfers, retirement etc. and neither does it refer to any request for the reconfiguration of grades in that Agency.  </p><p>The requests for additional staff in 2015 and 2016 were considered in the context of the overall Departmental vote allocation and were not sanctioned. However, iwithin its current pay budget. It has received approval to fill any vacancy that has arisen since then that it has wished to bn July 2015, the CCPC was given approval by the Department under the Staffing Resource Management Framework to fill 25 vacant posts subject to the CCPC remaining e filled. The 2017 request for 1 additional staff member was also sanctioned.</p><p>Regarding its financial resources, the CCPC&rsquo;s allocation is divided between &ldquo;General Administration&rdquo; and &ldquo;Financial Information and Education Functions&rdquo; expenditure. The first element covers the general administration and expenses of the CCPC in relation to the exercise of its statutory functions, except for its financial information and education functions and these expenses are funded through an exchequer grant each year. The second element is funded by a levy imposed on regulated financial service providers. As the levy is not collected until after mid-year, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation prefunds the expenditure by the CCPC on these functions, on the proviso that the Department is reimbursed by way of Appropriations-in-Aid before year end. It is therefore exchequer neutral. The CCPC&rsquo;s combined allocations since 2015 are set out in the table.<table><tr><th></th><th>Allocation (Exchequer and Levy)<br /><br />&rsquo;000s </th><th>Outturn<br /><br />&rsquo;000s </th></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>12,230 </td><td>9,124 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>12,141 </td><td>9,181 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>12,138 </td><td>N/A </td></tr></table></p><p>Aside from the costs that would have been associated with the request for the additional 16 personnel in 2015, the CCPC did not request any additional financial resources that year. On one occasion in August 2016, it requested an extra &euro;2.040m proposing to cover, amongst other matters, once off expenses arising from its planned move to new offices and the costs associated with its requests for additional personnel. In July 2017, it requested an extra &euro;235,000 to cover new projects.  </p><p>Due a variety of reasons, the CCPC&rsquo;s expenditure for 2015 and 2016 was under the monies allocated to it and so its request for extra financial resources in 2016 was not granted. Its request in 2017 has been approved.  </p><p>The CCPC&rsquo;s requests for additional financial resources have to be managed in the context of the overall Departmental Vote allocation and bearing this in mind, I consider the CCPC to be adequately resourced.</p></reply>

In so doing, it is required to apply any changes to tax or USC rates as passed by the Oireachtas. The question of Revenue applying rates other than those set out in statute does not therefore arise.</p>  <p>  On the topic of ring-fencing tax receipts, from a budgetary perspective any move to hypothecate revenue from a particular source should in general be avoided. As this involves linking specific expenditure to an explicit revenue source, it is only used in limited circumstances where a strong justification exists as it can cause difficulties for the efficient and effective management of the public finances. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it also exposes specific expenditure solely dependent on a hypothecated revenue to any potential volatility associated with this revenue source. Therefore, a more stable and sustainable financing model is to fund expenditure centrally, which instead relies upon a number of sources of income and retains the flexibility to address changing spending priorities or revenue issues as they arise.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the State's shareholdings in the banks, I must ensure the banks are run on a commercial and independent basis to protect their value as an asset to the State.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, much of the information requested by the Deputy is not held within my Department. I would also suggest that the information requested is commercially sensitive, and I would not expect commercial organisations to publicly disclose information that would give advance notice to the market of their operational or strategic intentions. </p><p>To my knowledge, the banks in which the State is a shareholder are not in the practice of disposing of performing assets, and so I would expect any future disposals to be non-performing loans. As the Deputy will know, non-performing loans remain at an elevated level across the European banking system and addressing this issue is one of the key priorities for the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).</p><p>In Ireland, significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of non-performing loans since the financial crisis. Despite this progress, the level of such loans in here remains well above the European average. Hence, the SSM has tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge. This challenge will have to be met irrespective of whether the State has a shareholding in the bank concerned or not.</p><p>In recent years Irish banks have introduced multiple engagement channels to facilitate those customers who are reluctant to engage directly with them. Having exhausted these initiatives, if meaningful engagement is not forthcoming from particular customers the bank may be left with no option but to look at alternative solutions which could, as a last resort, include the sale of the loan.</p><p>I have received the following comments on the Deputy's question.</p><p><b>AIB:</b></p><p>&quot;Since 2013, AIB has reduced impaired loans from c. &euro;30bn to &euro;7.8bn at 30th June 2017, the vast majority, through case by case restructuring of personal and business customers in difficulty. AIB continues to have high levels of NPLs versus its European peers and has developed plans to reduce these levels over the medium term to address this risk and also to meet its regulatory requirements. In April 2017, AIB entered into a binding contractual agreement to sell an investment portfolio of impaired Buy-to-Let originated mortgage loans with a value of c.&euro;200m.The majority of these loans are in deep long term arrears. A portfolio of UK based impaired unsecured loans was also sold in May 2017. The Bank continues its focus on supporting our customers in financial difficulty by actively implementing sustainable solutions to keep viable businesses operating and customers who engage with us in their homes where possible.</p><p>For commercial reasons the bank is unable to outline any specific details or plans at this stage.&quot;</p><p><b>PTSB:</b></p><p>&ldquo;The Bank is in the process of appointing an advisor to assess and assist on potential loan sales.

The interest rates charged on loans advanced by the Agency typically comprise a margin over Euribor. Some facilities are by reference to the margin NAMA inherited from the participating institution. Typically however, the margin is determined by reference to the risk characteristics of each individual project, including the funding term, the equity contribution of the debtor and the loan-to-value. With due regard to the unique risk profile of each credit facility, I am advised that the margin charged on new development lending advanced by NAMA is generally of the order of 8%. I am advised that this margin is subject to regular review and may change in line with market conditions.</p></reply>

My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  With regard to demand for particular models of school provision, it should be noted that the patronage process for new schools is a separate process which has been in place since 2011.  This process is run after it has been decided that a new school is required.  Parental preferences are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular school model and medium of instruction. Therefore, where, based on demographics, it might be indicated that a new school is required, it would not be appropriate to indicate that this would be a school under a particular type of patronage as this will be dependent to a large degree on parental preferences in the area at the time of a patronage process. </p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for these school planning areas is being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data.  It is anticipated that decisions based on these exercises will be announced later in 2017.  In addition, I understand that the patron body referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy is involved in substantial discussions with the patron of an existing expanding school in the area in relation to a possible partnership to provide a broader choice of patronage. I welcome this development as an excellent example of constructive cooperation between patron bodies in introducing greater choice and diversity to the system.</p></reply>

Such legacy issues in regard to leave entitlements arose because of the wide variety and the number of employers involved across the public service.  With a view to correcting these issues and with a view to introducing harmonised leave arrangements, initiatives were put in place in various sectors under the overall guidance of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In this context my Department, in consultation with the Management Body, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) and the relevant trade unions representing staff interests in the ETB Sector reached an agreement to harmonise leave allowances for staff.  The agreement reached between the parties found expression in Circular letter 0008/2014 - &ldquo;Revised Annual Leave Arrangements for Staff employed by Education and Training Boards, other than Teachers, Tutors, Special Needs Assistants and Youthreach Resource Persons&rdquo; (link to Circular 0008/2014 - <i><i> </i></i></p><p>Subsequently, my Department, in consultation with the Management Body and the relevant Trade Unions representing staff concerned, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, reached an agreement in December 2016 regarding particular anomalies raised by those unions which had a negative impact on certain staff comprehended by Department Circular 0008/2014. Under the December 2016 agreement there are three types of leave allocations for staff comprehended by this agreement, these are: </p><p>- Existing staff (i.e., those staff in employment in an ETB, or who were in the process of being transferred from SOLAS to an ETB on 6 January 2014) who have had their leave entitlements set in accordance with Circular 0008/2014, within a range of 22 to 32 days. </p><p>- Newly recruited staff (i.e. staff appointed on or after the 7 January 2014) who will have an annual leave entitlement as set for the grade to which they are recruited.  </p><p>-  Newly promoted staff who will maintain their current leave entitlement if the leave entitlement for the grade to which they are promoted is lesser than their current entitlement subject to a maximum entitlement of 30 days annual leave.  Those staff with a current annual leave entitlement of greater than 30 days will have their leave entitlement reduced to 30 days.</p><p>On 15 December 2016, my Department issued a direction to the Chief Executives of Education and Training Boards to implement these arrangements.</p></reply>

Therefore it was not expected that savings would materialise in respect of reduced accommodation needs. In the intervening period additional accommodation requirements have in fact arisen, due to the ETB acquiring its training function in addition to its longstanding post-primary, PLC and further education responsibilities.</p>  <p>  Economies arising during the period of restructuring include those achieved as a result of reductions in administrative staffing costs associated with the streamlining of functions within ETBs and the redeployment of surplus staff. For example, in respect of the former Tipperary VECs there were two Chief Executive Officer posts, whereas the requirement is a single Chief Executive for the ETB. </p>  <p>  As the restructuring was contemporaneous with the operation of the moratorium on public sector recruitment it is not possible to extricate those payroll savings which related specifically to the restructuring. However, cumulative savings of approximately &euro;690,000 were achieved in the Admin and Maintenance staff pay budget provided by my Department to Tipperary ETB in the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. </p>  <p>  A number of other factors have also been at play since the establishment of the ETB. Head office services have adapted and expanded to reflect the need to service the ETB for the new training function, school enrolments have increased, the legislative and regulatory frameworks in which ETBs operate have changed, amongst other things. </p>  <p>  In the light of such momentous and transformational change for the sector, some reinvestment on the personnel side has been necessary. With the coming to the end of the moratorium and the introduction of Delegated Sanction Agreements, progress has been possible. My Department has been working to review and redesign the organisational structure for the ETBs. The first phase of this work saw the strengthening of the senior management team in the ETBs with the approval of posts at Director level for each ETB in the three functional areas of Schools, Further Education and Training and Organisation Support and Development.</p>  <p>  For the sector as a whole, plans are also advanced for the establishment of shared services facilities in the areas of finance and payroll which should result in improved efficiency and consistency in financial and payroll management. </p>  <p>  In view of the evolving nature of the ETB environment as outlined, it is not possible to quantify specific savings from the merger of South Tipperary VEC and North Tipperary VEC.</p></reply>

The student subsequently contacted SUSI on 31 August 2017 to advise that she would in fact be repeating the second year of her course and, as repeat years of study are not eligible for student grant funding save in exceptional circumstances, the student sought to avail of this exception.</p>  <p>  On this basis, the relevant application form for exceptional circumstances consideration was issued to the student by SUSI on 5 September and was returned from the student with supporting documents on 10 September. The case has been reviewed meanwhile and a final decision on the application is currently pending and imminent within the next week. </p>  <p>  SUSI implements procedures for the timely, sensitive and confidential handling of exceptional circumstances applications by students who have already received a grant decision. Exceptional circumstances cases are processed by a dedicated assessment team in direct communication with the student only (or another party to the application, where appropriate).  The issues identified by the Deputy regarding the receipt of documents by SUSI and regarding his communications with SUSI in this case reflect the sensitive and confidential nature of the exceptional circumstances application handling procedure that is implemented by SUSI. </p>  <p>  SUSI has reconfirmed that, while the associated documents as submitted by the student and also those as submitted on her behalf were indeed received, such sensitive documents are not made generally available for viewing to staff outside of the exceptional circumstances team. For this reason, while the main SUSI support desk was able to confirm to the student that documents had been received, they were unable to confirm the details of those actual documents that had been received.</p>  <p>  Similarly, regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s direct communications with the dedicated assessment team, SUSI has advised that it was not possible for the team to respond to the Deputy regarding the case in the absence of the formal third party access authorisation that is required in compliance with data protection measures surrounding the handling of sensitive personal information. This authority was received on 2 October 2017.</p>  <p>  I am informed also that in order to address the issues that the Deputy has highlighted, SUSI has modified its procedures for the handling of exceptional circumstances applications so that the receipt of documents from students, or emails such as those forwarded by the Deputy in the past two weeks, in such cases is now acknowledged at the point of receipt rather than at the point at which the application is reached in order of priority for reassessment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-19a.241.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900061#WRE01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 99 together.</p>  <p>  In overall terms, my Department has no evidence of a recent or current shortage of primary teachers. As the Deputy is aware, we increased the number of primary school teaching posts by 1093 in 2016/17 and schools have filled those positions.  For the current school year, we increased the number of posts by 1160 and the process for filling these positions is almost complete. I am, however,  aware that some schools have experienced difficulty in recruiting adequately qualified substitute teachers, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing this issue.</p>  <p>  The final report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; was published on 9 June 2017.  The report focusses on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, while outlining the work which will be required to establish a sustainable long term model of post primary teacher supply. In considering the model of teacher supply at primary level the report took account of many variables, including the number of additional teachers required to cover for teacher absences, such as illness, maternity leave, career break or secondment.</p>  <p>  The report sets out an approach to planning the work necessary to develop a model for achieving a better balance between teacher supply and demand in the medium to long term. </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are now considering how the development of a model can be progressed, from within available resources. The necessary actions will include engagement with the HEA in order to ensure that the supply of teachers meets demand and there is the correct balance of teachers in each of the various subject areas at post primary level, as well as measures to address data requirements, particularly at post primary level.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, in conjunction with the publication of the report, I announced a number of measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools, in particular to fill short term vacancies. With regard to these measures, my Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council. In that regard, the Teaching Council also reminds teachers, through the renewal of registration process and where a teacher indicates that he or she is considering leaving the register, that if they wish to continue to work as a teacher following retirement in substitute and other positions they should maintain registration. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that my Department has increased the limits for employment while on career break at post primary level to a maximum of 300 hours in a school year and at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year. The matter of the employment of B Ed and PME students in limited circumstances on a short term basis is still under consideration in my Department.</p></reply>

With the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December last, we now have a single application procedure. This is the biggest reform to our protection process in two decades.  It means that an applicant will have all aspects of their claim, refugee status, subsidiary protection status, and permission to remain, examined and determined in one process. Our intention is to provide first instance decisions in the shortest possible timeframe. </p><p>Significant additional resources have been put in place to facilitate this, both at first instance and appeal level and it is expected that further resources will be assigned in the coming period. The landscape of processing and delay has substantially changed. When the Justice McMahon Report was published in 2015, 36% of applicants were in the Direct Provision system for three years or less. This figure is now 72%, which represents a radical improvement.  </p><p>Substantial reforms to the living conditions of applicants in the centres have also been made.  Most significantly, in the Mosney Centre we have established a Food Hall where residents can shop for their own food, based on a points system, which they can then cook in their own homes. On a visit to Mosney for the Friends of the Centre Family Day in July, Justice McMahon praised the centre, saying it provided a template for other State provided accommodation centres to follow. Cooking facilities have also been provided in centres such as Kinsale Road, and Clonakilty in Cork and St. Patrick&rsquo;s in Monaghan to enable individual families to cook for themselves. This is an important part of everyday family life and these facilities will be rolled out to all family centres into the future. In some instances structural work is needed to provide these facilities which by definition impacts on delivery times.  </p><p>An increase to the disposable income for adults and children living in State provide accommodation was provided earlier this year. Since the Justice McMahon Report, we have more than doubled the weekly rate of Direct Provision Allowance for children. A Taskforce chaired by my Department and with representatives from a wide range of Departments and Agencies is currently examining the Supreme Court judgement on the right to work and is expected to produce its recommendations in the near future.</p><p>Improvements continue to be implemented across the facilities and services provided by my Department to those in the protection process and this work will continue until it is completed.</p></reply>

For example, I understand that in cases of serious injury to the victim, it can take a considerable amount of time (in some cases a number of years) before their treating consultant is in a position to give a final prognosis.  It is also often necessary to await Garda reports arising from the related criminal investigation before a final decision can be made in a case.  By their nature, such investigations can be lengthy and complex. As a result of these factors, which are outside the control of the tribunal, waiting times can vary significantly.</p></reply>

Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors and circumstances that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child in such proceedings. The courts shall have regard to all of these factors or circumstances that it regards as being relevant to the child concerned and his or her family and make its decision accordingly.</p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to enumerate the various and diverse family situations in which equal shared parenting would or would not be in a child&rsquo;s best interests. It is a matter for the courts, in the context of proceedings under the 1964 Act, to determine the best interests of each child to whom such proceedings relate in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Minister for Justice and Equality has no functions in that regard.  </p>  <p>  It is also a matter for the courts when making orders under the 1964 Act in relation to matters such as the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child to consider whether or not any conditions should be attached to such orders.

I remain in close contact with the Commissioner and I will continue to provide every support possible to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na face down the threat posed by violent criminal gangs.<b></b></p><p>Garda operational responses to gang-related crime in Dublin are coordinated under Operation Hybrid. As of 11 September 2017, there have been 64 arrests in relation to gang-related killings, with 8 persons charged in connection with those murders and a further 3 persons charged with related offences. In addition, 30 firearms have been seized and over 13,170 lines of enquiry conducted. In excess of 39,620 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact.</p><p>At the request of the Garda Commissioner in 2016, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  In particular funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the DMR. The new dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region was launched on 14 December 2016, and is now operational on a 24/7 basis. The establishment of the new ASU had been a particular priority given the identified need to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit. All the necessary resources have been provided to equip the new ASU and we have also taken steps to upgrade the equipment available to the Emergency Response Unit and the Special Detective Unit.</p><p>During 2016, the Garda Commissioner established a Special Task Force to target a number of organised crime gangs based in the Dublin area with particular emphasis on the second and third level criminals. As part of the setting up of this unit, which is under the control of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, six Garda&iacute; and one Sergeant were seconded to the Criminal Assets Bureau to assist in the investigations into the persons identified to trace and target any assets which have been generated through their criminal conduct.</p><p>New powers have been introduced under the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provides for Bureau Officers, subject to certain conditions, to immediately seize and detain property for a 24 hour period. Provision is also made for this period to be extended upon the authorisation of the Chief Bureau Officer, subject to certain conditions, for a further period not exceeding 21 days. In this context, the Act also lowered the thresholds applicable to seizures by reducing the value of property involved from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000. In addition, new regulations were made to reduce the prescribed amount of cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime which can be seized, from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000. </p><p>In addition, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2016, brought forward by the Minister for Health, has new provisions to counteract the illegal sale of prescription drugs. On 5 July 2016, Government approval was granted in relation to enhancing and updating legislation for the lawful interception of communications and for covert electronic surveillance, and work in this regard is ongoing. My Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also considering if there are any other legislative measures which might strengthen the response to the activities of organised crime groups. We have also seen the introduction of rules of court to complete the establishment of a second Special Criminal Court, so that it can deal with the backlog of cases on hand.</p><p>We have also seen unprecedented cooperation between Irish and Spanish authorities leading to important arrests and seizures, with police officers from both jurisdictions participating in successful joint operations in Ireland and in Spain. There has also been an important arrest of a suspect in the Netherlands and I am committed to ensuring that Garda&iacute; will continue to have all necessary supports to continue their pursuit of criminal groups in cooperation with other police forces as required.</p><p>The Deputy is aware of the substantial investments which have been made in policing resources, including an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime in 2017 which will facilitate the continuation of large-scale policing operations, including those targeting gangland crime, burglary and terrorist activities. Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<b></b></p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division as appropriate.</p>  <p>  I can say however that this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this it has a vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  This recruitment target is an ambitious one and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. The most recent recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) on behalf of the Commissioner in May of this year again received a strong response with more than 5,000 applications received. It is expected that successful candidates from this campaign will start to enter the Garda College in the second quarter of 2018. </p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 2,400 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next three years in addition to the 2,000 recruited that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that projected departures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are kept under continuing review and the level of recruitment adjusted as necessary in order to achieve the desired strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is expected that there will be in the region of 300 departures each year in the next three years.  </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the position regarding the waiting times for the various courts for 2012 to 2016, as provided in the Courts Service Annual Reports, is as follows:</p><p>Supreme Court</p><p>Under the direction of the then Chief Justice, by the end of 2016 the Supreme Court had almost entirely disposed of its retained legacy appeals. At its peak the total backlog amounted to almost 3,000 appeals with consequential waiting times up to four and a half years in some cases.<b></b>The current position in relation to the new jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is set out as follows:</p><p>-  average waiting time for applications for leave to appeal from filing of complete documentation to determination - 6 weeks, and</p><p>-  average waiting time for appeals from determination of leave application to appeal hearing - 50 weeks.</p><p>Court of Appeal</p><p>Following the establishment of the Court of Appeal on 28 October 2014 the waiting times for appeals has reduced significantly and the waiting times at June 2017 were as follows:</p><p>(a) Civil Appeals</p><p>-  fast tracked short appeals (requiring less that 2 hours) - 12 months subject to the case being included in the &quot;short cases&quot; list and with the possibility of an earlier date, and</p><p>-  other appeals (requiring more than 2 hours) - the waiting time for these appeals is 18 months.  </p><p>Urgent appeals such as Hague Convention/child abduction and refugee asylum cases continue to be accommodated having regard to the degree of urgency demonstrated. Also civil appeals which have a custody and/or criminal element are now case-managed in the Criminal Courts of Justice by the panel of 4 judges assigned to deal with the criminal appeal list thus ensuring the degree of priority necessary for hearing of such appeals. As a result waiting times for these cases are as follows:</p><p>-  Article 40/ habeas corpus appeals and bail appeals are usually heard in one month or less,</p><p>-  European Arrest Warrant cases and Judicial Review cases are heard within the current legal term provided the necessary papers are in order. </p><p>(b) Criminal Appeals</p><p>Criminal Appeals have a waiting time of 6 months. This is significantly better than the 18 month waiting time in the Court of Criminal Appeal prior to the establishment of the Court of Appeal.  Hearing dates can now be allocated during the subsequent legal term to the majority of cases included in the List to Fix Dates (held once a term). An occasional case which requires a full day or in excess of a day, or a case where for various reasons a date during a specific week/month is requested by the parties and which the court simply cannot accommodate due to the availability of court time, will be allocated a date during the subsequent term.  </p><p>Criminal appeals (and civil appeals for hearing in the Criminal Courts of Justice) are actively managed on a weekly basis by the Judge assigned to management of the criminal lists to ensure cases are dealt with as efficiently as possible and delays in moving cases to the List to Fix Dates due to procedural issues arising are kept to a minimum. Applications for priority may be made at the weekly management list.</p><p>Special Criminal Court</p><p>The waiting time for a hearing date in the Special Criminal Courts is now 12 months following the establishment of the Second Special Criminal Court on 6 May 2016. This compares with up to 24 months prior to the establishment of the Second Special Criminal Court. </p><p>High Court</p><p>An analysis of waiting times for the High Court shows a reduction in waiting times generally across all court lists and venues over the past five years. For example, waiting times for personal injury actions in Cork have reduced from 24 months to 14 months; in Dublin from 8 months to 5 weeks; in Dundalk from 9 months to 7 months; in Galway from 10 months to 2 months; in Limerick from 18 months to 6 months, and in Sligo from 6 months to 5 months. In Kilkenny waiting times have been maintained at 7 months. Waiting times for Asylum pre-leave actions have reduced from 30 months to 7 months and this is now being reduced further due to case management measures.</p><p>The only High Court Actions list showing increased waiting times over this period are non-jury actions, including Circuit Court appeals have extended from 6 months to 9 months.  </p><p>Central Criminal Court </p><p>The current waiting time in the Central Criminal Court is 12 Months. Prior to securing a fifth Judge in October 2015, the waiting times had extended to 18 months.  </p><p>Circuit Court and District Court</p><p>Circuit and District Courts are courts of local jurisdiction and waiting times vary from venue to venue based on the number, complexity and scheduling of cases. The data provided in the Courts Service Annual Reports indicates that waiting times are being maintained or reduced across most venues and the categories of cases.</p><p>The Courts Service has also informed me that the Presidents of the various courts work together with the Courts Service to achieve improvements in waiting times and continue to arrange additional sittings where possible within the resources available to them to deal with any delays in the hearing of cases and to target judicial resources at the areas of greatest need. </p><p>The Courts Service has advised that delays in the hearing of cases can occur for a number of reasons, many of which are outside the control of the Courts and the Courts Service, for example, the unavailability of a witness or vital evidence, delays in the furnishing of reports or because the parties and/or legal practitioners are not ready to proceed on allocated dates. This gives rise to adjournments which can have a major impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which can be disposed of in a court sitting.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, a Group to review the administration of civil justice in the State, chaired by the President of the High Court Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, was established recently. Membership, reporting structures and the remit of the Group are in the process of being finalised and the first meeting of the Group is scheduled for 9 November 2017. </p><p>The Group is to report to me within two years, and will make recommendations for changes with a view to improving access to civil justice in the State, promoting early resolution of disputes, reducing the cost of litigation, creating a more responsive and proportionate system and ensuring better outcomes for court users. </p></reply>

These studies are on the website www.cso.ie.</p>  <p>   The 2016 study reports on:</p>  <p>  -  Prison Recidivism which is a detailed study on those who were released from a custodial prison sentence in 2010 and whether they were subsequently convicted of a further offence up to the end of 2013 and </p>  <p>  -  Probation Recidivism which is a detailed study of recidivism among offenders placed under Probation Service supervision in 2010.</p>  <p>  The Prison Recidivism Study&rsquo;s findings indicate that the recidivism or re-offending rate was 45.1% for the particular cohort of offenders released in 2010. When compared with the equivalent cohort from the 2009 study there is a fall in recidivism of 2.4%. This follows the 3.5% decrease that was seen for the 2009 cohort from the previous report. </p>  <p>  The Probation Recidivism Study demonstrates that overall almost 63% of offenders did not re-offend within a 3-year period of being placed under the supervision of the Probation Service. It further showed that 66.1% of offenders on Community Service Orders did not re-offend within a 3-year period</p>  <p>  My Department recognises that, in order to protect the public and reduce victimisation in Irish society, a joined-up approach to the management of offenders is essential. In this respect, the first Joint Strategy on Offender Management agreed between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service has been operating since September 2016. </p>  <p>  An example of this coordinated response is the Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC) involving the four bodies cited above. It is a strategic response to the management of prioritised prolific offenders. Its objectives are to target the 25% of recidivists who are responsible for 75% of crime; to manage nominated prolific offenders in order to reduce crime and; enhance public safety by strengthening the co-ordination and integration of policy, practice and research. </p>  <p>  A number of joint agency operational initiatives have been established under J-ARC on a pilot basis. In 2017, J-ARC was extended to manage and address the criminal behaviour of nominated young people aged 16 to 21 years old which resulted in the inclusion of the Departments of Health; Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs; and Education &amp;amp; Skills, as well as Tusla. </p>  <p>  A further development in this area is the Youth Joint Agency Response to Crime Initiative (Y J-ARC) launched in 2017. This targets young people aged 16 to 21 years who are the most prolific in their offending. It provides an operational approach for co-ordinated and enhanced levels of co-operation between the Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Irish Prison Service, Irish Youth Justice Service (Oberstown campus), Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills. It places the young person at the centre of the process and identifies his/her needs, strengths and risk; and provides an interagency co-operation and a co-ordinated response in addressing those needs and risks.  </p>  <p>  Another example of the response to repeat offending is the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015. This Act targets repeat burglary offenders through new measures relating to bail and the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat offending and aims improve the safety of our communities. It is encouraging to note that the CSO official recorded crime statistics for the twelve months of 2016 show a 30% decrease in burglary when compared to 2015.</p>  <p>  Overall, our justice agencies are committed to working together to reduce the level of harm and disruption in communities caused by prolific offenders and to reduce the level of crime committed by the individuals concerned.  Working in collaboration with other statutory bodies and with community and voluntary partners I have every confidence they will achieve an effective outcome. </p></reply>

There is also a constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2017 (changed from the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016), which was enacted in June of this year, strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.   </p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Court will be required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence, that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  The Court will also have the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken.  </p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act will provide for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthen Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail, increase the use of curfews, and introduce electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances where requested by Garda&iacute;.</p></reply>

This follows the Government's approval in July 2016 of a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the Government&rsquo;s response to the Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government aimed at increasing the visibility, effectiveness and responsiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  The key structural change under the Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan is the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis, subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in both urban and rural areas. </p>  <p>  The Divisional model is being out on a phased basis starting with a pilot programme. The four Divisions of DMR South Central, Cork City, Galway and Mayo have been selected for the pilot in order to provide a mix of urban and rural policing environments. This new model  will support the more flexible and effective deployment of Garda resources.</p>  <p>  The Policing Authority is overseeing the implementation of the reform programme and reporting on a quarterly basis. It latest progress report - its third which is available on my Department's website - indicated positive progress has been made in the development and implementation of the Divisional/functional model of policing and it is continuing to monitor progress in relation to the pilots, in particular any learnings which could be applied in advance of the national rollout. The Authority has also indicated that it would like to see this project progressed more rapidly.</p>  <p>  I believe the only way to deliver world class policing in Ireland is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs and that those resources operate in an organisation whose culture is open and responsive and where the best management systems and practices are deployed.  I am confident that the reform plan, including the development of a functional model of policing that is being pursued by An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, supported by the Government and overseen by the Policing Authority, has the capacity to achieve this.  It will not be done overnight but as I have made clear, the implementation of the ambitious reform programme, including the implementation of the Divisional model, must continue and, indeed, must move at a greater pace, to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland. </p></reply>

Provision is also made for this period to be extended upon the authorisation of the Chief Bureau Officer, subject to certain conditions, for a further period not exceeding 21 days. In this context, the Act also lowered the thresholds applicable to seizures by reducing the value of property involved from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000. In addition, new regulations were made to reduce the prescribed amount of cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime which can be seized, from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises multi-disciplinary approaches to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted. This includes the use of money-laundering legislation and the powers available to the Criminal Assets Bureau under the proceeds of crime legislation.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2017, which is currently being drafted, will enhance our existing anti-money laundering framework. It will provide additional powers to the Financial Intelligence Unit, situated in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and strengthen cross-border cooperation between it and relevant authorities in other Member States.</p></reply>

These programmes can offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners, including first time offenders, are eligible to use the services. </p>  <p>  The IPS began recruiting Assistant Psychologists to the IPS Psychology Service in 2016.  Assistant Psychologists focus primarily on mental health and sentence management work with prisoners.  Specifically, Assistant Psychologists are tasked with completing Strength, Risk and Needs Assessments of young persons, 18-24 years, who are committed to custody on a sentence of one year or more and who do not have a post release supervision order, to better inform their sentence progression and appropriate interventions.  The intention of this focussed approach is to assist young persons committed to custody in living law-abiding and purposeful lives on their release to the community.  The Probation Service have recently joined this initiative by engaging in assessments with those 18-24 year olds who do have post release supervision orders.</p>  <p>  The development of programmes for prisoners forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2016 - 2018. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  </p>  <p>  Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the Education Training Boards and the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning. A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University.  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing people for release.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems to this end peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.</p>  <p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds and the Guild of Cleaners and Launderers and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the prison service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p></reply>

Family members and friends  often elect or are assigned a shared cell. Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm.</p><p>In addition, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service has appointed a high-level Group to introduce a standard Risk Assessment Tool for use throughout the prison estate.  </p><p>This Risk Assessment Tool will include provisions for the assessment of prisoners for suitability for cell-sharing, for moves within individual prisons and other operational decisions.  The Assessment Tool is currently being developed with professional advice and assistance from the State Claims Agency.</p><p>This Risk Assessment Tool will include provisions for the assessment of people in custody for suitability for cell-sharing, for moves within individual prisons and other operational decisions.  The Assessment Tool is currently being developed with professional advice and assistance from the State Claims Agency, and is very much at an advanced stage and is subject to the usual operational and security considerations.</p></reply>

However, I understand that information in this regard is available in the Annual Reports of the ODPP.</p>  <p>  The non-conviction based model for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime is that deployed by the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2016 provide the legal framework underpinning the Bureau's powers to take all necessary actions, including the making of applications to the High Court, in relation to the seizing and securing of assets with a view to their disposal in due course in accordance with the provisions of that legislation. </p>  <p>  Section 21 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 requires the Bureau, through the Garda Commissioner, to provide a report of its activities each year to the Minister for Justice and Equality who is then required to lay copies of the report before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Annual Reports, including the most recent one for 2016 which was published last July, are available in the Oireachtas library and on the website of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my own Department.  In Part 3 of the 2016 Report for instance, detailed information is provided in relation to the number of cases brought before the High Court under the various provisions of the Act; the number, type and valuation of assets involved; and the value of assets transferred to the Minister for Finance following the making of a disposal order by the High Court under Section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 - 2016.  Comparative data relating to the actions of the Bureau under the Revenue Acts and the Social Welfare Consolidation Act are also provided in the Annual Reports of the Bureau.</p>  <p>  In examining the reports of the Bureau, the Deputy might note that it is the assets of individuals rather than criminal gangs that are reported.</p></reply>

This does not include subversive groupings in Portlaoise. </p>  <p>  Membership or allegiance of these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated on a daily basis. As such it is not possible to provide numbers in relation to the number of known gang members released in the past five years.</p>  <p>  The emergence in recent years of criminal gangs has had significant implications for the management of Irish Prisons. Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside the prison. Prison management must ensure that the various factions are kept apart, and as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates in the prisons or criminal activities outside. </p>  <p>  A number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons. For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Support Group have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison. These initiatives include the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines. The core function of this group includes the gathering and collating of intelligence information on criminal gang members in custody, carrying out intelligence led searches and preventing the flow of contraband, including mobile phones, into the prisons.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs.</p></reply>

In this context, among the range of justice measures announced in the Budget, the Government committed to recruiting 800 additional Garda&iacute; in 2018 as well as an additional 500 civilians.</p>  <p>  In addition, under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2015-2021, significant investment is being made to upgrade the Garda building estate, the Garda fleet and the Garda ICT infrastructure. Indeed, the Plan provides for total investment in Garda capital of over &euro;400 million over the next four years, including an additional &euro;157 million following the mid-term review of the Plan, as well as a major Public Private Partnership project to deliver three new Garda Headquarters in Sligo, Macroom and Clonmel.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. </p>  <p>  In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division. I am further advised by the Commissioner that recent census data is currently being incorporated into the personnel allocation model. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division as appropriate. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, a number of important steps have been taken in recent years to strengthen the protection afforded to vulnerable and adults in the States&rsquo;s day care and residential care settings.</p><p>Within the health sector specifically, the HSE published its national safeguarding policy and procedures, <i>Safeguarding Vulnerable People at Risk of Abuse,</i>in December 2014.  This safeguarding policy was the first such HSE policy to encompass both elder abuse and concerns of abuse relating to people availing of disability services.  A number of important steps have been taken to progress implementation of this policy, including the establishment by the HSE of a National Safeguarding Office, and the establishment of Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each of the Executive&rsquo;s CHO areas. In addition, a National Safeguarding Committee was formally established in December 2015. The Committee has multi-agency and inter-sectoral representation.  One of its strategic objectives is the initiation of conversations with Government and Oireachtas Committees on the development of legislation on adult safeguarding.  The work to date of the National Safeguarding Committee has confirmed that the scope of the issues around the safeguarding of vulnerable adults goes far beyond the area of health.  </p><p>A detailed review of the operation of the HSE&rsquo;s safeguarding policy to date is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed by early 2018.  The review includes research and analysis of legislative and procedural approaches to safeguarding vulnerable adults in other jurisdictions.  The findings of the HSE&rsquo;s safeguarding review, when completed, will be of particular value in informing the development of appropriate policy approaches and the preparation of such legislation as may be required in the context of developing a national safeguarding policy framework for the health sector.</p><p>I fully support the principle of providing a legislative basis for the safeguarding of vulnerable adults.  My Department is also exploring the development of an appropriate request to the Law Reform Commission to assist with legal research regarding the current safeguarding landscape and the legal gaps that may exist.  </p><p>As you are aware, at the recent meetings of the Joint Committee on Health, the issue of adult safeguarding was extensively discussed.  The Department outlined its intention, subject to Government approval, to develop a comprehensive health policy on safeguarding adults at risk and associated legislation.  The HSE review of it's safeguarding policy and other research, including consultation with other Departments, key stakeholders and the public, will help to inform the scope and content of a health sector policy and legislation, including the role, functions and powers of any authority and its officers that may have a part to play in safeguarding.</p><p>The development of a health policy and legislation is a complex undertaking and will take time, however, I am hopeful that preliminary proposals on a high level approach can be brought to Government this year.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,700 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>-  There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>-  There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>-  Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p><p>-  The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.</p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

Public patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of another Member State under the Cross-Border Directive (CBD). Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways, i.e. they must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  It is important to note that reimbursement is confined to the costs of the care itself and that the rates of reimbursement cannot exceed the cost of provision of the care if it were provided in the Irish public health service.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians. The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long term care, organ transplantation, etc. All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the EU Directive on Patients&rsquo; Rights in Cross Border Healthcare in Ireland. In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website - www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/ - and also by phone, 056 778 4551. The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. </p></reply>

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position of the Government and the Oireachtas that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may make a complaint to the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review process, which is currently underway. The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.</p></reply>

In other health insurance systems the level of risk that an individual presents directly affects the premium paid.

The application of waiting periods helps support community rating and is an important tool for insurers to combat practices where someone could potentially take out a health insurance policy to avail of a particular treatment and then cancel the policy once treatment had been received, without either penalty or sustained contribution to the community-rated system. </p><p><b>New Customer Maximum Waiting Periods</b><table><tr><th>Accident and Injuries</th><th>Illnesses that commence after you join</th><th>Illnesses that commence before you join</th><th>Maternity related claims</th></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>26 weeks</td><td>5 years</td><td>52 weeks</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The report also concluded  that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  Therefore, medical card provision is solely based on financial assessment.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card. </p><p>However, in the assessment of applications the HSE seeks, within the framework of the legislation, to exercise discretion.  In that regard the HSE assesses the financial, social and medical circumstances of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. This assessment informs the decisions taken by the HSE on whether to award a medical card on a discretionary basis.</p><p>Access to free prosthesis after cancer treatment is a service matter, therefore, I have asked the HSE to reply to the Deputy directly on this matter. </p></reply>

Judge Clark's Report, included, as an appendix,  a review undertaken by Professor Leo Lawler, Director of Radiology Services, consultant radiologist Mater Hospital and visiting Consultant to the Rotunda Hospital entitled &quot;<i>Symphysiotomy &amp;amp; Pubiotomy Review - a Imaging Perspectivs</i>&quot;.</p><p>In order to undertake her role under her Terms of Reference in an informed manner, Judge Clark drew on the professional expertise of certain medical specialists in the areas of obstetrics, radiology, orthopaedic surgery and pelvic injury, urology and urogynaecology, who advised the Scheme throughout the process. Professor Lawler advised on radiology and Judge Clark notes in her report that he &quot;attended for weekly meetings to advise and discuss&quot;. She noted that radiology could confirm that surgical intervention had occurred and it also provided evidence to permit a finding of significant disability. </p><p>While my Department arranged for payments to be made to the medical experts, it was done on the instruction of Judge Clark. As the office of the Judge was independent, my Department had no role in determining the terms of reference for any work undertaken by the experts or making any decisions regarding medical expertise or research that Judge Clark deemed necessary to undertake her role under the Terms of Reference for the Scheme. Invoice records show that Prof Lawler's services to Judge Clark included reviews of radiographs, CT scans or MRIs, case discussions, literature reviews, correspondence with hospitals and solicitors and preparation of a review of the Scheme. Documents released under FOI show that the cost of the review was in the region of &euro;6,600. Professor Lawler names 11 doctors who were specialist registrars or radiology fellows who assisted him in his work, but no payments were made by my Department to these individuals.</p><p>I have no additional information other than what is provided by Professor Lawler in his Report regarding the demographics used, or the x-rays or imaging which were accessed for the purpose of his work. Judge Clark, however, was happy that the information merited inclusion in her independent report to me on the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

Given their unique exposure to the UK market, my Department&rsquo;s funding (&euro;9 million out of total public funding of &euro;23 million) ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses.  </p>  <p>  The finance will be easier to access, more competitively priced (at a proposed maximum interest rate of 4%), and at more favourable terms than current offerings. This will give Brexit-impacted businesses time and space to adapt and to grow into the future. Applications will be cleared for Scheme eligibility through the SBCI and applicants must be exposed to the current or potential impacts of Brexit and submit a business sustainability plan which demonstrates how they plan to respond to Brexit. Loans must be for the purpose of supporting working capital or cash flow needs and will be provided by commercial lenders, subject to normal lending criteria. Further details of the loans will be provided over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The success of our &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; has been recognised and it provides a template for this new Scheme. Drawdowns under the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme are nearing completion. Due to the different State Aid legislation covering primary production, the Brexit Loan Scheme announced in the Budget will not be available to farmers and fishermen. Therefore I was very pleased to announce that I have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of a new Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and food businesses in 2018. Further details will be announced in due course.  </p>  <p>  We all understand the unique exposure of the agri-food sector to Brexit impact. Uncertainty about the final outcome can make planning for the future difficult. But one thing we can be sure of is that both food businesses and farmers need to focus on competitiveness and innovation in order to survive these challenges and grow their business sustainably in the future. Supporting lower cost flexible finance is a key Government response to assist the sector in this process.</p></reply>

This co-ordinated, Government-led, strategy aims to reduce both overall population and individual risk, particularly for people living in areas with high radon levels.</p>  <p>  There were 31 identified action points set out in the NRCS, and it is intended that all will be implemented. Work has commenced on 27 of these action points, with 11 now complete, 10 on track for completion by May 2018, and the remainder being actively progressed. A progress report on implementation is submitted to me annually.</p>  <p>  While the economic analysis demonstrates that in general the radon intervention measures proposed in the strategy are cost-effective, it also shows that dealing with radon through prevention in new buildings is by far the most cost-effective approach.</p>  <p>  Cost has been identified as a disincentive to householders to both test and remediate their homes for radon. One of the recommendations made by the NRCS relates to financial incentives to encourage household action on radon. My Department is currently examining the feasibility of providing such financial incentives. </p></reply>

This will save over 120,000 tonnes in carbon emissions every year. It will support around 3,500 jobs, and reduce our overall dependence on imported fossil fuels. As the Deputy notes, this is an increase of &euro;35m over the allocation for 2017. I have outlined below  key interventions which will receive funding in 2018 and I will keep these and financial allocations under review  through the course of the year.</p>  <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is currently engaged in a review of the technologies supported under the Better Energy Homes grant programme. Increased funding will allow SEAI to take a broader look at what new technologies might be supported under the scheme in 2018.</p>  <p>  I will also continue to support collective local action on energy efficiency. The Better Energy Communities scheme continues to go from strength to strength and the additional funding I have secured for 2018 will increase funds available to this scheme.</p>  <p>  Activity has significantly ramped up on the Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing scheme in 2017 with nearly 500 homes completed to date. A further &euro;8m in capital funding has been allocated to the scheme for 2018 which will see activity increase to at least 600 home completions in 2018.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I announced that those people identified as living in the poorest condition homes would receive a deeper energy efficiency than standard under the Warmer Homes scheme. So far in 2017, SEAI have already identified many homes that are in a very poor condition and these will be considered for upgrade under the Warmer Homes scheme. In total, funding in 2018 will provide for the upgrade of over 9,000 low income homes.</p>  <p>  The Commercial sector has significant potential to contribute to national energy efficiency and climate change objectives. I am increasing our capital investment in this sector to provide for the expansion of the successful Energy Efficiency in Design or EXEED Programme. Launched on a pilot basis in 2017, companies participating in the scheme are seeing an impressive 28% energy efficiency improvement on average. This helps to improve the competitiveness and resilience of Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  I am also determined that we harness more of the energy efficiency potential in our farms and small businesses. My Department is currently consulting on how best we can increase awareness of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency for businesses and the allocation of additional funds will be guided by the results of this consultation.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the public sector has already made a very significant contribution to national energy efficiency objectives, having already achieved energy efficiency gains of 20%. In 2017 new pilot support schemes were put in place for the renovation of public buildings and for our schools that saw schools reduce their energy bills by more than 40% on average. Given these promising results I am nearly doubling the budget for these works in 2018. I hope that this will identify the optimal approaches and standards that can be replicated and scaled more widely across the public sector.</p></reply>

Examples include: the introduction of fixed payment notices for the contravention of specific conditions of a waste collection permit; providing for the review of a waste collection permit in primary legislation and also specifying instances whereby an automatic review of a permit is triggered; and strengthening the provisions around what constitutes a 'fit and proper person' to hold a waste collection permit. Furthermore, legislation has been introduced to explicitly strengthen the regulation of household waste collectors, including requirements on operators to have customer charters in place; to weigh each and every collection of waste and to make that weight available to the householder; and to provide a minimum level of service in terms of the collection of recyclable material and food waste.</p><p>In line with <i>A Resource Opportunity </i>and in the interest of encouraging further waste prevention, flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection will be phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018, as customers contracts come up for renewal. The necessary regulatory steps are being put in place to give effect to this, however, it is worth noting that the measure to phase out flat fees is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or weight related fee.</p><p>Information and awareness campaigns have been, and will continue to be, rolled out by the Department and the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices to take account of the new approach to waste reduction, increased recycling and charging. In particular, the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices will continue to roll out waste awareness and education initiatives re-focussing on the use of the brown bin, but also concentrating on improving and increasing recycling, waste prevention and the correct use of the kerbside collection system.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above measures, a Household Waste Collection Price Monitoring Group has been established and has begun the process of monitoring the rates charged by household waste collectors. The Household Waste Collection Price Monitoring Group has met on two occasions, 13 September, 2017 and 11 October, 2017. The Group comprises representatives from the Waste Policy &amp;amp; Resource Efficiency Division and an economist from my Department, the Central Statistics Office and a company with expertise in price monitoring. The company made a presentation to the Group at the meeting on 11 October, 2017 based on the data it had collected as part of the first data sweep of the market.  They will report back to the Group on a monthly basis and a report on the data collected will be published.  </p><p>In addition, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to conduct a study on the operation of the household waste collection market. The CCPC has indicated that it hopes to finalise the study in early 2018.</p><p>The results from the Household Waste Collection Price Monitoring Group will be monitored and analysed and in conjunction with the study being undertaken by the CCPC, provide an evidence base regarding future monitoring or the potential need for additional regulation of the waste market.</p></reply>

The Better Energy Programme consists of the Better Energy Homes Scheme, Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, and Better Energy Communities Scheme.</p><p>The Better Energy Homes (BEH) Scheme provides grant aid to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home. Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER). </p><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes (BEWH) scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, who meet the eligibility criteria. The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation. </p><p>The Better Energy Communities Programme (BEC) aims to encourage community based partnerships to improve the thermal and electrical efficiency of the building stock and energy poor homes and facilities, encouraging the implementation of deeper and more technically and economically challenging measures. </p><p>The table details the numbers of homes that have received energy efficiency measures under each scheme.<table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Better Energy Homes</td><td>45,946</td><td>49,229</td><td>26,423</td><td>13,710</td><td>9,927</td><td>12,339</td><td>15,265</td><td>10,863</td></tr><tr><td>Better Energy Warmer Homes</td><td>24,291</td><td>20,388</td><td>12,175</td><td>9,803</td><td>9,056</td><td>6,867</td><td>6,743</td><td>5,346</td></tr><tr><td>Better Energy Communities</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>2,263</td><td>3,617</td><td>4,004</td><td>2,500</td><td>2,013</td><td>0**</td></tr><tr><td>Warmth and Wellbeing*</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>72</td><td>196</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>70,237</td><td>69,617</td><td>40,861</td><td>27,130</td><td>22,987</td><td>21,706</td><td>24,093</td><td>16,405</td></tr></table>*The Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing Scheme was introduced in 2016, The aim of this Pilot is to provide deep energy efficiency interventions to people living with chronic respiratory conditions who are in or at risk of energy poverty. By making their homes warmer, more comfortable and cheaper to run, it is hoped that this will improve their health and wellbeing. In 2017 the Pilot Scheme has been extended to include families with children aged 12 and under who are living with chronic respiratory condition. While 268 homes have been upgraded to date, works are underway on another 262 homes. Recruitment of participants will continue over the winter months and those people will have their upgrades carried out as early as possible in 2018, as this type of work cannot always take place during the winter.  </p><p>**Figure declared later in the year.</p></reply>

The Convention governs environmental justice rights, and is formed by three aspects, or &lsquo;pillars of the Convention,&rsquo; namely: Access to Information on the Environment; Public Participation in Decision-Making in Environmental Matters; and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. The Heads of the Bill focus primarily on the Access to Justice pillar. Key elements of this require, amongst other things, that review procedures be fair, adequate and not prohibitively expensive, and that people should have awareness of their rights in environmental decision-making. </p>  <p>  There are two EU Directives implementing the Access to Information on the Environment and Public Participation elements of the Convention, but none for Access to Justice, one reason for this being that Ireland, the United Kingdom and some other Member States have a dual common law system instead of just civil law. To address this at national level, a public consultation was carried out in 2014 focussing on the Access to Justice pillar of the Convention to stimulate and facilitate discussion at a domestic level.</p>  <p>  The draft Heads of the Bill were initially prepared in response to the outcomes of the public consultation at the end of 2014. Progress was delayed pending clarification from the EU Commission on whether a Directive on the Access to Justice pillar would be brought forward. It was confirmed in June 2015 that a Directive would not be issuing, and a guidance document would be made available. This guidance document was published in April 2017, and will be taken into account before publication of the draft Heads of Bill later this year. Ireland was represented at a recent EU Experts Group to discuss the guidance document, with feedback to be submitted shortly to the EU Commission.</p></reply>

My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement. A copy of the Agreement is available on my Department's website www.dccae.gov.ie. Whilst the full programme of work is due to be completed by the end of 2018, more precise information on the timeframe for rollout is available from eir&rsquo;s website on </p><p>I also published an updated High Speed Broadband Map in April which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.</p><p>- LIGHT BLUE premises are part of eir&rsquo;s 300k rural rollout.</p><p>I will outline below the distribution of premises into each category in the 5 townlands in question. Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE, LIGHT BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie.</p><p>Townland: Piercetown - Total Premises: 26 Premises Covered:</p><p>- 85% (22) AMBER</p><p>- 8% (2) BLUE</p><p>- 8% (2) LIGHT BLUE </p><p>Townland: Fordstown - Total Premises: 38 Premises Covered:</p><p>- 5% (2) AMBER</p><p>- 0% (0) BLUE</p><p>- 95% (36) LIGHT BLUE</p><p>Townland: Pluckstown - Total Premises: 22 Premises Covered:</p><p>- 27% (6) AMBER</p><p>- 73% (16) BLUE</p><p>- 0% (0) LIGHT BLUE</p><p>Townland: Grennanstown - Total Premises: 34 Premises Covered:</p><p>- 65% (22) AMBER</p><p>- 35% (12) BLUE</p><p>- 0% (0) LIGHT BLUE</p><p>Townland: Causestown - Total Premises: 25 Premises Covered:</p><p>- 12% (3) AMBER</p><p>- 88% (22) BLUE</p><p>- 0% (0) LIGHT BLUE</p><p>My Department is engaged in an on-going procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out the new high speed broadband network for the State led intervention. A significant milestone in that process was reached in September with the submission of &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; by two bidders. This is the last stage before receipt of final tenders and progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder(s). </p><p>To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers. These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The towing capacity of a vehicle can be verified by consulting the owner&rsquo;s handbook or the manufacturer&rsquo;s statutory plate affixed to the vehicle. The towing capacity weight is the maximum weight of the trailer that the vehicle can tow. The towing capacity of any vehicles should never be exceeded. </p>  <p>  The maximum weight that can be towed is also dependent on the driver&rsquo;s driving licence category. A person can tow a trailer on a B (car) licence if the trailer&rsquo;s Design Gross Vehicle Weight (DGVW). A category BE licence is required if it is more than 750kg but the combined weight of the vehicle and trailer does not exceed 3,500kg. As a general rule, a category B licence would not allow the towing of a livestock trailer.

Ports are expected to fund their activities, including all maintenance works and capital infrastructure investment from their own resources.</p>  <p>  In keeping with National Ports Policy, the provision of adequate and efficient capacity into the future is a crucial strategic objective. However, the planning and development of large-scale infrastructure such as commercial port development requires significant organisational, operational and financial resources. It is important that bodies bringing forward significant port capacity projects have the resources required. Therefore, Government expects the Ports of National Significance to lead the response of the State commercial ports sector to future national port capacity requirements.</p>  <p>  All three of the Tier 1 Ports of National Significance, Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes, have Masterplans (i.e. long term planning) in play and are currently engaged in major infrastructural projects to increase draft, berth size and capacity. These developments are funded by the ports themselves.</p>  <p>  There is no short-term pressure on national port capacity. In fact, some ports are currently operating under capacity. </p>  <p>  In relation to the five Ports of Regional Significance, Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow, National Ports Policy recommends that these are transferred to more appropriate local authority-led governance structures. The longer term development of these ports is best placed within their regional and local communities to allow both develop in a manner that is mutually beneficial. Two of these five ports, Wicklow and Drogheda, have already transferred to the control of the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

As required by the Public Spending Code, the NTA in due course will also progress the relevant appraisal processes and value for money tests before Exchequer resources are finally committed. </p>  <p>  In relation to the planned capacity of the new Metro North scheme, the 2015 Final/North Dublin Study, which recommended new Metro North as the optimum transport solution on the Swords/Airport/City Centre corridor, identified that the scheme &ldquo;has significant capacity to allow for potential future growth&rdquo;.  It is noted also that the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s results from the 2016 census align with the population growth projections used in the Final/North Dublin Study. </p>  <p>  The design and planning work being undertaken at present on the new Metro North project, will continue to use the most up-to-date information available on population and employment projections to ensure that the final design and service pattern is correctly calibrated to fully meet the transport needs of the corridor. </p>  <p>  I am advised that there is no active development levy scheme currently in place for new Metro North at this time. </p>  <p>  Of the previous expenditure incurred on the original Metro North scheme, it is anticipated that a significant proportion of this investment will be of value in the finalisation of the new Metro North project; however, the extent of that will only be determined when the current option analysis and selection work have been progressed.</p></reply>

Its core objective is to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services. In keeping with National Ports Policy, the provision of adequate and efficient capacity into the future is a crucial strategic objective.  A copy of is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at </p><p>The planning and development of large-scale infrastructure such as commercial port development requires significant organisational, operational and financial resources. It is important that bodies bringing forward significant port capacity projects have the resources required. Therefore, Government, as outlined in National Ports Policy, requires Tier 1 and Tier 2 ports of national significance to lead the response in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s future port capacity requirements. At present in line with this policy there are major redevelopment projects taking place at Tier 1 ports across the country, at Dublin Port and two ports outside of Dublin, the Port of Cork and Shannon-Foynes Port.</p><p>The Dublin Port Company Masterplan 2012 &ndash; 2040, which was published in 2012, sets out a vision for the development and operation of Dublin Port for the 30 years up to 2040. The Masterplan identifies specific uses for land within the port estate. While the key focus of the Masterplan is on the infrastructural development of the port and the delivery of the capacity required to service the import and export needs of the Irish economy it also contains a strong commitment to rebuild the linkages between the Port and the City. </p><p>The core principles of the Masterplan were endorsed by the Government in the National Ports Policy and the continued commercial development of Dublin Port Company is a key strategic objective of this Policy. Earlier this year, Dublin Port Company carried out a first review of the Masterplan. The results the public consulatation held as part of this review will help inform the revised Masterplan which is due to be published later in 2017. The Masterplan and the review are available to view on the Company&rsquo;s website at </p></reply>

On Sunday the 15th of October at 19.41, an announcement regarding the closure of childcare facilities was released on the PIP Portal. The PIP Portal is an IT system that enables communication with all 4500 services funded by DCYA. Operated by Pobal, DCYAs funding and administration intermediary, PIP is used for all important communications with childcare service providers. This announcement was based on the advice of the National Emergency Coordination Committee. It advised that childcare providers should make safety their priority and that the Department would continue to fund Government schemes despite closure on Monday 16th. </p>  <p>  A press release was also issued and shared with key stakeholders who could further share on social media and other platforms This information was also included in the statement released from the National Emergency Coordination Group on Severe Weather on Sunday the 15th of October. The relevant section from this statement is as follows (bold added); </p>  <p>"Because of the duty of care owed to children and to avoid the risk arising from travelling, the Department of Education and Skills is instructing all schools to act on the Department&lsquo;s advice and remain closed. Cr&egrave;ches and Montessori facilities should also remain closed tomorrow." </p>  <p>  This statement was widely discussed and publicised across all news media platforms and social media networks. On Monday 16 Oct, DCYA released a further statement on the PIP Portal and through the media advising all service again that the safety of children, staff and parents should be the primary consideration and, for services which could not reopen, funding would not be affected for Government schemes on Tuesday 17th of October. </p>  <p>  Further communications took place with various organisations including City and County Childcare Committees and these were shared on social media.</p></reply>

The LIS roads were completed through a concentrated effort over a relatively short period of time. </p>  <p>  In September of this year, I re-launched the Local Improvement Scheme, with an allocation of &euro;10 million for 2017.  Funding was allocated to Local Authorities on the basis of listings of projects which they had indicated could be completed by the end of the year.  The amount requested by Local Authorities greatly exceeded the budget available for the scheme this year and it is a matter for the Local Authorities to prioritise the specific roads on which works will be carried out before the end of the year within the allocation assigned to them.   </p>  <p>  Payments will be made to Local Authorities only when they have certified that at least 50% of the works had been completed and that the works will be fully completed before the end of the year.  The payment arrangements take account of the fact that Local Authorities would not have been in a positon to factor the scheme in to their cash-flow requirements at the start of the year.    </p>  <p>  All expenditure by my Department to date has been fully sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and all future payments will similarly require sanction and will be in line with public financial procedures.  </p>  <p>  Expenditure under all of my Department's rural support schemes is being monitored on an on-going basis and inspections of both projects and associated administrative files will be carried out as necessary to verify satisfactory completion of the LIS and other schemes.</p></reply>

The CSP works on a social-enterprise model which means that it does not fully fund contract holders but requires that they generate revenue by charging fees or raising funds.  All CSP recipients are obliged to meet these criteria.  These social enterprises also remain responsible for their own budgets and financial liabilities.</p><p>The organisation referred to by the Deputy received funding under the CSP for one manager and two full-time equivalent (FTE) posts. This equates to funding in the order of &euro;70,000 per annum.</p><p>The organisation submitted their business plan in 2016, as part of the normal re-contracting process.  During this process, it was found that the service did not meet the required standards  in terms of strategic fit, value for money and the demonstration of the continued need for the service. </p><p>Overall, the review found that the service:</p><p>- is primarily meeting the needs of a membership base, the majority of which are private businesses.  This is not a priority for continued funding under the CSP which is focused on groups that provide services to specific disadvantaged groups, rather than private businesses;</p><p>- has low levels of foot-fall and opening hours when compared to other tourism operations supported by the CSP.  Given the service primarily benefits private business, rather that CSP target groups, the funding provided to the organisation does not represent value for money under the Programme; and  </p><p>- has not adequately and clearly articulated what the key needs of their clients are and how they propose to meet them, particularly in terms of the target groups of the CSP.</p><p>As a result of these findings, the service was recommended to exit the CSP on 30 June 2017.</p><p>This decision was appealed to Pobal on 29 November 2016.  An independent review was carried out which upheld the original decision. This was communicated to the organisation on 20 December 2016. </p><p>Discussions were held between Pobal and the organisation in January 2017, outlining options for alternative funding post programme exit in June 2017.</p><p>In February 2017 the organisation requested an extension to their contract until 30 September 2017 to allow them to complete their summer schedule and a timely wind-up of operations.  This extension was facilitated and approved by my Department and an addendum to their contract was issued on 21 February 2017.</p><p>This organisation has now exhausted the appeals process for the CSP.  For the reasons outlined above, I would now urge them to explore other sources of funding, outside of the CSP, in order to continue operating.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The definition of a stillbirth contained in that Act was carried forward to the Civil Registration Act 2004. The registration of stillbirths is provided for in section 28 of the 2004 Act. </p>  <p>  When the 1994 Act was introduced it was primarily to afford comfort to the bereaved parents.  For this reason it was felt that the definition of a stillbirth should be as wide as possible, consistent with accepted medical norms.</p>  <p>  During the passage of the 1994 Act detailed consideration was given, by the Oireachtas, as to what the most appropriate definition of a stillbirth should be.  It was decided to use the broadest definition available to allow as many registrations as possible.  The definition that was agreed on is based on the international medical meaning of the term &lsquo;stillborn child&rsquo; The definition of a &ldquo;stillborn child&rdquo; is contained in section 2(1) of the 2004 Act and provides that a stillborn child &ldquo;means a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The definition of &lsquo;stillborn&rsquo; varies from country to country. Some countries use gestational age only, while others use weight, or a combination of both. In Ireland, in order to broaden the definition, either criterion can be used.</p>  <p>  For international comparison purposes the World Health Organisation recommends that a stillbirth be defined as a baby born with no signs of life at or after 28 weeks' gestation.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that stillbirths which occurred prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act may be registered, providing the stillborn child fulfils the criteria as set out in section 2(1) of the 2004 Act.</p>  <p>  While acknowledging that the loss of an unborn child is very sad for the family concerned there are no plans to amend the legislation as the definition of a stillbirth contained in the 2004 Act is consistent with accepted medical norms.</p></reply>

Capital includes moneys on hands or deposited in financial institutions while property includes the value of other assets such as bonds and equities as well as houses and other premises.  Property such as the family home or a premises used by a person in carrying out a business is not liable for assessment. </p><p>The capital assessment method for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and most social assistance schemes (such as farm assist, one parent family payment and the state pension non-contributory) involves disregarding an initial amount of capital/savings and applying an increasing notional weekly value for amounts in excess of the disregarded amount, as outlined in the table.  The same assessment of capital applies to capital/savings in the name of the claimant and his or her spouse/partner.</p><p><i>Table: Social Welfare Capital Means Assessment (excluding Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Disability Allowance)</i><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The weekly entitlement of the claimant is the maximum weekly rate of payment for the person less the means calculated.  For a couple with no dependent children, the current rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) is &euro;321.10 per week (i.e. &euro;193 per week personal rate and &euro;128.10 increase for a qualified adult).  For each dependent child, the rate payable increases by &euro;29.80 per week.  The amount of JA payable is the rate of JA for the relevant family (i.e. personal rate, increase for a qualified adult, if relevant, and any increases for qualified children) minus the means available to the couple.</p><p>This means that a couple on JA can have &euro;20,000 in savings and be assessed with nil means from capital and receive the maximum weekly rate of JA, while a couple with savings of &euro;30,000 would be assessed with &euro;10 of capital means.  A couple with savings of &euro;100,000 and no other means would be assessed with weekly means of &euro;270 and still receive a payment of &euro;51.10 per week.  In this regard, a couple with no dependent children can have savings in excess of &euro;110,000 and still receive a minimal payment of JA.</p><p>I was pleased to announce on Budget Day last week that there will be a &euro;5 increase in the weekly personal rates of payment, with proportionate increases for qualified adults from the last week of March 2018.  In this regard, the weekly personal rate of JA will increase to &euro;198 per week and the increase for qualified adults will increase to &euro;131.40 per week.  In addition, the increase for qualified children will also rise by &euro;2 to &euro;31.80 per child per week from the end of March.  </p></reply>

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts. </p>  <p>  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p>  <p>  In August 2017, I published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings where concerns arise.  The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. In addition, the Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  In response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, on 27 June 2017, I tasked the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.  The Task Force is currently reviewing and re-appraising existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety. </p>  <p>  Work has been on-going in my Department to review Technical Guidance Document (TGD) B &ndash; Fire (2006) and a new Part B/TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017.  This Volume 2 applies to dwelling houses only. Important revisions in the TGD B Volume 2 include enhanced provision for fire detection and alarm systems in dwelling houses, guidance on fire safety in community dwelling houses, guidance on timber frame construction, including new provisions in respect of timber frame party walls, enhanced provisions in respect of loft conversions, new provisions for galleries in dwelling houses and other general updates.</p>  <p>  In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 9 of 2014), which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p>  <p>  A Certificate of Compliance on Completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier. This must be accompanied by plans and documentation to show how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan, as implemented.</p>  <p>  At the end of May 2017, the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing and this Bill has now been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Once it is enacted the Bill will provide consumers who engage a registered builder with the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator and will complement the reforms which have been made through the Building Control Amendment Regulations and contribute to the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.</p></reply>

This is due to end in early November, following which submissions will be reviewed with a view to finalising the NPF before the end of the year. </p><p>In the preparation of the Framework, securing better planning and development outcomes from the form of Ireland's urban development patterns was highlighted as one of the most significant national development challenges in terms of a move away from an extensive, medium- to low-density form of development that is very difficult and costly to service from an infrastructural development perspective, towards a more compact urban development based approach. </p><p>Accordingly. National Policy Objective 3b states: </p><p><i>&lsquo;At least half (50%) of all new homes in the five cities and immediately adjoining suburban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford would be delivered within the built-up envelope of existing urban settlements&rsquo;.</i></p><p>The practical effect of this is that at least 50% of all new residential development targeted for each of the five cities would occur within the above defined areas, which in the case of Dublin and all four other cities, is the City and suburbs as defined and mapped by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). In relation to Dublin, this does not equate to Dublin County but in broad terms, includes the contiguous built-up area and associated in-fill and new development areas.  This contiguous built-up area also includes some lands in the counties around Dublin.</p><p>Outside each of the five cities and their suburbs, it is a further target that at least 30% of new residential development would be accommodated within the existing built-up envelope i.e. town and suburbs, of other urban areas, some of which may be in surrounding counties. </p><p>With regard to the meaning of &lsquo;immediately adjoining suburban areas&rsquo;, this relates to the area within the existing built-up envelope of all sizes of urban settlement, as defined and mapped by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in line with UN criteria i.e. having a minimum of 50 occupied dwellings, with a maximum distance between any dwelling and the building closest to it of 100 metres, and where there is evidence of an urban centre (shop, school etc.).</p><p>Moreover, National Policy Objective 8 states:</p><p><i>&lsquo;Ensure that the targeted pattern of population growth of Ireland&rsquo;s cities and large towns to 2040 is proportionate, in accordance with the targets set out in Table 3.1.&rsquo;</i></p><p>The suburbs for each city under National Policy Objective 8 are as defined by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), i.e. in line with UN criteria referred to above.  For development purposes, they must also include immediately adjoining i.e. contiguous, zoned development land that would, if developed, form part of an updated city/town and suburban area in accordance with the CSO definition. </p><p>Given that a majority of &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; development outside the built-up envelope of an urban settlement occurs at the suburban edge, the definition of the CSO is dynamic and changes in relation to each Census of Population.  </p></reply>

In addition, the processes to develop the supporting Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies in each of the three regions has already begun and this work is targeted for completion before the end of 2018.</p></reply>

Section 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act), provides for the preparation of supplementary development contribution schemes in order to facilitate a particular public infrastructure service or project that benefits development in the area. Such public infrastructure services and projects include rail, light rail metro or other large public infrastructure projects.</p>  <p>  As the original Metro North project was to traverse the functional areas of Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, supplementary development contribution schemes were adopted under section 49 of the Act by both Councils in 2007, and subsequently revised in 2013, with a view to facilitating the project. </p>  <p>  However, the National Transport Authority (NTA) notified both local authorities on 29 September 2015 of a Government decision not to proceed with the original Metro North project and to instead proceed with a revised Metro North project, entitled "new Metro North".  As the new Metro North will differ from the original Metro North project, the NTA advised both local authorities that their existing section 49 supplementary development contribution schemes in respect of the original Metro North project should cease and be revoked. Both Councils subsequently commenced a process to cease their existing Section 49 supplementary development contribution schemes for Metro North and to refund any contributions received under their schemes in respect of the project.</p>  <p>  The NTA is the sanctioning authority for public transport projects in the Greater Dublin Area, and would, accordingly under the provisions of the Act, be consulted in the adoption of such section 49 supplementary development contribution schemes. It is ultimately a matter for the local authorities concerned to decide on the introduction of supplementary development schemes in their respective functional areas. The adoption of such schemes is a reserved function of the elected members of each planning authority and I have no function in this regard. </p>  <p>  I am informed that there is currently no active development contribution scheme in place for new Metro North.  When details of the new project are formally notified to the two Councils, including details of the appropriate catchment area to be serviced by the project, the process of adopting new supplementary development contribution schemes will commence and contributions will be applied on the completion of that process. </p></reply>

National Policy Objective 12 highlights potential mechanisms to support urban infill/brownfield development targets.  These may include the establishment of a national land development agency, and if appropriate, the broadening of the applicability of compulsory purchase (CPO) legislation in certain circumstances. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that a large number of State bodies and authorities already have CPO powers, many of which are underpinned by different statutes.  Considering the number of statutes involved, the complexity of the various pieces of legislation, and the 2015 judgment by Supreme Court in respect of a case in Co. Kildare, any review of CPO powers will be a significant task and will require detailed legal input to appropriately balance the constitutional property rights against the wider public interest. </p>  <p>  In addition, the complexity of current statute law governing CPOs has been acknowledged by the Law Reform Commission which has begun a project on reform of the law of compulsory acquisition of land, as part of the Commission&rsquo;s current Fourth Programme of Law Reform. This project will explore the consolidation, clarification and reform of the rules and principles on compulsory acquisition of land, with the aim of putting in place a fair, effective and efficient system. Among the matters included in the project will be:</p>  <p>  -  simplification, consolidation and codification of the law;</p>  <p>  -  the principles for the assessment of compensation on the acquisition of land or interests in land;</p>  <p>  -  time limits for implementation of a CPO; and</p>  <p>  -  submissions from third parties whose land is not being acquired. </p>  <p>  The Commission intends to publish a consultative Issues Paper, which will describe the current law and seek views from interested parties through targeted questions around how the law might be reformed, in the coming months.  In this context, the outcomes of this LRC project will inform the assessment in my Department as to whether and what further review of CPO provisions is warranted.  </p>  <p>  Further to the above work being conducted by the LRC, and taking account of advice from the Attorney General, I also intend to engage directly with local authorities, who have practical, on-the-ground, operational knowledge and expertise on the CPO process within their own areas, and who may be able to identify practical measures or immediate legal reforms that could be taken in the short term to improve the existing processes.</p></reply>

It set the priorities for the utility to 2021 and underpins the transformation plan for the water sector to a single utility model. The plan was considered by Government and was approved subject to budgetary and regulatory review.</p>  <p>  Since 2013, working through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with the Local Authorities, Irish Water has made significant progress in establishing the utility capability, which has included investing over &euro;2 billion in the system to date.  Over the past year, significant design phase work has been undertaken on the development of a transformation plan, in line with the Business Plan objectives.  Flowing from this, I have been informed by Ervia (which has responsibility for Irish Water), that they consider that the public water system will benefit significantly by greater integration of operations into the single utility.  Consequently, the Ervia Board has agreed in principle not to renew the SLAs beyond 2025 (when they are due to end) and to move to a full integrated public utility operations model.  The Water Services Acts already provide the necessary protections for terms and conditions, and pensions of local authority staff working under the SLAs in such circumstances.  It is the intention of Ervia to work with local authorities to manage this change within the life of the current Business Plan (i.e. by end of 2021). </p>  <p>  A process of engagement with local authorities on the proposed next steps on the transformation plan has now commenced.

My Department subsequently wrote to all Chief Executives on 25 August 2017, providing advice on the broad structure that such Action Plans should take. </p>  <p>  Supplementary to my letter to Chief Executives on 2 August last, I also announced a range of other initiatives and actions to be taken to quickly facilitate the delivery of vacant homes back into use:</p>  <p>  - a dedicated Empty Homes Unit to be established within my Department to drive and co-ordinate actions at central and local level and to support local authorities in their actions;</p>  <p>  - all Chief Executives were requested to designate vacant home officers in their local authorities to examine Census 2016 and other vacancy data in order to identify - through their Vacant Homes Action Plans - priority "vacant hot-spot areas" and properties that can be quickly brought back into use;</p>  <p>  - all local authorities were requested to maximise the quick turnaround of their vacant social housing stock between lettings through more efficient ongoing maintenance and upgrading of their properties so as to minimize "down-time" and quicker identification of new tenants through, for example, the choice-based letting initiative; and</p>  <p>  - prioritising the development and adoption of exempted development planning regulations to allow the change of use of vacant commercial and over-the-shop premises to residential use without having to go through the planning process. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has a number of funding schemes in place, particularly the Repair and Leasing Scheme and the Buy and Renew Scheme, to support local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies in bringing vacant housing stock into use for social housing purposes.</p>  <p>  Furthermore my Department has recently established a multi-disciplinary working group to prepare additional building control guidance for local authorities and the construciton sector with a view to better facilitating the reuse or development of under-used or vacant buildings within the context of the existing building control regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to engage on an ongoing basis with local authorities, including the four Dublin local authorities, with a view to progressing measures to bring as many vacant and underutilised properties as possible back into use.</p></reply>

An emergency in this respect is an unanticipated event, such as storm damage, that would render a caravan/mobile uninhabitable or dangerous to live in.  Any request from housing authorities for such funding will be urgently considered.  </p></reply>

It was open to all local authorities to apply for funding towards the capital cost of public infrastructure, which, when provided, would secure the early delivery of additional housing at considerable scale and more affordable price points, with developments in excess of 500 units in the Dublin area, or in excess of 200 units in areas outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  21 local authorities submitted a total of 74 proposals in October 2016. On 28 March 2017, I announced funding for 34 projects under LIHAF. The total cost of these projects is &euro;226.5 million, of which &euro;169.7 million is to be funded under LIHAF with local authorities funding the remaining &euro;56.8 million. These public infrastructure projects will be key to the delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years, with a longer term projection of up to 70,000 units as the selected sites are fully built out.  </p>  <p>  Louth County Council submitted three projects for consideration under LIHAF. LIHAF funding was approved for an access road in Newtown, Drogheda in the amount of &euro;1.22m and an access road in Mount Avenue, Dundalk in the amount of &euro;3.3m.  However, while the Port Access Northern Cross Route (PANCR) in Drogheda was one of a number of proposals that was assessed as meriting funding, it was not possible to include the project in the March 2017 approvals, within the overall level of funding available.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2018, I announced an additional &euro;50 million funding which will be available, from 2019 on, for a second call under LIHAF and which will again be subject to matching funding at 25% by local authorities.  This will facilitate more infrastructure to unlock further sites and activate more housing supply.  A further call for proposals under LIHAF is likely early in 2018 and it will be open to all local authorities, including Louth County Council, to submit new projects or resubmit previously unsuccessful projects, such as the Port Access Northern Cross Route project in Drogheda, for consideration at that time.</p></reply>

Critically, &euro;5.35 billion in exchequer investment has been secured to support its implementation and to deliver 47,000 social housing units through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period to 2021. This level of national funding to implement Rebuilding Ireland's targets means that funding is available to all local authorities to advance their housing delivery. Within the overall 21,000 social housing solutions targeted for delivery this year, some 4,500 of these will be delivered through new builds/acquisitions/refurbishments and a significant proportion of these will involve new construction.</p><p>Louth County Council has an ambitious pipeline of construction projects in development to meet the social housing needs of Drogheda and the rest of the county. Details of these projects are available at the following link: . </p><p>These projects are funded under a range of different initiatives such as local authority construction, turnkey developments, rapid delivery, regeneration programmes and construction and turnkey developments by Approved Housing Bodies.  The precise timing for the advancement of each of these projects, including completion dates and tenanting of these projects is a matter in the first place for Louth County Council </p><p>Further project approvals are being added to the construction programme as they are developed by Louth County Council and Approved Housing Bodies, updated details of which will be published on a regular basis. I am keen that all local authorities advance their social housing projects as speedily as possible and I have assured them that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.</p><p>In addition, there are also a range of other social housing delivery methods that are being utilised alongside traditional construction, including harnessing vacant properties, purchasing suitable units from the market, and securing new properties under long-term lease agreements, the Rental Accommodation Scheme and the Housing Assistance Payment, all of which will be used to meet the 21,000 social housing solutions targeted for delivery this year.</p><p>Details on the number of social housing properties constructed, purchased and leased by local authorities and approved housing bodies, for letting to those on their social housing waiting lists, are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p></reply>

Equipment priorities for the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process. </p>  <p>  In this context the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks. The tender competition for the procurement of the three new aircraft is underway and the cost will be determined by the outcome of the tender competition.</p>  <p>  The Defence Capital envelope of &euro;416m for the period 2018 &ndash; 2021 will enable further investment in major equipment platforms, including the replacement of the Cessna aircraft. </p></reply>
