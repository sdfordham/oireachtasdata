The public consultation for these Plans closed on 28th October 2016.  The draft plans will be finalised taking on board the comments received.</p>  <p>  In the AFAs of Ballinamore and Ballyconnell the detailed CFRAM analysis has determined that there is currently a very low level of flood risk from rivers and/or the sea in these areas.</p>  <p>  Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address.  In August 2016 I wrote to all Local Authorities reminding them of the availability of the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme and encouraged them to make the best possible use of the scheme to deal with localised fluvial and coastal flooding problems that may be eligible for funding under the scheme in their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the Flood Risk Management Plans. </p></reply>

From 1 November 2013 pre and post-2011 pay scales were merged into a single consolidated scale applicable to each grade.  Generally, the third point of 1 November 2013 payscale is equivalent to the first point of scale of the pre 2011 scale.  Guidelines in relation to the merging of the scales are available on my Departments website </p><p>Any further remuneration adjustment, for any group of public servants including new entrants, can be examined under the framework of the Lansdowne Road Agreement but must also be considered in the context of the total cost of the agreement (&euro;844m) and the total cost of the outstanding FEMPI restoration post Lansdowne Road (&euro;1.4bn).</p><p>Acting within these constraints, the Agreement has provided the flexability to address particular sectoral issues such as the restoration of supervision and substitution payments and new entrant payments in the Education Sector and the restoration of rent allowances to new entrant firefighters and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-24a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112400061#WRA02300"><p>In relation to the unwinding of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) measures for low earners, the Deputy will be aware that the application of the FEMPI pay reductions were extremely progressive, with pay reductions ranging from 5% at lower pay levels to 29% at higher pay levels. </p>  <p>  Again the measures applied under the phased unwinding of the FEMPI reductions through the LRA were also progressive - it provided the greatest benefit at the fastest pace to lower paid public servants by:</p>  <p>  - exclusively targeting those earning under &euro;65,000 for increases in pay - ranging from &euro;1,500 for those earning &euro;20,000 to &euro;1,000 for those earning &euro;60,000.</p>  <p>  - utilising increases in the exemption threshold of the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) to maximise the benefit to low paid workers.  All statutory deductions other than tax are made before PRD is taken from salary, therefore, a reduction of an amount in PRD will benefit the employee to that amount, less PAYE.  For a person on the lower 20% tax rate, a &euro;100 reduction in PRD gives a benefit of &euro;80.</p>  <p>   Consequently the percentage benefit of the commitments in the Lansdowne Road Agreement is clearly weighted to lower paid public servants - those on &euro;20,000 will benefit by 8.1% of gross salary. </p>  <p>  As a result public servants earning under &euro;24,000 will be fully restored under the LRA, while those earning under &euro;30,000 will have approx 80% of their FEMPI reductions unwound.  In contrast,  public servants who are earning &euro;70,000 will receive 32% of their FEMPI reduction or those earning &euro;120,000 who will receive 28% of the FEMPI reduction that was applied to their remuneration.  </p>  <p>  Any further FEMPI adjustment measures post the Lansdowne Road Agreement will be collectively negotiated with the relevant union interests at the appropriate time and will have to be sustainable and affordable.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-24a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112400061#WRA02600"><p>The Capital Plan published last year set out a six year framework for infrastructural investment in Ireland.  The scale and profile of the Exchequer component of the Plan was developed with reference to the Government's medium term economic growth forecasts and assessment of Ireland's fiscal targets at the time.   </p>  <p>  Since then, the current Government has made clear that the existing Capital Plan is the starting point for increased investment in priority areas into the future.  This is demonstrated by the additional &euro;5.14 billion now committed to capital investment over the period of the Capital Plan.  I have recently announced the commencement of a Review of the Plan for the allocation of these substantial additional  resources for capital investment to Government priorities. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy has indicated, Exchequer capital expenditure will amount to 2.2% of GDP in 2021, or 2.7% of GNP, a better metric for the Irish economy.  However, when the State Owned Sector investment of &euro;14&frac12; billion is included, along with a third phase of PPPs, total state backed investment will reach 3.7% of GNP in 2021.</p>  <p>  While representing capital investment as a percentage of GDP tends to be used as a means to make international comparisons on the topic, in Ireland's case this ratio may not give an accurate reflection of the level of investment taking place.  Given the exceptional nature of recent increases in GDP and GNP, we must be very cautious in how and when we use such figures and, if necessary, use additional indicators, such as capital expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure.  Using that measure, Gross Voted Capital expenditure is set to increase to over 11% of Total Voted Expenditure by 2021, or almost 75% higher than in 2016.  </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to increased capital investment in the coming years to underpin the economy's medium-term growth potential and continued employment creation.  The funding of our capital investment plans must be securely based on sustainable economic growth and must be consistent with the requirement of responsible fiscal policy.  This is the clear lesson from the unsustainable expenditure policies that preceded our fiscal collapse.  It also reinforces the importance of ensuring that we maintain a strict focus on securing value-for-money for the Exchequer rather than see the State's investment eroded by tender price inflation and by projects that do not meet cost-benefit tests.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-24a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112400061#WRA02900"><p>Public Procurement is governed by the EU Treaty, EU Directives, Regulations and national guidelines.  These set down rules whereby contracting authorities must award contracts under procedures designed to achieve value for public money in an open, transparent and non discriminatory competitive process.  In addition to achieving value for money, the Government is also keen to explore the scope for supporting wider policy objectives including the use of social and environmental sustainability clauses in public contracts.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the revised EU Directives governing public procurement were transposed into Irish law last May.  There is now greater scope and legal clarity in relation to the use of social and environmental criteria.  These criteria can be inserted at relevant stages in the procurement process including the award criteria provided that they are linked to the subject matter of the contract and are contract specific. </p>  <p>  The inclusion of environmental clauses in the procurement process is most suited to situations where the benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority's policy or strategic plan.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social or environmental clause.</p>  <p>  However, while the Government is keen to explore the potential for including social and environmental clauses in public contracts, it should be noted that these are complex considerations.   Account must also be taken to ensure that value for money is not adversely affected, additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers, contracts are of a minimum scale to absorb the increased administrative requirements, and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during the execution of the contract.  In this context also, care must be taken not to disproportionately impact on SME's bidding for public contracts.</p></reply>

This ensures that the impact of policy proposals on gender equality, rural communities, North-South/East-West Relations, employment, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion, people with disabilities and industry costs are taken into account.</p><p>In addition, the Departments of Finance and Social Protection undertake distributional analyses to assess the impact of the main tax and social welfare measures using the ESRI SWITCH model.  The most recent SWITCH model analysis, conducted by the ESRI and published in the Irish Times in October, found that the greatest gains in Budget 2017 are in the lowest income quintile, driven largely by the welfare rate increases in the Budget. </p><p>This year, in order to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of budget measures on household living standards, my department has undertaken initial work in the area of Social Impact Assessment (SIA).  The SIA framework is defined as an evidence-based methodology which attempts to assess the impact of policy on households' financial positions.  The assessment can be quantitative, measuring the change in incomes as a result of policy, or qualitative offering a description of how policies affect households' financial positions.</p><p>A series of three papers were published alongside the Expenditure Report on the Budget 2017 website .  These papers were prepared by members of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) and include impact assessments of Targeted Childcare Schemes and the General Medical Services Scheme.  In the future, the aim will be to expand the assessment, in so far as is possible within the available data constraints, to demonstrate the impact of particular policy measures across the income distribution.  </p><p>Overall, the analysis feeding into the decision making process has been improving over recent years and I envisage this positive dynamic continuing in the future.</p></reply>

The Agreement provides for sustainable pay increases through adjustment of the existing measures under the Financial Emergency (FEMPI) measures legislation.  The estimated cost of the implementation of the LRA is &euro;267m in 2016, &euro;290m in 2017, &euro;287m in 2018 or a cumulative &euro;844m out to 2018.  This represents a considerable investment by the Government in negotiated pay increases for public servants.  Any further adjustment measures underr FEMPI  will be collectively negotiated with the relevant union interests at the appropriate time and will have to be sustainable and affordable.   </p>  <p>  The 10% reductions in starting pay for certain new entrants were introduced by the then Government in January 2011 as part of the National Recovery Plan in order to reduce the Public Service Pay Bill.  Terms and conditions of employment for public servants are also set by reference to legislation including the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts and through negotiation and agreement under Collective Agreements such as the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) and the Lansdowne Ro ad Agreement (LRA). </p>  <p>  The issue of addressing the difference in incremental salary scales between those public servants, who entered public service employment since 2011 and those who entered before that date was addressed with the relevant union interests under the provisions of the Haddington Road Agreement.  Any further consideration of remuneration adjustment for any group of public servants, including issues relating to more recently recruited public servants, fall to be examined within the provisions of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Agreement provides the framework and is flexible enough to address particular sectoral issues such as the restoration of supervision and substitution payments and new entrant payments in the Education Sector and the restoration of rent allowances to new entrant firefighters and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

To date none of these factors have lessened appreciably, while the risks of international economy instability have, if anything, increased. </p>  <p>  In this context the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA), which provides a negotiated pathway for public service pay increases through a phased partial unwinding of the FEMPI measures at a full year cost of  &euro;844m in 2018, represents a considerable investment in public service remuneration.  A comprehensive Collective Agreement of this kind allows for strong fiscal planning, with budget allocations ring-fenced within multi-annual expenditure ceilings and pay increases taking an appropriate share of available fiscal space.  This phased and sustainable programme of pay increases underpins the fiscal targets in Budget 2017 and our international commitments to have a prudent fiscal policy under the Stability and Growth Pact.  Any further adjustments in the application of the FEMPI measures will be negotiated with public service staff representatives through a further Collective Agreement that is sustainable and affordable at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

To ensure that these targets are met, managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.  In this regard, the voted expenditure report published with the end-October Exchequer statement outlines that gross voted expenditure of &euro;44,219 million to end-October was &euro;795 million (1.8%) below profile.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Expenditure Report 2017, total gross voted expenditure for 2016 is now estimated at &euro;56.1 billion.  This is 0.6 per cent higher than the level set out in the Estimates for 2016.  This increase in expenditure reflects an additional &euro;200 million of capital funding for necessary repair work to transport infrastructure arising from flood damage at the start of the year and expenditure arising on school building works.  In addition, an amount of &euro;220 million is included to fund a Christmas Bonus to long-term Social Welfare recipients.  In line with previous years, it is anticipated that the additional cost of providing this bonus will be offset by year-end savings across a number of Departments.  The Christmas Bonus will be funded through both voted expenditure and the Social Insurance Fund.  In addition, since publication of the Expenditure Report 2017, given the need to respond proactively to growing uncertainties for Irish based enterprise, additional funding is to be allocated to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in 2016.  This additional funding, which by fast-tracking the delivery of certain spending programmes in 2016 through an increased 2016 allocation, should provide the space for increased spending on Brexit initiatives in 2017 within the allocation for 2017 agreed at Budget time.  All of these additional amounts will be  reflected in the Supplementary Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Given the scale of the under-spend versus profile at the end of October and the level of savings surrendered to the Exchequer at the end of 2015, it is expected that all Supplementary Estimates can be accommodated within the overall gross voted expenditure amount of &euro;56.1 billion set out in the Expenditure Report 2017.</p></reply>

The key task, however, will be to recommend how the remaining unallocated capital funding should be allocated over the period of the plan, having regard to the priority areas identified in the Government's Programme. </p>  <p>  The review will not entail a fundamental revision of the Capital Plan, given the significant analysis that was put into developing the existing Capital Plan, which was of course published just one year ago and the progress in delivery achieved to date.  As would be expected in terms of any review process, the review will take into consideration economic, fiscal and other developments since the Capital Plan was originally agreed by Government.  This will help underpin, the allocation of the additional capital funding resources to where they would be expected to have greatest impact in terms of Government priorities.</p>  <p>  It will also be very important to ensure that these allocations are informed by value-for-money considerations in line with the requirements of my Department's Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  Projected capital allocations out to 2021 are as set out in the Estimates for 2017.  As the Deputy will appreciate increased investment in public capital infrastructure has a major role in enhancing the economy's growth potential which underpins the revenue base required to fund priority public services.</p></reply>

This is in comparison to three-year expenditure growth figures of between 26% and 57% that were experienced in the 1999 to 2008 period.</p></reply>

This means that only one quarter of an annual increase in capital investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space, which allows for the front loading of capital formation increases.   </p>  <p>  This flexibility has been utilised by the Government to prioritise funding for capital investment.  The results of this prioritisation are shown in Tables 4 and 6 of the Expenditure Report 2017, which detail the Exchequer capital ceilings for 2016 to 2019.  These tables illustrate that the allocation for public capital investment will grow from around &euro;4.2 billion in 2016 to over &euro;6 billion in 2019, a 46% increase in public capital investment in just three years.    </p>  <p>  The Capital Plan published in 2015 outlines the framework and broad direction for investment priorities.  As set out in the Expenditure Report 2017, there will be a review of the Capital Plan beginning immediately with the aim of presenting a revised programme of capital investment in the first half of next year.  In setting out proposed allocations for each Department in 2018 and 2019, the review will take into account, commitments already contained in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  </p>  <p>  Flexibility within the fiscal rules for growth enhancing capital investment will ensure sustainable increases in capital funding, which will help to achieve our social objectives while maintaining the health and sustainability of the public finances.</p></reply>

During this period, many elements of the Outline Implementation Plan for the 2004 Flood Risk Management Policy that involved parties in addition to the OPW were undertaken and/or completed including the publication of Planning guidelines, actions in respect of forecasting and the launch of the website resources , and . </p><p>The Group has met eight times since it was reconvened in July 2015.  The Group recently presented for consideration and agreement by Government an interim report setting out progress on its work and making appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government at this time.  The report has been approved by the Government and is available on the OPW website, </p><p>The Government has agreed to key recommendations of the Group to introduce a targeted Voluntary Homeowner Relocation Scheme for those properties worst affected by last Winter&rsquo;s flooding, to further examine the feasibility of any future once-off targeted scheme for Voluntary Farm Building Relocation and to continue the current strategy for improving the availability of flood insurance cover by prioritising spending on flood relief measures by OPW and relevant local authorities and improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry. </p><p>The National CFRAM Steering Group was formed in May 2009 to provide a forum to promote communication and coordination among key stakeholders in the implementation of the EU 'Floods' Directive, and for these stakeholders to provide their advice, input and knowledge on the overall direction and outputs of the National CFRAM Programme and related &lsquo;Floods&rsquo; Directive matters.  The Steering Group met on six occasions between May 2009 and November 2010 and the work was informed by the Pilot CFRAM Studies and the policy direction of the Interdepartmental Group.</p><p>During this period, the Steering Group provided input into:</p><p>- The Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment that provided the process to designate in early 2012 the 300 Areas for Further Assessment for consideration by the CFRAM Programme.</p><p>- The preparation of the CFRAM Brief that provided, inter alia, the appointment of engineering consultations through a procurement process and the appropriate governance structures for each of the six study areas.</p><p>- The preparation of the Statutory Instrument to transpose the EU 'Floods' Directive.</p><p>Robust governance structures were then established for each of the six CFRAM Study areas and these continue to meet on a regular basis.  The Steering Group was reconvened in November 2014 when the draft maps were being prepared for public consultation.  A further meeting took place in 2016 prior to the consultation on the draft Flood Risk Management Plans.  To date, the Steering Group has met on eight occasions and there have been over 250 meetings of the Project-level Steering and Progress Groups.  Given the study based governance structures, the OPW, as lead and competent authority for flood risk management in Ireland took responsibility for oversight and co-ordination of the CFRAM programme. </p><p>The Flood Risk Management Plans are a major step forward to help Government make informed investment decisions on flood risk management.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue support of flood relief is underlined in the provision of &euro;430 million to Flood Risk Management in the Capital Investment Plan 2016 to 2021.</p><p>Since last Winter, the OPW has accelerated its resources to complete major flood defence schemes.  This year there is a record of 12 major schemes at construction and a further 23 at design development stage.  These include schemes in Bandon, Crossmolina and Claregalway.  In addition, the OPW has approved &euro;4.3m to date this year in funding to local authorities for over 80 local flood relief projects under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  I have written to local authorities to encourage them to use this scheme to address localised flooding issues.  It has proven an ideal vehicle to deliver localised flooding solutions in both towns and rural areas.  All of these works will help in a very real way to protect against flooding and alleviate worry and hardship for so many more people.</p><p>The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the lead Government Department for the response to severe weather and flooding.  That Department has published a Review Report on the response to the severe flooding that affected many parts of the country during winter 2015-2016.  The report examines the preparedness measures in place for such events and the coordination and effectiveness of those responses.  The report draws together the learning points from the response activities and sets out a series of recommendations to improve the preparedness and response to future emergencies.  Many of these recommendations have been implemented.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Drogheda District and the Dundalk District, on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 104 and 164 respectively.  There are also 18 Garda Reserves and 11 civilians attached to the Drogheda District and 9 Garda Reserves and 8 civilians attached to the Dundalk District.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-24a.97.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112400061#WRA09600"><p>The General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill was published in July 2013 following approval by the Government and is currently in drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation of gambling, including betting and gaming but excluding the National Lottery. It will provide for the licensing of all forms of on-line gambling.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme was referred to what was at the time the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration and observations.  The Joint Committee received 29 submissions and held public hearings following which it issued a report on 6 November 2013 which contained 8 conclusions and was laid before the Houses.</p>  <p>  The 2013 General Scheme provides for the conferring of responsibility for all regulatory matters in this area on the Minister for Justice and Equality, including licensing, inspections and prosecutions, and it envisages that these functions would be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality.  The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally.</p>  <p>  The Gambling Control Bill will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling.  The 2013 Scheme includes measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way.  These measures include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.</p>  <p>  It would remain the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest feasible opportunity.  In support of these efforts the Government has delegated powers of the Minister for Justice and Equality under the gaming and lotteries legislation to me as Minister of State.  Since my appointment I have requested my departmental officials to commission a review of the Scheme published in 2013 by way of taking account of intervening developments and technologies in the gaming sector.  This review will help to update policy in this area.  The review process is ongoing for completion by the end of this year</p>  <p>  At the same time, and pending the bringing forward of the main Bill, which is a major undertaking, I have also asked my Department to examine whether there are any individual pressing areas of concern, intended to be dealt with in the Bill, which could be dealt with sooner in the new year by separate legislative measures and this is being actively considered.  This will be augmented by the completion of the more complex work on the main Bill for Government approval and publication later during 2017.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware that there are a number of areas of immediate concern to members of the public and to the wider community.  It is my intention, therefore, that work on such early measures will continue in tandem with the wider review of the existing Scheme of a Bill to avoid any undue delay.</p>  <p>  I and officials of my Department are continuing to consult with relevant stake-holders, including those with experience in dealing with persons for whom gambling has become a problem and, as I have outlined, I intend to move forward as quickly as possible with the appropriate legislation.</p></reply>

There may be circumstances, such as in the case of a missing person, where a coroner has reason to believe that a death has occurred and that an inquest would be appropriate in the particular case, even though a body has not been recovered.  In this regard Section 23 of the Coroners Act states that - </p><p><i>&quot;Whenever a coroner has reason to believe that a death has occurred in or near his district in such circumstances that an inquest is appropriate and that, owing to the destruction of the body or its being irrecoverable, an inquest cannot be held except by virtue of this section, the Minister may, if he so thinks proper, direct an inquest in relation to the death to be held by that coroner or another coroner, and thereupon the coroner so directed shall hold an inquest in relation to the death in like manner as if the body were lying within his district and had been viewed by him.&quot;</i></p><p>The application of Section 23 in the case referred to by the Deputy has been raised in correspondence received in my Department and I can assure the Deputy that I have had the legal issues involved carefully examined.  The important point is that Section 23 does not empower me to issue a direction to hold an inquest where the coroner does not believe that such an inquest is appropriate.  In relation to the particular case in question I am advised that the Coroner is of the opinion that an inquest would not be appropriate at this time.  In such circumstances the question of me, as Minister, directing an inquest does not arise.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  It is expected that Community Policing and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p><p>The following table shows the number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to the  Lucan, Ronanstown and Clondalkin Districts for each of the years since 2014 to 30 September 2016.</p><p><b>Community  Garda&iacute;  Sept 2014- Sept 2016 </b><table><tr><th></th><th>SEPT 2014</th><th>SEPT 2015</th><th>SEPT 2016</th></tr><tr><td>LUCAN</td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>RONANSTOWN</td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>10</div></td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td>CLONDALKIN</td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Meath Division, on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 289.  There are also 22 Garda Reserves and 27 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 23 to the Meath Division. </p><p>The following table sets out the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the Meath Division on 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available.</p><p><b>MEATH DIVISION 31 OCTOBER 2016</b><table><tr><th>ASHBOURNE</th><th>ASHBOURNE</th><th><div>47</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>DULEEK</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNBOYNE</td><td><div>16</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNSHAUGHLIN</td><td><div>17</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LAYTOWN</td><td><div>20</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>105</div></td></tr><tr><td>KELLS</td><td>BAILE &Aacute;THA BU&Iacute;</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KELLS</td><td><div>37</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>OLDCASTLE</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>46</div></td></tr><tr><td>NAVAN</td><td>NAVAN</td><td><div>87</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NOBBER</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SLANE</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>94</div></td></tr><tr><td>TRIM</td><td>BALLIVOR</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNBOYNE</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ENFIELD</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LONGWOOD</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SUMMERHILL</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TRIM</td><td><div>34</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>44</div></td></tr><tr><td>MEATH TOTAL</td><td>17 STATIONS</td><td><div>289</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In line with developments at international level, this Directive represents a further strengthening of the risk based approach to countering these activities and, as such, an assessment of the risks in the gambling sector must necessarily be undertaken before any final determination is made in relation to what legislative or other measures will be required in regard to this sector.</p>  <p>  Ireland's first Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing National Risk Assessment (NRA) was published in October of this year on the website of the Department of Finance and the website of the Department of Justice and Equality.  In line with Ireland's obligations under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and the requirements of the 4th Directive the purpose of the NRA is to identify, understand and assess the money laundering and terrorist financing risks faced by Ireland.</p>  <p>  The NRA gave initial consideration to the gambling sector but determined that, due to its complexity, a separate in-depth risk assessment exercise would be required.  This assessment, which is on-going with the gambling sector, is being carried out by a sub-group of the Anti-Money Laundering Steering Committee (AMLSC) which is chaired by the Department of Finance.  The assessment, which will be completed in the coming months, will be considered by the AMLSC in terms of the transposition of the Directive.  The time frame for the transposition of this Directive is June 2017.</p></reply>

I am informed by INIS, that it is only in cases where the person's circumstances have changed since the grant of the visa or entry to the State that an application for an extension of visitor's permission would be considered.  An example of this would be an unexpected illness of either the visitor or the family member they are visiting. </p>  <p>  I am informed by INIS that there does not appear to be any change of circumstances in this case.  The person you refer to sought an extension of visitor permission to assist her daughter in caring for grandchildren and to receive treatment for a pre-existing medical condition.

I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the position remains unchanged.  The processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person concerned is under consideration and has not yet reached a conclusion but I understand however that the case is due to be submitted for decision in the near future.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While most cases are now generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.

The ECOFIN Council subsequently adopted decisions on 8th August giving notice of revised excessive deficit correction deadlines under Article 126(9) of the Treaty and to cancel fines for both countries. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Council decisions to cancel the fines for both Member States, the decisions under Article 126(8) were also to be followed by Commission proposals for the suspension of part of the commitments under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF).  It is important to note that to lift the suspension of ESIF, both member States were required to take effective action in response to the revised Council recommendations and report on it by mid-October of this year, at the same time as presenting their Draft Budgetary Plans. </p>  <p>  In line with this timeline, both Member States have now reported on action taken and in response, the Commission's careful analysis indicates that both Portugal and Spain have taken effective action to address their excessive deficits.  Accordingly, there will be no suspension of ESIF funds.  </p>  <p>  In view of the Commission's considered opinion that that both Member States have delivered on their policy commitments, and that effective action has been taken to address their excessive deficits, we can support lifting the suspension of funds at this stage. </p>  <p>  On the issue of flexibility more generally, it is clearly important that the rules are implemented in a fair and consistent manner and that all Member States are treated equally concerning the application of EU budget laws.  This is essential for continuing credibility.  However, some degree of flexibility should be allowed in certain circumstances, where this is appropriate and within the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>  <p>  For instance, the deadline for Ireland to correct its excessive deficit was extended on two occasions, in 2009 and in 2010, due to unexpected adverse economic events with major unfavourable consequences for government finances.  Ireland's excessive deficit has since been corrected in a durable manner and the country is now subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p></reply>

Many banks offer a number of ways to reduce transaction fees, in addition to offering ways to bank free of account maintenance and transaction fees.  Indeed the EU Payment Account Regulations will assist in this regard with the introduction of a basic bank account.  In addition to assist with product comparisons, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission  has a lo-call advice helpline (1890 432 432) and has helpful comparison tools available on its website ().</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, operational and strategic management issues in the Irish banks are solely a matter for the board and management of the relevant institution within the constraints imposed by their regulator, the SSM, and the law as it applies.  Notwithstanding the fact that the State has a significant shareholding in a number of institutions, I have no function in their day-to-day activities.  The Relationship Framework Agreements define the arm's length nature of the relationship between the State and the banks in which the State has an investment; the relationship framework agreement for each institution can be accessed below:</p><p>AIB: </p><p>Bank of Ireland: </p><p>Permanent  TSB: </p></reply>

HMRC have concluded, however, that it would not be appropriate to extend the benefit available under Article 14A to ARFs (other than those forming part of an insurance company's pension business).</p></reply>

Following this report, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) appointed Promontory Financial Group to further investigate these allegations.  Promontory's work, along with the involvement of the FCA, led RBS to recently announce redress for certain SME customers of RBS's Global Restructuring Group.  The final details of the redress scheme remain to be agreed with the FCA.</p>  <p>  As I have previously answered, Ulster Bank Ireland Limited undertook an independent review into the relevance of these allegations to its corresponding division, namely the Global Restructuring Group Ireland (GRGI).  On the 19th December 2014, Ulster Bank published the findings of the independent review by Mahon Hayes Curran into practices at GRGI.  The investigation found no evidence to support the allegations and suggested that GRGI's driving policy was to manage its customers through the cycle, supporting them where possible to return them to viability.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is the statutory body with responsibility for the investigation of any such allegations in an Irish context and I consider this as a matter properly for the Central Bank.  I am confident that legislative changes since the financial crisis have equipped the Central Bank with an array of investigative, regulatory and enforcement powers to ensure that regulated financial service providers adhere to the requirements of financial services legislation.</p>  <p>  These changes include significantly enhanced powers for the Central Bank to gather information under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 which broadened the Banks' information gathering and authorised officer powers.  It is evident that the Central Bank is properly undertaking its enforcement role by the recent sizeable settlements in enforcement cases.</p></reply>

The objective of the compliance program is to ensure that the purpose of any transfer of pension funds off-shore is for bona fide reasons and does not contravene tax legislation or undermine pension tax policy.  This compliance program is on-going.</p>  <p>  From 2012 to date a total of 565 notifications to transfer pension arrangements off-shore have been received by Revenue and the value of the funds transferred are in excess of &euro;73million.  It is important to bear in mind that transfers of pensions offshore are made for bona fide purposes and are fully compliant with tax legislation and pension tax policy.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by Revenue that moving pension funds off-shore in an effort to circumvent the requirements of Irish pension tax legislation may fall foul of the conditions under which a pension scheme was approved by Revenue as an exempt approved scheme or the conditions under which a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) product received Revenue approval.</p>  <p>  Pension tax legislation does not provide for any penalties for non-compliance in this area.  The sanction available is the withdrawal of the approval of the pension scheme as an exempt approved scheme or the withdrawal of the approval of the PRSA product.  The effect of such sanctions is the claw back of the tax relief previously given.  As of this point in time no such withdrawal of approval has taken place.</p>  <p>  As is established practice, my Department will liaise as appropriate with Revenue and other relevant Departments in relation to this issue.</p></reply>

An expansion of up to 0.5 per cent of GDP is recommended by the Commission.  It is crucial to stress that the Commission recommends that this expansion be differentiated by country and, in particular, with reference to Member States' positions with respect to the fiscal rules.</p>  <p>  Specifically, the Commission is recommending that Member States that are over-achieving their budgetary targets should use this excess fiscal space.  The rationale is that this spending in some Member States would support the recovery in the euro area as a whole as other Member States would be able to ramp up exports to those Member States implementing an expansionary policy.</p>  <p>  What this means for Ireland in particular is that the Commission is recommending that Member States that have not yet achieved their targets, i.e. a balanced budget, should continue on the adjustment path.  In other words, Ireland should continue to implement the fiscal policy as laid out in the Budget.</p>  <p>  My Department broadly agrees with the Commission recommendation to the euro area as a whole.  Monetary policy is now considered to be 'over-burdened' and it is time for fiscal policy to support the recovery also but this should of course be on a case-by-case basis.  Those Member States with fiscal space should use it.  This would improve the recovery in the euro area as a whole.  Those Member States which have not yet achieved a balanced budget should continue to implement 'tight' policies so that their public finances remain on a sustainable path.  This is what we are doing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I should add that this approach would have the added benefit of improving demand in our external trading partners which of course is good for Ireland.</p></reply>

The Tracker Mortgage Examination remains a key priority for the Central Bank as it continues to challenge lenders to ensure that progress is being made and fair outcomes are being achieved for customers.</p>  <p>  All lenders have developed a detailed plan and framework, including establishing appropriate governance and reporting structures, for conducting the Examination and are carrying out internal reviews of their mortgage books, to identify any customers who may have been impacted by a failure to honour a customer's contractual entitlements, or comply with the regulatory requirements regarding disclosure and transparency of information.</p>  <p>  While all lenders are currently in the process of carrying out their internal reviews it is important to note that some lenders may have their internal reviews completed sooner than others depending on the size of their mortgage books and the complexities associated with them completing the Examination.</p>  <p>  As groups of impacted customers are identified, in the first instance, the lender must stop charging the incorrect rate of interest on the customer's account, and then communicate this to the customer, to ensure that any further customer detriment is stopped as early as possible.</p>  <p>  Once a full review of the customer's account is complete, following external independent third party assurance, the lender will then issue a letter to the customer explaining the nature of the error, the correct rate to apply to the customer's account and information on the next steps in the Examination, including the redress and compensation process.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it will provide an update on progress on the Examination before the year end and that it can provide a copy of this update to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p><p>This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p><p>I would advise that if there are children in the school for whom there are particular concerns the Principal should raise these concerns with the assigned NEPS Psychologist with a view to determining what course of action is appropriate to alleviate these concerns</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, a review of the DEIS Programme which commenced last year is currently nearing completion and a new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion will be published before the end of this year.  The Review process includes the development of a new identification framework to assess the level of educational disadvantage in schools.  This new framework will assess all schools in the country, including the school to which the Deputy refers in his question,  and it will not be necessary for school to make an application for assessment.  Pending the completion of the Review, it is not my intention to make any changes to the current programme, including the inclusion of additional schools. </p><p>In relation to the new SEN model I might explain that the NCSE identified that the current model for allocating resource teachers to schools is potentially inequitable, because access to the range of professional assessments required for the diagnosis of low incident disabilities is not always readily available to those who cannot afford to access them privately.  The NCSE has also advised that the current model can lead to unnecessary labelling of children from a young age.</p><p>The NCSE has proposed a new resource teaching allocation model which will, when introduced, remove the formal requirement for diagnostic assessment to access additional support and which will provide resources to schools based on school profiles.</p><p>A pilot of this new model was conducted in 47 primary and post primary schools over the course of the 2015/16 school year. A review of this pilot has been completed and a report of the review is currently being finalised. It is understood that the review will indicate that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents.</p><p>Schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need.  Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching.  Schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources. Schools also welcomed that they no longer need to wait for diagnosis and that this facilitates intervention at an earlier stage based on the schools identification of need. In addition schools indicated a belief that they were broadly well supported in meeting the needs of children with Special Educational Needs.</p><p>As part the recent Budget announcements, it was therefore announced that following development and piloting over the past number of years, a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017.  </p><p>An additional &euro;18 million will be provided in 2017 to provide for around 900 resource teacher posts.  </p><p>Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months</p></reply>

The work of the Teaching Council is grounded in the values of professionally-led regulation, shared professional responsibility and collective professional confidence.</p>  <p>  The period between qualification and fully independent practice as a teacher is a vital stage of the newly qualified teacher's career.  During this phase the newly qualified teacher's development as a practising professional is facilitated by coherent and supportive induction and probation processes specified by the Teaching Council, which all teachers must successfully complete to achieve full registration.  The Teaching Council works closely with the Department to ensure appropriate supports for newly qualified teachers are in place and the Department funds the national induction programme for teachers, NIPT.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken in recent years to facilitate newly qualified teachers in achieving full registration with the Teaching Council.  The minimum service requirement for probation for primary teachers has been reduced from 170 days to 100 days. </p>  <p>  Under Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act applicants for teaching posts in recognised schools are required to be registered with the Teaching Council. </p>  <p>  While the recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school or Education and Training Board, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012), Circular 31/2011 details a number of measures for recruitment of teachers. </p>  <p>  My Department has directed managerial authorities of schools to recruit unemployed teachers ahead of retired ones.  Each principal must report to his or her board of management on a regular basis that a list of unemployed registered teachers is being maintained, and the circumstances, where relevant, that a registered teacher in receipt of a public service pension or an unregistered person has been engaged.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that, this September, 2,260 additional teaching posts were available in our primary and post primary schools due to additional funding secured in Budget 2016.  In addition, further provision has been made in Budget 2017 for 2,400 additional posts.  These posts, together with the measures outlined above, will enhance the opportunities for newly qualified teachers to obtain post qualification teaching experience to achieve full registration with the Teaching Council.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that a newly qualified teacher who is unable to complete a condition for registration within the specified period may apply to the Teaching Council for an extension to that period.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates the funding (block grant funding) to institutions and it is then a matter for the individual institution as to how that funding is allocated internally.  The HEA allocates the available funding based on a Recurrent Grant Allocation Model which is driven primarily by student numbers weighted by the relative costs of providing education in different disciplines with additional performance mechanisms built in to reflect outcomes such as those relating to access, skills-based provision and research. </p>  <p>  Total core funding available to HEIs includes the block grant funding, student contributions, tuition fees and other income sources e.g. private funding. In 2015 funding per student amounted to an estimated &euro;9,500 per full-time student.</p></reply>

Special classes are part of a continuum of educational provision that enables students with more complex special educational needs to be educated, in smaller class groups, within their local mainstream schools. </p><p>They offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day. Special class for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil - teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 Ss for a class of 6 children.</p><p>Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.</p><p>Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are 1,153 special classes available, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548.</p><p>This includes a total of 889 classes for children with autism; 127 are ASD early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approx. 16% on 2015/16 classes for children with autism.</p><p>The NCSE have observed a growth in the numbers of children with autism in schools over the past two years, however the specific details on these numbers are not yet available from the NCSE.  The NCSE's Autism Policy Advice report noted that there were almost 14,000 students diagnosed with autism in schools in 2014.The Advice further stated that there were 1,974 students attending autism classes in primary schools, 699 attending Early Intervention classes in special and primary schools, and 733 students attending autism classes at post primary level.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, are available on www.ncse.ie in county order, and with new classes identified.</p><p>The NCSE continues to review the special class placement requirements and is currently engaging with schools with regard to opening new special classes in areas where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 6<sup>th</sup>July 2016.  The Admissions Bill provides that where a school has places available it must admit all applicants. The Bill contains a provision for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs and for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school for a child who has no school place (other than a child with special educational needs). </p><p>Furthermore, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, the Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. re-configure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved by the National Council for Special Education through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers.</p><p>The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes.  These guidelines are available to download from www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school.  </p>  <p>  Children with disabilities have access to pre-school services under a new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) programme of supports, which was announced in June 2016, by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. </p>  <p>  AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school. </p>  <p>  The supports include: </p>  <p>  - A new Inclusion Charter for the Early Years sector, alongside updated and strengthened Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines for Early Childhood Care and Education. </p>  <p>  - In relation to the qualifications of early years practitioners, a new higher education programme for early years  practitioners (LINC) which will commence from September 2016.</p>  <p>  - A new national specialist service which is based in the Better Start National Early Years Quality Development Service will provide expert advice, mentoring and support to pre-school providers from a team of 50 specialists in early years care and education for children with disabilities. </p>  <p>  - A new national scheme will provide specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations which are necessary to support a child's participation in the ECCE programme. </p>  <p>  - A new national scheme will also provide additional capitation to pre-school providers where this is critical to fund extra support in the classroom and enable a child's participation in pre-school. It is estimated that only 1 to 1.5% of children in pre-school will require, and therefore be eligible for, this scheme of additional  capitation. </p>  <p>  Details of the supports which are available under AIM can be found at www.preschoolaccess.ie which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports.  As the child in question is attending a private pre-school through the ECCE programme, questions relating to the AIM supports should be addressed to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that when the child in question is due to commence school, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is an independent statutory agency, is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including SNA support.  The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO.  Contact details are also available on the NCSE website.  The local SENO is also available to discuss any concerns that parents have about the present or future educational needs of their child.</p></reply>

At an overall level, while 25,000 new homes a year are needed to meet demand, annual output fell to as low as 8,300 in recent years. </p><p>The key objective of the Government's <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness,</i>published on 19 July 2016 is to increase and accelerate housing delivery, across all tenures, to help individuals and families find homes.  In relation to social housing provision, the <i>Action Plan</i>aims to deliver 47,000 units of social housing over the period to 2021 through construction, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, supported by Exchequer investment of some &euro;5.35 billion.</p><p>The Plan also provides for early solutions to address homelessness and the unacceptable level of families in emergency accommodation, including the objective that by mid-2017, hotels will only be used for emergency accommodation in very limited circumstances. </p><p>Implementation of the <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness</i>is being advanced across a number of Departments, under the oversight of the Cabinet Committee on Housing, chaired by An Taoiseach.  Within my own Department, an Implementation Board of senior officials, chaired by the Secretary General, monitors progress on a fortnightly basis.  In addition, project working group structures for each of the Action Plan&rsquo;s five Pillars are being put in place to ensure that any operational considerations relating to the delivery of actions are identified early and resolved quickly and effectively. </p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>contains a clear commitment to reporting regular progress, particularly through quarterly progress reports.  The <i>First Quarterly Progress Report on the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness - Rebuilding Ireland</i>(in respect of Quarter 3 commitments and actions), which was published on 1 November and can be accessed at , sets out the progress on the implementation of the relevant actions. </p><p>Further progress reports will follow on a quarterly basis, with the next due to be published in January 2017.  Each Quarterly Report will focus on the actions due to be progressed or completed in the preceding quarter.</p></reply>

The pilot libraries are fully accessible in compliance with statutory accessibility requirements for public buildings.

In the case of certain appointments to State Boards, statutory selection procedures must be followed or nominations must be sought from independent nominating panels before appointments are made by the Minister or the Government, as appropriate.  In addition, in the case of a number of Boards, not all of the appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister, and in some situations appointments are made by the Minister with the consent of another Minister.  Appointments to An Bord Plean&aacute;la are of a full-time executive nature and are governed by statutory processes.

This service provides a mechanism for Departments to advertise board vacancies and it gives prospective candidates an opportunity to register their general interest in a position on a state Board and to be alerted to upcoming vacancies. </p><p>In general, PAS is notified six months in advance for anticipated vacancies.  This allows sufficient time to publicise vacancies, arrange interviews and submit a short list of nominees. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-24a.306.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112400066#WRF00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 to 119, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established in September 2004 under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which regulates the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented residential sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.  The RTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p><p>The RTB has 40 staff in place at present with sanction for an additional 11 posts.  The RTB is currently working to fill these posts.  In 2012, the RTB awarded a contract outsourcing its call-centre activities and the processing of paper registrations, allowing the Board to focus on its dispute resolution functions.  There are currently 34 people employed on the RTB account by t he outsourced service provider.</p><p>As the RTB replaces the Courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes, there are statutory time periods laid down in the Residential Tenancies Act to provide for due process.  There are a number of factors that may delay the processing of a case including where adjournment requests are made or where there are difficulties locating a party to the dispute.</p><p>The RTB received 4,023 applications for dispute resolution in 2015, a 19% increase on 2014, when 3,374 cases were received.  In 2015, some 84% of cases were processed or closed within 3 to 4 months.  The RTB is continuously reviewing operations to increase efficiency and processing times continue to improve.  The RTB reports that currently 96% of cases are completed in 4 months or less &ndash; a considerable improvement when compared to the 84% achieved in 2015.</p><p>A telephone mediation service was introduced by the RTB in late 2013 as an alternative means to address disputes.  Processing times for telephone mediation cases in 2015 were typically 6 to 9 weeks.  Processing times for telephone mediation have improved further in the course of 2016 to an average of 6 weeks.  The average processing time for disputes referred to an Adjudicator was 14 weeks in 2015 and has improved to an average of 10 weeks in 2016.</p><p>Parties to a dispute can appeal the decision of an Adjudicator to a Tenancy Tribunal within 21 days of the date of receiving the adjudicators report.  Parties to the mediation process who did not reach an agreement or where the agreement has broken down may refer the dispute to the Tenancy Tribunal within 10 days.  The average processing times for Tribunal cases is 8 to 12 weeks from appeal to the issuing of the Determination Order.</p><p>The RTB&rsquo;s funding is derived primarily from a proportion of the fee income accruing from tenancy registrations, as set down by Ministerial Order.  Since 1 July 2016, the RTB is entitled to retain 100% of the registration fee income to fund its activities.  The RTB also retains the fees it charges for its dispute resolution services.  In 2016, the RTB also received &euro;1.5m in funding from the Exchequer in relation to the planning and procurement of the new tenancy deposit protection scheme and &euro;0.35m to fund operational costs.</p><p>The deposit protection scheme will be commenced as soon as the necessary conditions are in place to support roll-out.  These are likely to include changes to the supporting information technology and contracts with outsourced project partners where appropriate.  Work in this regard is already underway.  Until the scheme is operational and ready to go live, there will be no change in the administration of tenancy deposits under the Act.</p><p>Details of the Board&rsquo;s income and expenditure are set out in its Annual Reports and Accounts, which are available on its website at .</p><p>My Department continues to keep the resources available to the RTB under close review and engages regularly with the Board on this matter.  It is of course important that the RTB is adequately funded into the future and this matter is among the issues currently under consideration in the context of the development of the forthcoming Strategy for the Rental Sector.</p></reply>

These are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .  Together, these two local authorities have a target to deliver 445 social housing units for the period out to 2017, supported by an allocation of &euro;24 million, to be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes.</p><p>Both local authorities have made proposals in respect of new social housing delivery via capital-funded programmes, which have been approved by my Department; these are set out in announcements made in May 2015, July 2015 and January 2016 and included 56 new units of accommodation in respect of Cavan and Monaghan, supported by investment of some &euro;6.3 million, details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:  <i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i></p><p> </p><p>.</p><p>Since then, 79 additional social housing units have been approved for Cavan and Monaghan and added to their pipeline, as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>Location </th><th>Delivery Method </th><th>No. of Units </th></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>Rosehill, Mullagh (Phase 6) </td><td>LA Construction </td><td>8 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>Liseggerton, Clones by Oaklee Housing Trust </td><td>AHB Construction </td><td>16 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>Monaghan Town </td><td>3 Turnkey developments </td><td>50 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>Smithborough </td><td>Turnkey   development   <br /><br /></td><td>5 </td></tr></table></p><p>The level of funding that will be provided to the Cavan and Monaghan local authorities for housing related activity in 2017 will be directly linked to the scale of delivery achieved by the local authorities on these schemes and any other schemes currently being progressed which were approved prior to May 2015, such as the delivery by Respond! of 7 units of accommodation at Convent Lands, Carrickmacross, which is currently under construction and due for completion in Q1 2017.  I am keen that these are advanced as soon as possible and funding will be allocated to these in line with their delivery.</p><p>There is also a range of housing stock improvement initiatives funded through my Department, such as the energy efficiency retrofitting programme, adaptations to houses for people with a disability and the elderly, and returning vacant properties to productive use; 2017 allocations for these schemes will issue to all local authorities, including Cavan and Monaghan, early in the New Year.</p><p>Local authorities also use a variety of current funded mechanisms to secure social housing including the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) programmes which my Department will continue to support in 2017 and beyond.</p><p>The SHCEP is currently funding 36 operational units in Cavan and Monaghan.  An additional 51 units have been approved for leasing by two Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and are anticipated to become operational by the end of 2016, bringing the total number of operational units to 87.  These 87 units will continue to be funded by SHCEP in 2017 in addition to any additional new units sourced by the LAs or AHBs.</p><p>Support is also provided by my Department to AHBs under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility for the delivery of new social housing.  This funding approach is being used to support the acquisition and construction of 55 additional units by three AHBs in Cavan and Monaghan. Delivery is contingent on AHBs securing the balance of funding required from either private finance or other borrowings.  If successful, it is anticipated that these 55 units will be delivered by the end of 2017.  Locations include Kingscourt, Clones and Carrickmacross.</p><p>The HAP is currently available in 19 local authority areas, including Monaghan County Council, and to eligible homeless households in the Dublin local authorities under the Homeless HAP pilot scheme.  Since Monaghan&rsquo;s commencement of the HAP statutory pilot scheme on 1 October 2014, almost 350 households have been supported to date and HAP support will continue into 2017 and beyond.  There are currently more than 15,000 households nationally being supported by the scheme and 10,690 of these tenancies have been set-up in 2016 to date. The scheme is being extended on a statutory basis to a further nine local authorities, including Cavan County Council, on 1 December 2016, subject to the necessary Regulations being in place.</p><p>In relation to RAS, Cavan County Council&rsquo;s end of year 2015 activity report indicated that there were 562 tenancies supported by the scheme.  At the end of 2015, Monaghan County Council reported that there were 256 tenancies supported by RAS.  These tenancies will continue to be supported into 2017 and beyond in addition to new tenancies which are added in 2016 and 2017.</p></reply>

The strategy will be structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  In terms of supply, the strategy will focus on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply.  All the main issues that affect the availability of dwellings in the rental market, including the issue of short-term lettings, will be considered during the development of the strategy, which will be informed by submissions received from the recent public consultation process that concluded on 7 November.  The overarching objective of the strategy will be to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering true choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.</p><p>In the context of the recent determination by An Bord Pleanala in relation to the exclusive use of an apartment as a commercial letting through Air BnB, I have asked my Department to examine the decision, which is of course primarily a matter for planning authorities to determine, and consider the appropriate steps, including the provision of statutory planning guidelines, to provide clarity and consistency of approach by all planning authorities in terms of planning requirements for such commercial lettings.  In this regard, I will provide guidance to Local Authorities by way of circular letter before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property, including capital, owned but not personally used or enjoyed is assessable for means-testing purposes. Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use.  However, it does not include property such as the family home a person is personally using or enjoying i.e. residing in or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>The current market value of the relevant property is established (having regard to local property prices) as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property.  The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a notional formula. </p><p>The current assessment method, involving a disregard of an initial amount of capital and an increasing notional weekly value for amounts in excess of the disregarded amount, applies for most welfare schemes. </p><p>The assessment formula is not designed to mirror or impute potential interest or annuity rates available to investors or potential rental income from a property and no account is taken of any such income in the overall means assessment.  The formula reflects the policy of ensuring that those with property and capital of modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support while those with larger amounts avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.  This approach is one of the key elements of a means-tested income support system. </p><p>This property/capital formula also applies where a person has other types of property (including capital such as monies held in financial institutions or otherwise or the market value of shares). </p><p>The assessment formula for most schemes, including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, farm assist and one-parent family payment, provides for &euro;20,000 of capital to be disregarded.<table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>For the purposes of the State pension non-contributory and carer&rsquo;s allowance the amounts above are doubled in the case of a couple.  Social welfare legislation provides that &euro;50,000 can be disregarded for disability allowance claimants, and &euro;5,000 in the case of supplementary welfare allowance claimants. </p><p>Any changes to the current assessment arrangements would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

BSCFA is a non-statutory scheme which provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs of clothing and footwear when children start school each autumn.  BSCFA payments have issued to over 150,000 families in 2016 at a cost of over &euro;39 million. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to reintroduce the specialised footwear grant.

Clearly, a substantial portion of the population may suffer significant unwanted reductions in living standards in their retirement years unless they begin to save for that retirement. </p>  <p>  Work is already underway on this reform.  Last year, a group was established, chaired by the Department of Social Protection and made up of senior officials from a range of public bodies and international pension reform experts, to look at the elements of a Universal Retirement Savings System and to produce a roadmap for the Government to consider.  The primary aim is to develop a system that provides for universal coverage and that also significantly improves adequacy of provision over time.  Initial work has concentrated on whether the best model would be one which is mandatory for all workers without supplementary retirement savings coverage or one which would automatically enrol those without supplementary retirement savings coverage while allowing an opt-out. </p>  <p>  Analysis of international systems has been undertaken which clearly demonstrates the importance of establishing consensus across political, business and civil society lines in delivering such a system.  Whilst there is much to learn by looking at the strengths and weaknesses apparent in aspects of other countries&rsquo; pension systems, there is no blueprint for reform that Ireland can implement directly and any solution must be tailored to fit the Irish situation.  To this end, consultations have been conducted and more are planned with consumers, representatives of employers, trade unions, the pensions industry and advocate/interest groups as well as a range of Irish and international experts in this field.  Any decisions by Government will also be informed by the conclusions of the recent consultation process undertaken by the Pensions Authority aimed at developing measures to reform and simplify the wider pensions system. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Within the British government, primary responsibility for this issue lies with the Foreign Secretary.  Since 2011, there have been ongoing discussions on the matter between officials of my Department and the FCO.  While I have not to date discussed the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my officials have raised it with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office.  </p>  <p>  Uncertainty concerning the extent to which each Government exercises jurisdiction within Lough Foyle has created practical difficulties for the conduct of a number of activities there.  This has included difficulty in creating a system for licencing of aquaculture by the Loughs Agency in accordance with the intentions of the two Governments under the 1999 agreement establishing the North/South implementation bodies.  I want to see the Loughs Agency working to its full potential which is in the interests of everyone on this island.</p>  <p>  Following discussions in 2011 between the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the British Foreign Secretary, both Governments agreed to seek to address and resolve jurisdictional issues relating to both Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.    </p>  <p>  Since that time a series of meetings have taken place at official level between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The issues involved are complex and involve a range of different actors, including the Crown Estates.  These discussions are continuing and the next meeting is scheduled for early next month.  The Irish Government remains committed to reaching a successful conclusion to these talks.</p></reply>

That scheme was constructed in the 1950s under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  It was designed to provide outfall to agricultural land and not designed to provide protection to properties from extreme flooding events such as have been seen in recent years.  OPW carried out some emergency repair works to the embankments this year and intend to carry out further defence works in 2017.  It must be highlighted that the Cashen Estuary is a Special Area of Conservation and as such has protected status.  Consultants for the Cashen Estuary Drainage Project have recently been appointed by this Office to bring a viable scheme forward through environmental assessment, detailed design, tender and construction, subject to available funding.</p></reply>

To ensure that these targets are met, managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.  In this regard, the voted expenditure report published with the end-October Exchequer statement outlines that gross voted expenditure of &euro;44,219 million to end-October was &euro;795 million (1.8%) below profile.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Expenditure Report 2017, total gross voted expenditure for 2016 is now estimated at &euro;56.1 billion.  This is 0.6 per cent higher than the level set out in the Estimates for 2016.  This increase in expenditure reflects an additional &euro;200 million of capital funding for necessary repair work to transport infrastructure arising from flood damage at the start of the year and expenditure arising on school building works.  In addition, an amount of &euro;220 million is included to fund a Christmas Bonus to long-term Social Welfare recipients.  In line with previous years, it is anticipated that the additional cost of providing this bonus will be offset by year-end savings across a number of Departments.  The Christmas Bonus will be funded through both voted expenditure and the Social Insurance Fund.  In addition, since publication of the Expenditure Report 2017, given the need to respond proactively to growing uncertainties for Irish based enterprise, additional funding is to be allocated to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in 2016.  This additional funding, which by fast-tracking the delivery of certain spending programmes in 2016 through an increased 2016 allocation, should provide the space for increased spending on Brexit initiatives in 2017 within the allocation for 2017 agreed at Budget time.  All of these additional amounts will be reflected in the Supplementary Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Given the scale of the under-spend versus profile at the end of October and the level of savings surrendered to the Exchequer at the end of 2015, it is expected that all Supplementary Estimates can be accommodated within the overall gross voted expenditure amount of &euro;56.1 billion set out in the Expenditure Report 2017.</p>  <p>  Expenditure Report 2017 sets out total gross voted expenditure of &euro;58 billion in 2017.  This represents a year on year increase of under 3&frac12;%.  This represents a prudent level of increase as we continue to repair the public finances.  However, we have to be mindful of the considerable expenditure pressures facing the public finances and it is important that we continue to evaluate how we spend our money to ensure that limited resources provide much needed public services and social infrastructure.  Given this context, I announced on Budget day that a spending review will be carried out in advance of Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  Given the many competing priorities and demands for resources, there is an ongoing requirement to implement reforms that improve how public services are delivered, and that achieve savings which can be reinvested in frontline services.  The Public Service has delivered significant productivity gains and service improvements over the last number of years, as set out in the Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan (published April 2016).  We must build on this progress, and it is essential that targeted recruitment and investment in public services is done in tandem with further public service reform measures.  This includes, for example, more digital delivery of services, improved customer service and business processes, and greater use of shared services.  When Departments identify savings arising from such reform measures, such savings are in general made available to Departments to reinvest in the delivery of services.  It is also very important to ensure that the public service workforce operates in a manner which maximises the positive impact on public service provision of the increased staff numbers reflected in the budgetary allocations for 2017.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a strategic review of infrastructural requirements was undertaken by my Department as part of last year's capital review.  This resulted in the publication in September 2015 of 'Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021', which outlined a &euro;42bn framework for infrastructural investment across Ireland.  The Plan prioritises spending on what were considered to be the areas of greatest need as the economy continues its strong recovery.  There will be a review of Government priorities within the Capital Plan in the context of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan which I announced at Budget-time last month. </p></reply>

However, this payment has now been rescheduled for receipt in December and will now be in the amount of &euro;100 million rather than the &euro;370 million originally profiled.  The reason for this change in the timeframe for payment to the Exchequer of the remainder of the Bord Gais Energy sale proceeds, by way of special dividend, is in order to maximise the positive GGB impact of the transaction proceeds and thereby also maximise the potential use to which these funds can be put by Government, within the restrictions imposed by Eurostat accounting rules.</p>  <p>  Stripping out the effect of the Ervia dividend, the position in relation to the dividends received from the other commercial semi-State companies would show that these are at 106% or &euro;66 million ahead of profile.</p></reply>

For the public service as a whole, individual level data - such as relating to location - is not held centrally by Department rather it resides as part of the individual employee data record held and maintained in different sectors of the public service.  The Deputy may wish to follow-up with the main sectoral Departments, such as Health, Education, Defence and Justice to ascertain the availability of this information in each case.</p>  <p>  In terms of that element of the Deputy's question relating to private sector employment, The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of employment estimates in the State and is conducted in line with relevant European regulations for the conduct of labour force surveys.</p>  <p>  The labour market estimates produced by the QNHS are designed to meet strict quality criteria set down by EUROSTAT, which specify the level of statistical accuracy that these estimates must achieve at national level.  The CSO also produces regional labour market estimates from the QNHS (NUTS 3 regions) which is beyond the level of regional detail (NUTS 2 regions) required by EUROSTAT.  It is not possible to produce robust county level estimates from the current QNHS data.  Achieving representative samples at county level on which to base labour market estimates would require a substantial increase in the number of households interviewed and the number of field interviewers required to interview them.  The main source of detailed county and small area level information is the Census of Population.  The Census asks respondents to declare their Principal Economic Status (PES), which classifies their usual situation with regard to employment, and includes the categories of employed and unemployed, amongst others. A detailed analysis of the change in 'PES' between 2011 and 2016 will be available at county level and below when the 2016 Census results are published in 2017.</p></reply>

While the hospital continues to recruit nursing staff successfully, balancing this with attrition rates, maternity leave and sick leave continues to present a challenge.  However, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group is exhausting every recruitment and retention avenue available to it, including international recruitment, and is proactively working on nurse recruitment to support the opening of the new theatre. </p>  <p>  Long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are not acceptable and my Department has been working closely with the HSE to address service pressures, with most recently additional funding of &euro;2 million provided under the HSE winter initiative specifically for scoliosis patients.  The Department will continue to work with the HSE and the relevant hospitals to ensure improvements in access to spinal surgery are achieved.  I recently met with a number of scoliosis advocacy groups to discuss their concerns, following which the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has begun a process of engagement with the advocacy groups on developing a partnership approach with the hospitals and consultants to the design and planning of services for children with scoliosis.</p></reply>

The Government is aware of the continuing needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments which support choice and independence.  In that regard, monthly payments of &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time the scheme closed.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Programme for Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals in this regard is at an advanced stage and I anticipate that this will be brought to Government shortly.</p><p>The proposals seek to ensure that there is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; there is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and the Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>As for other supports provided for transport for people with disabilities, the Revenue Commissioners operate a tax relief scheme for the purchase of adapted vehicles for drivers and passengers with disabilities.  This scheme, which falls under the remit of the Minister for Finance, provides relief from Value Added Tax and Vehicle Registration Tax up to a certain limit, on the purchase of an adapted care for the transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities.  It provides for payment of a fuel grant, an exemption from motor tax and an exemption from toll bridge charges.

It is proposed that there will be a mid-term review of the State&rsquo;s capital envelope, which will assess progress, review emerging pressures and demands.  It is expected that this mid-term review will be completed in 2017.  My Department published an eHealth strategy in 2013 which highlighted the opportunity for providing for a digital infrastructure to support health and social care to improve health delivery efficiency and underpin patient safety.  The strategy also recognised the need for further investment in healthcare Information and Communications Technology and while significant improvement in the capital spending for ICT in health since 2012 has taken place, further investment will be required into the future and this is recognised in the Programme for Government.  In recent months the HSE has submitted a business case for a national electronic health care record for Ireland which will provide for a digital platform across the acute, community and primary care areas allowing the connectivity necessary to support models of integrated care.  It is envisaged that the first acute hospital setting for an electronic health record will be the New Children's Hospital.  In the coming months I hope to being proposals to Government on how to move this agenda forward.<table><tr><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>55</td><td>60</td><td>70</td><td>85</td><td>87</td><td>412</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.   </p>  <p>  At that meeting, I outlined that one of my priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Support Loan Scheme.  Developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150m, it will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements.  This is a cash flow support facility to improve the working capital position of viable primary agriculture SMEs, including farmers.  The loans are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts.  Last week I welcomed the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme, which will be operational as early as possible in 2017.</p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year.  This will be available immediately, for this year&rsquo;s tax liability, and this will go some way towards addressing current cash flow concerns. </p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payment would be made this year in respect of Basic Payment and Greening Payment scheme. </p>  <p>  Advance payment commenced on the 17th October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations.  Up to last week &euro;786 million has been paid out to 119,904 farmers. </p>  <p>  I was also pleased to note that the processing of the Areas of Natural Constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected that approx 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.  </p>  <p>  I stressed at the meeting also and want to re-state my view that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry, to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-24a.650.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112400074#WRO01100"><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.broadband.gov.ie</font></i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>As you will see from the Map Belcarra, County Mayo largely falls within a BLUE area and will be covered by commercial operators.  Individuals can check whether their premise is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and  entering their Eircode.  Based on information provided by one commercial operator I understand that high speed broadband services is available to some 310 premises from the Belcarra exchange and that work on a further 185 premises has been completed and rollout is planned for these premises in early 2017.  This is however a matter for the company in question. </p><p>While I cannot compel any operator to provide services to a particular premises, the NBP aims to ensure that all premises can access high speed broadband.  My Department is therefore closely monitoring the rollout of services in the BLUE area, including Belcarra.  I would encourage<font color="#1F497D"> </font>consumers in Belcarra who cannot access high speed broadband services to contact my Department directly at <i><font color="#0000FF">broadband@dccae.gov.ie</font></i>, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services<font color="#1F497D">.  T</font>his information will assist the Department in keeping track of progress in those areas.  If it transpires that some premises will not be connected by the commercial telecoms sector, I will consider including them in the procurement process, as part of the State intervention. </p><p>My Department is now in the formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. </p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  I expect the Taskforce to report by end 2016. </p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total  spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. </p><p>These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country, including County Mayo.</p></reply>

The importance of Shannon Airport is also recognised in the NAP.  In particular the Policy confirms that Shannon Airport is of strategic importance for connectivity of the mid-West region and also serves as a "gateway" to the Wild Atlantic Way.</p>  <p>  I have previously outlined that my Department's first priority, under the Capital Plan, is to ensure the maintenance of our existing transport infrastructure, including our rail network, at steady state levels so that it remains safe and fit for purpose.  In view of the current constraints on availability of funding, the priority for the heavy rail network under the Plan is to improve efficiency and maintain safety standards, rather than expanding the network, or providing a super train from Dublin to Shannon.</p>  <p>  We must ensure through our national aviation policy framework that adequate facilities are provided in the locations that airlines and people, including tourists and those in other business sectors, wish to travel to.  A strong, competitive and efficient network of airports and international air links are vitally important for developing our trade and tourism sectors, particularly having regard to our island status and peripheral location.  </p>  <p>  The capacity enhancements planned at Dublin airport were foreseen by astute planners fifty years ago when, for example, they ensured that the approaches for the second parallel runway were kept clear of any substantial development.  In terms of access, inward investment, economic development and tourism generally, Dublin Airport is, and is expected to remain, the primary gateway to the State.</p></reply>

Since the introduction of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986, small companies have been obliged to publically disclose directors&rsquo; remuneration.  This requirement is now provided for at Chapter 6 of Part 6 of the Companies Act 2014, which largely re-enacts the existing provisions in earlier Companies Acts.</p>  <p>  Section 26 of the Companies (Accounting) Bill 2016 exempts micro companies from the requirement to disclose directors&rsquo; remuneration.  Micro companies are a new category of company which will encompass only the very smallest of undertakings.  To qualify as &ldquo;micro&rdquo;, a company must not exceed more than one of the following three thresholds: a turnover of &euro;700,000, a balance sheet of &euro;350,000 and an average number of employees of 10.  Because of their very small size, micro companies will be exempt from disclosing a range of notes to the financial statements, one of which is directors&rsquo; remuneration.  This is considered appropriate and proportionate given their very small size.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the micro entity regime was part of a public consultation run by the Department in late 2013.  As the relevant provisions for small companies had been in law for some time, and the Government was not considering any changes to them, those provisions were not referred to in the consultation.  For similar reasons, it was not considered necessary to consult the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>  <p>  I understand that concerns were raised previously on this issue.  However, directors&rsquo; remuneration is an important piece of information for the understanding of the financial performance of a company.  Its disclosure is an appropriate measure in light of the fiduciary duties owed by directors to companies.</p></reply>

There are many external factors over which Ireland has no control.  Nevertheless, we have put in place policies that ensure we are anticipatory and responsive and build resilience in our enterprise base.  These policies are working.  Based on the latest CSO data released earlier this week, 189,500 additional people are at work since the start of the Action Plan for Jobs Process in 2012.  Over the last twelve months, an additional 56,500 are at work.  The unemployment rate is now down to 7.9%, from over 15.1% in 2012.  Over 72% of the additional jobs created were outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  To sustain the progress being made on job creation in the context of the UK decision to leave the EU, we have taken a number of policy and expenditure decisions, including those outlined in Budget 2017, to ameliorate the impact on Irish based enterprises and to ensure we remain on track to achieve the ambitions set out in the Programme for Government and in Enterprise 2025.  The Government will outline a full suite of measures in the forthcoming Action Plan for Jobs 2017. </p>  <p>  As a policy framework, Enterprise 2025 does indeed remain relevant, in particular in the context of the events unfolding over recent months.  Enterprise 2025 sets out a framework to ensure that we have coherence across relevant government departments and complementary policies &ndash; this coherence and cross government commitment to job creation and sustainable growth remains crucial.  The actions set out in Enterprise 2025 focus on three main aspects:</p>  <p>  One: we are focused on achieving a significant uplift in the performance of enterprises based here in terms of innovation, export potential and productivity, and in attracting further investment;</p>  <p>  Two: we aim to focus investments in areas where Ireland can differentiate itself internationally &ndash; specifically education &amp;amp; skills; place-making; innovation and connectedness including trade &amp;amp; investment.  DJEI is working closely with DFAT in the development of a successor to our Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy and is engaged in the development of the successor National Planning Framework from the perspective of enterprise current and future needs;</p>  <p>  Three: excelling on getting the fundamentals right in terms of finance, cost competitiveness, tax environment and economic infrastructures.  The Government is confident that appropriate fiscal policies are in place that will help us to adjust to the economic effects of the UK&rsquo;s negotiated withdrawal from the EU over a period of two years or more.</p>  <p>  We are not blind to the potential implications arising from Brexit.  I secured additional resources in the recent Budget to support our enterprise agencies in their increased efforts to work with Irish and foreign owned companies in the context of Brexit.  In addition Budget 2017 introduced a suite of measures for agri-food, maintained strong support for the tourism sector with 9 percent VAT rate, and new schemes are under development relating to working capital.  One response may have been to reduce our ambition and the potential set out in Enterprise 2025, or to reduce the targets I set for our agencies over the coming year.  I do not believe that this would be the right response at this time. </p>  <p>  We will continue to focus on taking action in the right areas to support enterprise as set out in Enterprise 2025 &ndash; this does not change because of Brexit.  However, enabled by additional resources, the agencies will redouble their efforts in:</p>  <p> -  working with our Irish owned companies to grow scale and to compete effectively on international markets;</p>  <p> -  helping more Irish owned companies to export for the first time, and work with exporting companies to expand their international footprint beyond UK markets;</p>  <p> -  attracting FDI from a wider range of source markets &ndash; FDI that adds value to our economy;</p>  <p> -  helping a greater number of companies to invest in RD&amp;I for the first time and support already R&amp;D active companies to invest more in developing innovative products and services; and</p>  <p> -  helping locally trading companies to increase productivity, to innovate and to invest in management and skills development through the LEO network.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously we can expect that many fluctuating macro-economic, trade and employment forecasts will be produced between now and the UK leaving the European Union.

In our immediate response, the EU Affairs Unit of my Department exercised a dedicated overall coordination role across all of the relevant policy areas of the Department, and represented the Department in the work that is being undertaken at cross-Government level.  However, in light of the volume of work to date, my Department has since decided to augment these existing arrangements with the establishment of a specific Brexit Unit.  This Unit is headed up at Principal Officer level and will lead on the coordination of my Department's policy responses to Brexit including our approach to the negotiations within the EU and bilateral relations with the UK.</p><p>Moreover, immediately following the UK referendum result, I established a Coordination Group within my Department consisting of relevant enterprise, single market, and trade officials, together with the Chief Executive Officers of IDA and Enterprise Ireland to consider the short, medium and long-term issues arising for our stakeholders.  I chair this Group, and I will continue to do so as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response to Brexit.  In addition, my Department has also decided to establish a Senior Officials Group on Brexit, which will monitor developments across the Department on a regular basis at official level.  Furthermore, the Management Board of my Department is also co-ordinating my Departments&rsquo; own response across all its Divisions to the referendum outcome.</p><p>In regard to new posts created in State Agencies, the additional &euro;3million in Pay that I secured in Budget 2017 is targeted specifically to assist in our response to the evolving Brexit scenario.  It will enable the Department and its Agencies to recruit an additional forty to fifty staff to supplement existing staffing numbers<font color="#2F2F2F">.  In this regard, it </font>is proposed to distribute the additional &euro;3 million pay allocation across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority, as well as to support the dedicated Brexit Unit within my Department.  However, as the 2017 Revised Estimates Volume &ndash; or REV - is still being finalised it is not yet possible to be specific on the distribution of the additional posts across each Agency at this time, albeit that the 2017 REV will be published in early December by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>In the context of the additional resources being applied, it is also important to recognise that each Agency will be provided with an overall Pay ceiling within which they will have some flexibility to align their staffing resources to manage their overall operations and priorities, including Brexit-specific actions.  In addition some Agencies also have Own Resource Income which they may wish to utilise to support some Brexit-specific actions, be that to cover operational Pay costs or some Non-Pay costs, such as running promotional and awareness campaigns. <font color="#2F2F2F"> The additional Agency staff will be specifically tasked with assisting companies adjusting to the evolving challenges faced from Brexit, help enterprise clients to diversify into new markets, secure new business and explore innovation opportunities.</font></p></reply>

CETA is a comprehensive and progressive trade agreement between the EU and Canada.  It removes over 99% of tariffs that currently hinder trade between the EU and Canada.  It is expected to increase bilateral trade by &euro;12 billion per year, and to generate growth and new jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>  <p>  Given the position taken by Ireland and other Member States, the Commission submitted CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed Agreement.  That is one requiring both EU and individual Member States ratification.  As this process may take a number of years to complete the Agreement provides for provisional application.  Provisional application allows businesses and consumers to enjoy the benefits and new opportunities of the agreement as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Agreement has now been signed the next step is for the European Parliament to give its consent.  Should the Parliament give its consent, the Agreement will be provisionally applied.  The process of ratification can then commence in Member States according to their constitutional requirements.</p></reply>

Exchange rate fluctuations will pose real challenges for low margin exporting sectors that are reliant in whole or in part on the UK market.</p>  <p>  The volatility of exchange rates is clearly evident from developments over the last few months.  An initial slide in the value of sterling was followed by a stable period which was then followed by a further weakening of the pound only for it to rebound towards &pound;0.85:&euro;1 in recent days.</p>  <p>  Given Brexit is likely to represent a structural shift in the UK trading relations with partners, short medium and long term responses are needed for Irish business.  These include market diversification, cost reduction, value-add, innovation and price repositioning.  My Department and agencies are putting in place measures to address these issues for client companies and I would encourage all companies hit by these changes to contact the enterprise agencies concerning measures to mitigate concerns.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are also working on the issue of short term support for vulnerable but viable companies impacted by the Brexit referendum.   </p>  <p>  The objective of this approach is to design a tailored, targeted evidence based response to industry&rsquo;s real needs.  In this respect a structured dialogue with industry is currently ongoing and on conclusion of that dialogue I will, if appropriate, bring forward further proposals to address the ongoing concerns of Irish firms.</p></reply>

Almost &euro;12.0m is provided for emergency refuge and support services, a further &euro;4.6m is provided for other community based domestic violence support services and &euro;4.0m is provided for rape crisis centres. </p>  <p>  Tusla provides revenue funding towards the running costs of emergency refuge accommodation.  In the current year, Tusla is providing funding for 147 family units of emergency refuge spaces and eight family units of emergency non-refuge spaces.  This includes eight additional family units of accommodation; six additional family units of emergency accommodation in Dublin and Kildare and two emergency safe housing units in Sligo which were funded by Tusla in 2016.  The emergency domestic violence accommodation spaces in the Rebuilding Ireland - An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness will be in addition to those already supported by Tusla.  On foot of Budget 2017, Tusla will be increasing its investment nationally on  domestic violence services.  The level of increase will be set out in Tusla's 2017 Business Plan, which will be submitted to me shortly for consideration.</p>  <p>  The recommendation of the Council of Europe minimum standards document is for one refuge space per 10,000 adult female population.  With availability of additional units of emergency accommodation in 2016, Tusla data indicates that the current rate of provision will be 1.45 refuge spaces per 10,000 adult women. </p>  <p>  Tusla is engaged with a number of specialist domestic violence service provider organisations and other stakeholders about additional provision to support families in safe accommodation in 2017 and beyond.  Tusla&rsquo;s focus is on achieving the optimum use of emergency shelter accommodation and effective community based services to avoid in so far as possible the need for use of refuges by vulnerable women and families. </p>  <p>  My priority, and that of Tusla, is to ensure that the needs of women and children fleeing domestic violence are being met in the most effective way possible.  I am committed to continuing support for these vital services.</p></reply>

Pobal appraises and monitors the local planning and implementation of activities and outcomes of each CCC associated with my Department's funding, and supports CCCs individually and collectively.</p>  <p>  The CCCs support the delivery of the three national childcare programmes; the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Programme, and provide additional support to childcare providers working with children with disabilities under AIM.  The CCCs provide support and guidance to local service providers and parents in relation to the childcare programmes and support quality in keeping with national frameworks and policy objectives. CCCs are also available to co-ordinate and provide training to providers and offer support to families with regard to Early Years services within their respective catchment areas.</p></reply>

The Learner Fund was introduced in 2014 to provide support for existing childcare staff to achieve the minimum level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications requirement that was to be introduced in the new Child Care Regulations.  The Fund was later expanded to support existing pre-school leaders to up-skill to Level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications, which is now the minimum requirement for pre-school leaders delivering the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  The first two years of funding - 'Learner Fund 1' and 'Learner Fund 2' have now been closed to new entrants.  Funding of &euro;1.5m has been made available in 2016 to continue support to childcare workers pursuing level 6 qualifications in the context of the expansion of the ECCE programme.  This is available to childcare staff undertaking training with approved training providers.  Applications for this funding are made through the County/City Childcare Committees, who process payment on behalf of my Department.  As courses are currently in process, a final amount paid for 2016 is not yet available. </p>  <p>  I also intend to extend the Learner Fund to support childcare staff to achieve higher level qualifications in childcare, i.e.  Level 7 and Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications.  My Department, in association with the Department of Education and Skills and Pobal, intends to commence work as soon as possible on the development of an approved panel of Level 7 and Level 8 training providers, and a new Learner Fund application process.</p>  <p>  In addition, I hope to be in a position to make some funding available to those childcare staff who have already completed higher level courses entirely at their own expense.</p>  <p>  In relation to AIM, funding of over &euro;700,000 has been provided to the City/County Childcare Committees to deliver a suite of training modules to service providers to assist in implementing AIM; and, to date, &euro;20,000 has been allocated to Early Childhood Ireland.  The purpose of this funding to Early Childhood Ireland is to develop the Train the Trainer programme for the Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines published under AIM; and to roll out this programme to 60 participants.</p></reply>

This requirement is no different to the requirement contained in the 2006 Pre-School Regulations which the 2016 Regulations replaced.  Staff working in early years services have always needed to be vetted prior to being employed.  The difference now is that the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, introduced by the Minister for Justice and Equality and commenced on 29 April this year, provides that early years services (amongst other relevant organisations) cannot employ any person to carry out any work or activity, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of the person having access to, or contact with, children, unless the service has received a vetting disclosure from the Bureau in respect of that person.</p>  <p>  Two organisations are funded by this Department to process vetting applications on behalf of the early years sector.  These organisations are Early Childhood Ireland and Barnardos.  The Department understands that both organisations have been under considerable pressure during the last month due to the seasonal increase in applications.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;233,000 is provided by my Department to Barnardos (&euro;133,000 pa) and Early Childhood Ireland (&euro;100,000 pa) to provide Garda Vetting services to childcare providers. </p>  <p>  In light of the increased volume of work undertaken by these agencies as a result of the expansion of the ECCE programme, I have agreed to provide some additional funding to these organisations for the purposes of providing Garda Vetting Services to childcare practitioners and I expect this to be drawn down over the coming months.</p></reply>
