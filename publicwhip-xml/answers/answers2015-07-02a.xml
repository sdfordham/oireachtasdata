Gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of just over &euro;63 billion in 2009 to &euro;54 billion in 2014. </p>  <p>  Budget 2015 marked a turning point in our recovery when expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets and we were in a position to provide targeted increases for frontline services.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Spring Economic Statement (SES) a number of key economic and fiscal variables have been revised, with these changes lowering our forecast deficit in 2015 to 2.3%.  This will see Ireland exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure at the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  Now as we look forward to 2016, it is important that we plan carefully to ensure that we invest public money in prudent ways that will be of maximum benefit to society.</p>  <p>  The SES has outlined fiscal space of between &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion for 2016, half of which will be directed towards expenditure increases.  This will allow spending pressures, including demographic pressures in key areas, to be addressed and allow for new measures to further enhance public services.</p>  <p>  As the economy continues to recover, we will look to build on the significant and wide-ranging public service reforms implemented over recent years as these reforms will continue to play an important role in releasing further funds for reinvestment in key public services.</p>  <p>  In relation to requests for increased capital investment, I will shortly be publishing a new capital envelope for the period to 2020.  This will look to prioritise spending aimed at supporting and underpinning economic recovery and providing social infrastructure.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, managing the delivery of public services within agreed budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and Department.  My Department monitors voted expenditure throughout the year to compare drawdown of funds from the Exchequer against published expenditure profiles. At the end of May, total spending was &euro;116 million (0.5%) below profile.  As we move into the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact in 2016, it will be important that Departments continue to prudently manage delivery of services within their expenditure ceilings.</p></reply>

The network has a significant footprint in every county in Ireland.  The total number of service stations in the network is 657. Of the 657 service stations 100 are owned by Topaz.  The vast majority of the remainder are owned by franchisees who are individual small and medium sized businesses (SMEs).  </p>  <p>  In summary, this agreement achieves value for money for the taxpayer while also supporting a large network of independant SMEs who operate filling stations across the country.</p></reply>

For this reason, the capital allocations published in Budget 2015 included increased investment for social housing in particular, reflecting the Government's prioritisation of investment in this area.  They also provided for continued investment in Education, to meet demographic demands in our schools, and in Health to allow the HSE to progress a number of priority projects. </p>  <p>  In relation to funding for Government expenditure, as the Deputy is aware, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) issues Irish Government bonds which attract investment from institutions and individuals.  </p>  <p>  Monies raised through Government borrowing are paid into the Central Fund and used to fund Government spending as approved by the Oireachtas and such spending is on the Government's balance sheet, regardless of where it is spent.  It has never been the custom to link borrowing to specific projects as to do so would limit the flexibility of the Government in managing the State's finances.</p>  <p>  The PPP programme provides a framework which allows the Government to supplement its traditional Exchequer capital programme by procuring private sector investment and risk sharing in the provision of specific public infrastructure projects.  The use of private sector funding in the creation of the assets combined with the risk profile over the life of the project means that the upfront costs of these projects are not included in the calculations of General Government spending.  Currently, there are 8 PPP projects either in construction or in procurement with a combined value of approximately &euro;1.4 billion.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Finance and the NTMA - which lead on financing the State - have considered other possible approaches to increasing funding sources.  One of the Government's recent initiatives in this regard has been the establishment of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund which will harness both public and private sector sources of funding to provide commercial investment, including in public infrastructure projects.</p></reply>

Any changes in income tax provisions apply across the economy irrespective of whether a worker is employed in the public or private sector.</p><p>The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is the measure of price changes calculated by each Member State of the European Union.  The index is based on a harmonisation and standardisation of practices within the EU and the purpose is to allow for the comparison of different consumer price trends in the different Member States.  At present, just under 92% of the total Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket is included in the HICP.  The HICP includes 626 of the 634 items in the CPI basket with the main difference being the treatment of owner-occupied housing and insurances.  The HICP values in respect of the period 2008-2014 and the forecast values for the same index in respect of the period 2015-2018 are detailed below.<table><tr><th>Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Outturn</td><td>3.1</td><td>-1.7</td><td>1.6</td><td>1.2</td><td>1.9</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.3</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Forecast</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.2</td><td>1.1</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.7</td></tr></table></p><p>I should also point out that under the recently agreed proposals for the Lansdowne Road Agreement public service employees including those on annualised remuneration rates of &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000 will benefit up to &euro;1,000 on a full year basis from two increases in 2016 (January and September) in the Pension-related Deduction (PRD) exemption threshold.  In addition, those on annualised remuneration rates from &euro;24,001 to &euro;31,000 will benefit from a pay increase of 1% effective from January 2016.  Subsequently, with effect from September 2017 all public servants on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 will be increased by &euro;1,000.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-02a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200078#WRA01700"><p>At the outset, I wish to make clear that neither persons in civil partnerships or those who will enter into same sex marriages in the future are discriminated under any aspect of the public service pension schemes.  This view has been upheld in a recent Equality Tribunal hearing on this very subject in relation to a civil partnership.</p>  <p>  The public service operates a Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme.  This provides benefits to Spouses or Children of deceased members.  In summary, when a member dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of one-half of the former member's pension is payable.  Dependent children are also entitled to a child's pension of one-third of the spouse's pension for each of the first three eligible children.</p>  <p>  The original pre-1984 scheme, which was optional, did not allow for the payment of a pension to a spouse who married or had children post retirement.  Thus, the scheme allowed a refund of contributions if the individual had not been married up to the point of retirement. </p>  <p>  In 1984, a revised Scheme which extended eligibility for benefits to spouses who married or had children after retirement was introduced and membership was compulsory for all new appointees after that date.  Members of the original scheme, certain retirees and those who had not joined the original scheme were given the option of transferring to the revised Scheme.</p>  <p>  One of the benefits of the Revised Scheme was that the spouse of a post retirement marriage was eligible for a spouse's pension.  The disadvantage of the Scheme was that there was no facility for repayment of contributions on retirement if the individual concerned did not have a spouse and would not therefore be in a position to avail of any benefit under the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  For members who remained in the original Scheme there was an entitlement to claim a refund of contributions in the event that the member remained unmarried at the date of retirement.  Many members of the scheme availed of this option and received a refund.</p>  <p>  Across the entire public service, approximately 30,000 staff who were not members and an unquantified number who had been members of the original scheme opted not to join the new scheme.  Their reasons for doing so were presumably varied, including not expecting to get married, being in a relationship with a separated person who was not then able to divorce or that it was personally more beneficial to them not to join the scheme.  For example, prior to 1984 women were not required to join the pension scheme and pay contributions; some of those in the older scheme may have decided that continuing that arrangement was better financially for them.  </p>  <p>  In recent years, some individuals have sought to reverse the decision they made at that point and have sought a new opt-in.  More specifically, a number of people have argued that they could not have envisaged that same-sex civil partnerships would be legalised in the state. </p>  <p>  A fundamental element of any new opt-in would have to be that it would have be open to all applicants regardless of their reasons for not opting-in in the first place.  This would be required so as to avoid alternative claims of discrimination.  Every then serving and retired public servant who opted to remain in the old scheme or chose not to join either scheme would have to be given the opportunity to opt into the new scheme. </p>  <p>  Public service spouses' and children's schemes are structured on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members.  Given the passage of time since 1984 and the greater clarity those who opted out then will now have about their lives, it is eminently foreseeable that only those persons whose partners would benefit would opt in.  This would radically undermine the group insurance basis of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  This Department's position has always been that if decisions freely made about pensions or other matters could be reversed at any time this would have grave consequences for public administration.  Where changes have been made to pension schemes, individuals have only been allowed to opt in to the new arrangements at the time of the introduction of the new scheme.  This approach is in line with that of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</p></reply>

Workforce Planning plays a key role in identifying human resource trends and forecasting workforce gaps in the medium term across the Public Service.  </p>  <p>  The specific tools used for Workforce Planning in the public service are intended to encompass the main criteria that are relevant to anticipating and forecasting human resource requirements and also, where relevant, supply factors.  Where service needs reflect demographic trends, these are integrated into workforce planning models.  The information developed  from the aggregation and analysis of data in the workforce plans contributes to the development of HR policies and strategies designed to address gaps that are identified.  </p>  <p>  Within a civil service context, the area for which I am primarily responsible, Workforce Planning was introduced in 2011 as a tool to assist Departments and Offices to achieve optimal impact in the deployment of their staffing resources.  It is a continuous business planning process of identifying, shaping and structuring the workforce to maintain the workforce capability and capacity required by each Department and Office to effectively and efficiently deliver the organisation's objectives.  Through the use of Workforce Planning, Departments seek to address imbalances and trends, including those arising on a geographic basis through the development of human resource policies in areas including recruitment and mobility. </p>  <p>  Departments and Offices are currently in the process of developing their Workforce Plan for the next three years and this process has informed current recruitment policy.  In Budget 2015 it was announced that there would be a targeted programme of recruitment into the Civil Service to address service needs and a shortfall in key skills and this commenced in late 2014 and continues during 2015.  To this end recent competitions have been held for Executive Officer, Assistant Principal Officer, both open and inter-departmental and an open competition for Principal Officer. </p>  <p>  Redeployment has been and continues to be used to deal with geographic imbalances where surplus staff have been identified due to rationalisations, reorganisations, reconfiguration and restructuring of Civil and Public Service organisations.  Redeployment made a substantial contribution during the Moratorium to seeking to ensure that front line and essential services were maintained during a period of intense budgetary pressures.  To the end of May 2015, a total of 960 staff have been redeployed across the Civil and Public Service. </p>  <p>  A process of delegating sanction to Departments and Offices to make their own appointments, provided they remain under a designated pay ceiling, is currently underway.  The multi-annual pay ceilings are binding and it will fall to the Departments to deliver services within these agreed allocations for the period 2015-17.  This includes responding to emerging expenditure pressures over that period without recourse to additional Exchequer allocations.  To do so will involve commitment to ongoing reform and efficiency measures and reprioritisation of expenditure as appropriate. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Local Government sector, sanction in relation to staffing matters in local authorities has been delegated to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government within budgetary pay bill ceilings and the Department is supporting local authorities in completing their Workforce Plans.  I would therefore direct the Deputy to my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government for further information on the workforce planning process within the Local Government sector. </p>  <p>  As a fundamental element of public service reform, workforce planning across the public service will continue to be prioritised to ensure that public services are delivered effectively and efficiently and on a sustainable fiscal basis.  There will be a continued focus on the development of existing methodologies for workforce planning to ensure that key features of the process such as demographic developments and the balanced provision of public services on a geographic basis - consistent with appropriate standards of provision - remain central to the overall approach.</p></reply>

As for the final geographic location of the bodies affected by the Rationalisation programme, that was and remains a matter for the relevant Government Minister and Department to determine in the first instance, guided by the need to make savings and other administrative efficiencies of course.   </p>  <p>  For further detailed information, I refer the Deputy to a report on the Implementation of the Agency Rationalisation Programme, which is published on my Department's web site.  This Report shows that recurring annual savings of over &euro;15 million are accruing to Central Government, with a further &euro;2.8m in once-off revenue arising from the disposal of property. It also shows that further annual savings of the order of &euro;9m will be achieved by 2018, as the full year efficiency savings from some of the measures are realised, and additional net savings worth some &euro;40 million will accrue annually to the Local Authority sector on foot of the reform and rationalisation measures in Local Authority structures.   </p>  <p>  Regarding the formation of new bodies, which may from time to time be established by Government, location would typically be one of a number of factors to inform a business case.  I am sure the Deputy is aware, for instance, that in the case of my own Department, the new Civil Service Payroll Shared Service - which provides payroll, pensions and travel and subsistence payments to nearly 31,000 Civil and Public Servants - is located in three centres: in Galway, Tullamore and Killarney.  Indeed, I visited the Galway centre only last week to congratulate the staff on their work in bringing together into one place payroll administration that had previously been carried out in 18 individual pay centres.  This Reform initiative will generate considerable adminstrative efficiencies and is a good example of the type of positive change that is being embraced across the Civil Service and Public Service under the Government's Public Service Reform Agenda.</p></reply>

This action, which is strongly related to a range of other critical HR objectives in the Plan, is aimed at fulfilling the commitment to 'maximising the performance and potential of all Civil Service employees and organisations' and includes, in particular, the following:</p>  <p>  - Replacement of the current performance ratings scheme for the 2016 PMDS cycle with a new model of performance assessment that is focussed on identifying excellent performance, leadership potential and underperformance and that encourages regular and constructive feedback;</p>  <p>  - Development of the integration of PMDS with learning and development through, for example, focussed training for managers on the effective management of performance;</p>  <p>  - Continuation of the simplification of the performance management process by building on the ePMDS electronic system deployed in 2014 through the development and rollout of an eProbation system to manage the performance of new entrants.</p>  <p>   A key challenge across the civil service is the delivery of high performance and to fully engage staff and managers in the management and improvement of performance.  The Civil Service Management Board will in responding to this challenge continue to focus on seeking to enhance how performance is managed in the civil service.  In this context, the CSMB will - consistent with the appropriate action in the Renewal Plan - also oversee the introduction of a specific performance management system for Assistant Secretary grade in the civil service.</p></reply>

The Councils have heretofore discharged their responsibility through the River Suck Joint Drainage District Committee.   </p>  <p>  The most recent formal report submitted by the Committee to the Office of Public Works (OPW) shows that it expended almost &euro;142,000 in 2011.  This expenditure comprised routine maintenance works including the cleaning of drains and river bed, cutting back trees or other obstructions, weed control and, where possible, improving water flow.  The OPW has been advised  that the Committee has since expended &euro;136,000 in 2012, &euro;149,310 in 2013 and &euro;150,891 in 2014 on further maintenance works. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the River Suck Joint Drainage Committee was disbanded with effect from 1st January, 2015 on foot of Ministerial Order by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, as I have indicated, the ongoing maintenance of the channel and the funding of that work remains the joint responsibility of Roscommon County Council and Galway County Council. </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of its Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme in 2009, the OPW has provided significant funding under the scheme to Galway and Roscommon County Councils to enable them to undertake flood alleviation projects identified by the Councils within the River Suck catchment to address localised flood problems.  </p>  <p>  To date, nearly &euro;2.1 million has been approved to Galway County Council and over &euro;550,000 to Roscommon County Council for minor flood projects within this catchment.  Details of all the projects for which funding has been approved to local authorities under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme are available on the OPW website www.opw.ie. </p>  <p>  The OPW's core strategy for addressing flood risk in the  River Suck area, as part of the larger River Shannon Basin, is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study.  The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon Basin. Draft predictive flood maps are currently being produced by engineering consultants undertaking the Shannon CFRAM Study, on behalf of the OPW, in partnership with the relevant local authorities.  Public consultation days in relation to the draft flood maps for the study areas were held earlier this year and I am pleased to say that these were generally well attended.  National consultation on the flood maps is to take place in late summer/early autumn of this year, following which the flood maps will be finalised. </p>  <p>  The next phase in the CFRAM Study will then be the identification of appropriate flood risk management options for each significant risk area, following which Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) are scheduled to be prepared in late 2015/early 2016.  The draft FRMPs will then be the subject of public consultation before being finalised. Updates on the study are available on the Study website www.shannoncframstudy.ie. </p>  <p>  The FRMPs, when finalised following a public consultation process, will provide the basis for decisions regarding future investment by the State in flood risk management in significant risk areas, including those in the River Suck catchment area.  I would therefore strongly urge members of the public and other stakeholders to take part fully in the consultation process.</p></reply>

Public Procurement savings are necessary to enable public service organisations deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets that they must now operate.</p>  <p>  However, I would point out that reforms in this area are being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of SMEs.  The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting. </p>  <p>  In relation to SME participation in public procurement, recent analysis carried out by the OGP indicates that 93% of government procurement expenditure falls within the State and that 66% of this is directly with Irish SMEs.  </p>  <p>  The 2014 EU Directives on public procurement contain a number of provisions that are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.  These provisions include:</p>  <p>  - except in justified cases, turnover requirements will be explicitly limited to two times the estimated contract value;</p>  <p>  - acceptance of self-declarations for evaluating the capacity and capability until the award stage;</p>  <p>  - the promotion of e-procurement with mandatory electronic availability of procurement documents;</p>  <p>  - contracting authorities to comply or explain in relation to the division of contracts into lots;</p>  <p>  - Member States to provide the Commission with detail on SME participation. (Such monitoring can support consistent application across all Member States and ensure that the objective of greater SME involvement is being delivered.).</p>  <p>  These provisions will be reflected in the transposition which is underway.  </p>  <p>  I would also point out that the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), which falls under the remit of my Department, has accelerated some of these key measures in Circular 10/14 which issued in April 2014 including the requirements to tender on-line in an open and transparent process, reductions in bidder's turnover requirements, proportional and reasonable insurance requirements, and breaking larger contracts down into lots.</p>  <p>  The OGP supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland in building awareness of public procurement and supporting training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.  For example, last year the Office of Government Procurement supported two "Meet the Buyer" events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by over 1,100 suppliers.  Earlier this month, the 2015 "Meet the Buyer" event in Belfast was attended by approximately 510 suppliers.  The Office of Government Procurement also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SME's.  This year InterTrade Ireland also delivered a programme on consortia building to assist SME's to jointly bid for state contracts.  </p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to work with suppliers and business representatives on behalf of Government to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that public procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

In addition, to the equal opportunities policy, gender policy is also about setting strategic objectives at Department level.  Human Resources Management (HRM) policy areas are asked to incorporate gender equality into their HR strategies and policies.  Guidance material has also been produced on affirmative action 'Making Gender Equality Happen: Guidance on Affirmative Action in the targets contained in the National Women's Strategy 2007-2016 for the percentage of women in the grades of AP and PO in the Civil Service has already been well exceeded for both grades.</p><p>Recently, the Department of Justice and Equality, with the assistance of funding from the EU's PROGRESS programme and supported by my Department, has launched a pilot mentoring and leadership development programme to increase the number of women in the top decision-making levels of the Civil Service.  The pilot is cross-Departmental with female Principal Officers from each of the 16 Government Departments participating in the programme.  The participants are receiving executive coaching, mentoring and leadership development training which is focused at the competencies required at the Assistant Secretary General grade.</p><p>Notwithstanding the progress which has been made in increasing the participation of women in the work force, there remains a clear need to continue to increase female participation at senior levels in the Civil Service.  To this end, the Civil Service Renewal Plan contains a commitment to improve gender balance at each level by reviewing supports and policies to ensure these are impactful and measurable.</p></reply>

This Agreement provided inter alia  for the working of additional hours by public servants.  The extra hours under this Agreement,  is delivering an unprecedented and structural increase of almost 15 million additional working hours annually in the productivity of the public service at no additional cost and contributes significantly to the provision of public services at a time of significant resource constraints.  Additionally, the Government has allocated a further &euro;300 million in 2015 for additional recruitment mainly for frontline services in Health, Justice and Education to address critical service needs.  Both policy responses are directed at providing and supporting the ongoing provision of public services which are critical to those who are required to avail of such services and  are mutually supportive. </p>  <p>  More recently following discussions between public service employers and employee representatives regarding a successor agreement to the HRA, proposals for a new agreement, the Lansdowne Road Agreement, have been developed for an extension to the Haddington Road Agreement out to September 2018.  The productivity and reform measures provided for under the HRA, including the additional hours, form an integral part of the new proposals which are currently under consideration by public servants and I have no plans to alter that position.  I do not believe any such proposal would serve the interests of those who necessarily avail of our social services on a regular basis.  I should also point out that this Government's strong focus on assisting job creation has led to the reduction of the unemployment rate from around 15% in early 2012, to  9.7%, in May 2015 at a time when public service productivity has been considerable increased while the number of persons in employment was 1,929,500 in quarter one 2015, an increase of 41,300 (+2.2%) over 2014 alone.</p></reply>

The Lansdowne Road Agreement proposals which were recently agreed by employer and employee public service representatives represent an extension of the Haddington Road Agreement  up to September 2018, the terms of which will apply to all staff in accordance with the agreed proposals subject to ratification by the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</p></reply>

It should be carried out before Exchequer resources are committed.</p>  <p>  Economic appraisal involves a series of steps from objective definition and options exploration through to selection of the preferred option.  For significant expenditure proposals, it is important to consider overall Value for Money by quantifying, monetising and comparing all relevant costs and benefits for a range of options.  The aim is to determine whether the overall economic and social impacts for society outweigh the direct and indirect costs.  Reliable estimation of all the costs associated with completing the project is key e.g. construction, operations, maintenance.</p>  <p>  To account for the fact that money in the future is worth less than money now, an economic discount rate is used to convert future costs and benefits to present values.  There are different ways of determining the discount rate for economic appraisal. In Ireland, the social rate of time preference has been the main method used in recent years.</p>  <p>  Financial appraisal, as distinct from economic appraisal, focuses specifically on the project financial flows which impact on the public sector organisation and/or the Exchequer.  For example, this form of analysis is used in the financial comparison tests for Public Private Partnership projects and the discounting of cashflows in these evaluations is informed by the cost of Government borrowing.</p></reply>

The fiscal projections contained in the SES and the Stability Programme Update (SPU) are based on a technical assumption of a budgetary package of &euro;1.2 billion in 2016, split evenly between additional expenditure increases and reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p>  <p>  The fiscal forecasts in the SPU outline that in 2016, General Government Expenditure, excluding debt interest, is projected to be just under 32% of GDP and 37&frac12;% of GNP.  As a proportion of the overall economy, Government spending in 2016 will be roughly the same size it was in 2001.  </p>  <p>  Post 2016, the fiscal forecasts included in the SES and the SPU, and all related general government expenditure amounts and ratios, reflect a no-policy-change scenario from an expenditure perspective, other than provision being made for a &euro;300 million increase in gross voted expenditure per annum to offset demographic pressures. </p>  <p>  The production of fiscal forecasts reflecting policy beyond 2016 requires specific decisions on the allocation of fiscal space for each year.  Once there is visibility as to the exact quantum of fiscal space available each year, policy decisions will be required at Budget time on the allocation of the space between expenditure and tax measures.  Such decisions will take account of the prevailing economic conditions and Government's commitments to investing in public infrastructure and services.  As these resource allocation decisions are made by Government, the ratios in relation to general government expenditure, and their comparison with other EU Member States, will adjust accordingly.</p></reply>

Contracting Authorities cannot favour or discriminate against particular candidates and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.  The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies also identifies procurement as one of a number of activities requiring special attention in promoting good corporate governance.  It is the responsibility of the State Boards to satisfy themselves that the requirements for public procurement are adhered to and to be fully conversant with the current value thresholds for the application of EU and national procurement rules.  </p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to compliance, public bodies are subject, at the Comptroller and Auditor General's discretion, to examination regarding the economy and efficiency of their operations and the adequacy of the management systems that they have in place to appraise the effectiveness of their operations.  This includes their adherence to EU and National rules on public procurement.</p></reply>

This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions, i.e., 34.4% of all welfare expenditure, and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014.  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  The most recent change in the core rate of State pensions was in Budget 2009, when the State pension contributory was increased by 3.1% to &euro;230.30, and the non-contributory pension by 3.3% to &euro;219.00.  Both of these are the maximum personal rates, and there are increases for dependant adults which attracted similar increases at that time.  Core pension rates were not reduced in the period since then, despite significant pressures on Exchequer spending, and a period of significant deflation which has protected those increases in real terms from erosion by inflation.  This has had the effect of protecting older people from poverty, and all CSO figures show that those over 65 are significantly less likely to be at risk of poverty or deprivation than those aged under 65. </p>  <p>  The Department will spend &euro;227 million this year on the household benefits package for approximately 415,000 customers.  There were no changes to the household benefits package arising from Budget 2015.</p>  <p>  The recovery has allowed some leeway to increase spending in targeted areas, which is why I was able to restore a partial Christmas bonus last year, benefitting over 575,000 pensioners and 1.23 million welfare recipients in total.  I also increased payments for certain pensioners by increasing the rate of the Living Alone Allowance in Budget 2015 to &euro;9.00. </p>  <p>  Any decision to increase the rates would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p></reply>

Over 10,000 new tenancies have been processed since the start of the year, showing that landlords are accommodating persons under the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  The tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord.  The Department must verify the existence of a valid tenancy before a claim can be processed.  Where all the necessary information is available every effort is made to ensure that rent supplement claims are processed as quickly as possible.  It should be noted that under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), responsibility for new applicants with long-term housing needs transfers from this Department to the local authorities. HAP is now being rolled out in 13 local authority areas with further roll-out scheduled later in the year.  I have no plans to amend the conditions of the rent supplement scheme at this time.</p>  <p>  As previously advised to the Deputy, rent supplement, administered under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), is a statutory means-tested scheme which is payable at differentiated rates of payment, taking into account the applicant&rsquo;s means and accommodation requirements.  All income a person or couple has in terms of cash, property (other than the home) and capital are assessable as means.  This includes means derived from a cash settlement following separation, including that in lieu of the family home.  In the case of rent supplement, the person living in the family home would not qualify for the scheme as their accommodation needs are being met. </p>  <p>  The combination of the means test and awarding differentiated rates of payment is premised on ensuring that social welfare payments are paid to those most in need.</p></reply>

While my Office does not maintain a register of all such requests for meetings or invitations received, I can advise the Deputy that since 2014, I have attended some 100 meetings with a variety of individuals and groups, including meetings with representatives of those bodies under the aegis of my Department and other public representatives.

The Act provides that the Standards in Public Office Commission (the Standards Commission) will establish and maintain an online register of lobbying and oversee compliance with the legislative provisions.  The purpose of the register will be to make information available to the public on the identity of those communicating with designated public officials.  Persons lobbying will have to register with the Standards Commission and will be required to submit returns on their lobbying activities.</p></reply>

For too long, significant numbers of lone parents have been typecast, and confined to social welfare dependency. The best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment. The purpose of the reform of the one parent family payment is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment.  </p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports, such as back to education allowance, back to work enterprise allowance and community employment.  In addition, I was pleased to introduce the back to work family dividend in the last Budget.  This provides a significant incentive for families with children to move into employment, as recently reported by the ESRI. </p>  <p>  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. </p>  <p>  Any reversal of these reforms would delay this critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future. </p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to reverse the forthcoming changes to the one parent family payment. </p>  <p>  However, I look forward to examining the various supports available to all families, including single parent families, in the next Budget.  </p></reply>

A major problem facing governments was that authorities simply did not have the tools to manage their failure in an orderly manner. </p><p>To address this problem the European Commission proposed a common EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of banks facing difficulties.  This piece of legislation, known as the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) is currently being transposed by Member States.  A key priority of the BRRD is to separate banks from the sovereign and ensure they are allowed to fail with minimal disruption to the financial system and without reliance on taxpayer funds.</p><p>There are three pillars to the BRRD framework to facilitate a range of appropriate actions by authorities:  </p><p><b>- </b>Preparatory and preventative measures including reinforced supervision and robust recovery and resolution planning for major institutions; </p><p>- Early intervention measures which would include supervisory powers and implementing recovery plans; </p><p>- Resolution tools including appointing a special manager, sale of business, bridge bank, asset separation tools and the use of bail-in mechanisms.</p><p>The bail-in provisions are key as they will enable resolution authorities to write down or convert into equity the claims of shareholders and creditors of institutions that are failing or likely to fail.  This is an important means of ensuring that a bank s losses are absorbed by those who fund its activities and not taxpayers.  Where bail-in is not sufficient to cover a bank's losses additional funding can be accessed via a resolution fund. Resolution funds are financed by means of contributions from a Member State's banking sector, and will be built up over a number of years. </p><p>For Member States such as Ireland that are part of the banking union a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) will become operational from 1 January 2016 and will be backed by a Single Resolution Fund (SRF).  This fund will replace the national BRRD resolution fund, and  has  a target level of 1% of covered deposits of all participating Member States to be reached within eight years (approx.&euro;55 billion).  </p><p>It is acknowledged however that in the early years of the SRM, situations may arise where the SRF is not sufficiently funded by the banking sector to face a particular resolution action.  Consequently it was agreed by Eurogroup and Ecofin Ministers in December 2013 that there was a need to put in place a system by which bridge financing would be available as a last resort. It was agreed that  during the transition period, bridge financing will be available from national resources, backed by bank levies or from the ESM in line with agreed procedures.  It should be noted that bridge financing is still the subject of negotiation at EU level. </p><p>In conclusion, resolution tools such as bail-in were not available at the time of the Irish banking crisis and thus taxpayer funds were used to bail out bondholders.  The fact that we now have the legal basis to apply losses directly to the creditors of the bank should go a long way to reducing the likelihood of taxpayers contributing to future bank resolutions.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. </p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the  Group threshold  below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise. </p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these were last changed in Budget and Finance Act 2013 when they were reduced by 10% to their current levels with effect from 6 December 2012: </p><p><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child. </p><p><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. </p><p><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, </b>applies in all other cases. </p><p>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.  It should also be noted that the thresholds apply on an individual basis so that, for example, where there are two children the current Group A threshold of &euro;225,000 applies individually to each child in respect of gifts and inheritances from their parents. </p><p>I have said in response to a number of other recent Parliamentary Questions on this matter that I recognise that the recent growth in property values has implications for the liabilities that can arise from CAT. For this reason, I am reviewing the various aspects of this tax, including the lifetime tax-free thresholds, in the context of my preparations for Budget 2016 and the subsequent Finance Bill.  </p><p>I would, however, refer the Deputy to the existence of the CAT dwelling house exemption, which allows for a property to be gifted or inherited tax free when the beneficiary is already living in the home.  While certain restrictions and conditions apply to ensure its proper use, this exemption is designed to prevent cases of hardship or displacement for individuals who are home sharers and carers.  In cases where the dwelling house exemption applies, the tax-free thresholds are unaffected and continue to apply separately and are available to an individual to cover the value of other gifts or inheritances which he or she may benefit from over their lifetime.</p></reply>

Financial market developments in the euro area (outside of Greece) have been relatively calm in recent days, suggesting that the firewalls created and the governance changes made during the crisis are having the desired effect .</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with the other Member States, understands and empathises with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people which has been exacerbated over the last number of weeks by the uncertainty surrounding the programme negotiations.  This is why there has been a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece while also respecting existing commitments.</p></reply>

The Agency's role is that of a secured lender. Other than properties that have been enforced, all of which are listed on NAMA's website and which are managed by the appointed receivers/administrators, properties continue to be managed by their existing owners or their professional managers/agents.  NAMA, nonetheless, in accordance with its statutory obligations, takes a very close interest in their efficient management and sale with a view to maximising loan repayment and thereby protecting the position of the taxpayer.</p><p>I am advised by NAMA that the particular property referenced by the Deputy was sold, following a competitive open market process, by the duly appointed Receiver. NAMA did not sell the property.  As the Deputy will be aware, in cases of enforcement, receivers are appointed as agents of the borrower and are obliged to achieve the highest price possible on the sale of properties on behalf of the borrower.</p><p>The Receiver in this instance could not have accepted a lower bid for the property simply on the basis that the bid was received from a sporting organisation.  If he had done so, the Receiver could have been exposed to litigation.  It is important to note that there is no provision for NAMA, a receiver or an administrator to allow for the sale of assets at a price below the highest bid/market value as to do so would run counter to NAMA's commercial obligations under Section 10 of the NAMA Act to optimise the proceeds from its loan portfolio to the benefit of all taxpayers.</p><p>In the context of its overriding commercial mandate as delineated by Section 10 of the NAMA Act and its ancillary objectives under Section 2 of the NAMA Act, NAMA seeks to manage its loan portfolio in a way that complements the objectives of other public bodies, namely Government departments, State agencies and local authorities.  I am advised that in circumstances where such public bodies initiate engagement with NAMA and indicate an interest in acquiring a specific asset which is for sale, NAMA, wherever feasible, affords the public body first option on the acquisition at the independently assessed market value of the asset.  NAMA has widely publicised its policy in this respect and has facilitated a number of very important transactions in areas such as social housing, education and healthcare provision. Further information and examples of this engagement are available on NAMA's website at the following link: . It should be noted that this policy relates to transactions involving statutory bodies only.</p></reply>

As a designated person, NAMA is required to have procedures for the assessment and management of risks of money laundering or terrorist financing, based on a methodology proportionate in its detail and complexity to the size and nature of the business and the inherent risks of money laundering or terrorist financing.  NAMA has such procedures in place.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that when undertaking loans sales, which is a distinct activity from that of lending, NAMA conducts Anti-Money Laundering due diligence checks on a best practice basis in order to mitigate reputational risk. In all such transactions, NAMA is particularly interested in establishing the identity of the ultimate beneficial owners. Where such transactions include UK persons/entities, NAMA may make enquiries through the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  Where property sales are conducted by debtors, notwithstanding the funds from such a sale may ultimately be used to repay NAMA debt, NAMA is not a party to the property transaction. The relevant Anti-Money Laundering checks are conducted by the parties to the transaction, that is, the solicitors involved in the transaction and the financial institutions through which the funds may flow, as designated persons in their own right.</p>  <p>  I am informed that in this case the transaction was notified and cleared by SOCA in the UK as the purchaser was a PEP (politically exposed person).</p></reply>

The purpose of the revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers based on up-to-date rental values.  Following revaluation, there will generally be a much closer and uniform relationship between the rental value of a property and the commercial rates liability which applies to that property.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy.</p>  <p>  As part of the national revaluation programme, the Valuation Office published a new valuation list for the Limerick City and County Council rating authority area on 31 December 2014.</p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Valuation Act, 2001, as amended, provides that the commercial rates income of a local authority is capped in the year following revaluation, limiting the reasons for any increase in total local authority income from rates to the following: Inflation; Extensions to existing properties; and New properties coming on stream.  As a result, the revaluation of commercial properties in a local authority area is essentially a revenue neutral exercise concerned with the redistribution of the rates liability between ratepayers by reference to the net annual value of the commercial property they occupy. </p>  <p>  As a result of Section 56 of the Valuation Act, 2001, as amended, and the shift in relative values of various property types and uses between the late 1980's and the valuation date of 1 March 2012, some 65% of ratepayers in the Limerick City and County Council rating authority area have had a reduction in their rates liability while 35% have had an increase.  This is more or less in line with the outcome in other recently revalued rating authority areas.</p>  <p>  The trend of change in liability occurred across a range of property uses and is not confined to the categories of property to which the Deputy refers.  The question of the Commissioner adopting a different approach to the valuation of certain categories of property which receive public support does not arise as all valuations determined by the Valuation Office in all sectors are carried out solely in accordance with the valuation principles prescribed by section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001.  Government policy in relation to support of the areas mentioned does not play any part in the determination of values under the Act.</p>  <p>  Revaluation is not a new policy and is being carried out under legislation enacted in 2001.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his function under the Valuation Acts, 2001 to 2015 and the carrying out of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative.  The Act does not accord me as Minister any function in this regard.  I would not be aware of the values emerging for different sectors before the final valuation list is published and the legislation provides for an extensive appeals process.  The carrying out of a Regulatory Impact Assessment does not therefore arise.</p></reply>

Net Annual Value is the rent for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property.</p>  <p>  In accordance with well-established valuation principles and case law, various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value (NAV/rental value) of a building.  The most common methodology used is the comparative method, which as the name implies, makes direct comparisons with other similar buildings in the same rating area.</p>  <p>  In the absence of direct comparative evidence of value a method of valuation known as the Receipts and Expenditure method of valuation, where trading accounts are analysed to arrive at the Net Annual Value of the property, may be used.  This method of valuation or a variation on this method is frequently used in the valuation of licensed property for rating purposes.  In practice therefore trading data is used by the Valuation Office in deriving the value of a property. </p></reply>

This will provide a unique source of information on all Irish civil society entities, including charities as well as thousands of entities such as social enterprises, sports bodies, professional bodies and others.</p>  <p>  Benefacts, by collating all funding into a single repository, will also provide a key piece of data infrastructure that will ensure that taxpayers' monies are being spent in the most effective manner.

The review sought to assess all areas of public capital investment and to refresh the existing investment strategy and multi-annual envelopes to ensure that critical infrastructure deficits are identified and addressed.  We also need to ensure that our economic development prospects are enhanced by focussing our limited resources on the areas that can best support continued, sustainable and equitable growth.</p>  <p>  Informed by the review, new three year capital expenditure ceilings were published on Budget Day.  These ceilings included significant levels of investment to support Social Housing, Transport, Education, Health and the Enterprise Sector.  The results of the capital review will be set out in the Medium Term Capital Investment Framework Report that will be published shortly and will outline the capital envelope for the period to 2020.</p>  <p>  The capital envelope in the Report will seek to prioritise addressing infrastructure deficits and capacity constraints that could hamper economic growth and will provide further details in relation to certain programme spending identified as key to supporting and underpinning economic recovery and providing social infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  As regards Government development bonds, the Deputy will be aware that the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) issues Irish Government bonds which attract investment from institutions and individuals.  Monies raised through Government borrowing are paid into the Central Fund and used to fund Government spending as approved by the Oireachtas.  It has not traditionally been the custom to seek to link Exchequer borrowing to specific projects, as this limits the flexibility of the Government in managing the State's finances. </p>  <p>  That said, the PPP programme allows for private sector investment and risk sharing in the provision of specific public infrastructure projects.  Because of their funding and risk profile, the upfront costs of these projects are not included in the calculations of General Government spending and so this approach has allowed the Government to supplement its traditional Exchequer capital programme.</p></reply>

There is regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within agreed allocations.  I report a monthly analysis of spending trends to Government, and we publish information each month as part of the Exchequer Statement.  The position at the end of May showed a gross total expenditure underspend against profile.  The end-June position will be published later today as part of the Exchequer Statement.  Expenditure will continue to be monitored closely for the remainder of the year so as to ensure that our fiscal targets are met.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will note that in 2014, the economy expanded by 4.8% to become the fastest growing economy in Europe, with domestic demand and personal consumption now contributing to economic growth.  In relation to external issues impacting on the economy and in particular the situation in Greece, this is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance, Mr Michael Noonan.  However, I understand that  financial market developments in the euro area (outside of Greece) have been relatively calm in recent days, suggesting that firewalls created and governance changes made during the crisis are operating effectively.  This is a situation which will continue to be closely monitored.</p></reply>

The savings enabled by centralised public procurement will allow public service organisations to better operate within their budget allocations while maintaining or improving services for the public.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the Procurement Reform Programme total savings of &euro;100m over 2013 and 2014 have been reported by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) and its sector partners in Health, Local Government, Education and Defence.  The &euro;100m excludes &euro;16.5m in Utilities savings from OGP sourcing activity in 2014 as this would be regarded as a cost avoidance procurement benefit rather than a cash saving as the savings arise from beating inflation.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that, while the OGP and its sector sourcing partners can enable savings by putting frameworks and contracts in place, realisation of actual cost savings is dependent on public sector bodies availing of the new procurement arrangements.  This may not be immediately feasible due to limited contract termination arrangements or lags in moving to the new supply arrangements (e.g. stocks, change-overs, etc.).</p></reply>

The RDP has been developed on the basis of extensive preparatory analyses and stakeholder consultation, and while it does not include a measure directly providing assistance towards hill lamb or weanlings welfare, there are a number of relevant supports to the sheep sector and the suckler cow sector.  The Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) in the RDP will benefit sheep farmers and they will continue to be significant beneficiaries from the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme.  Knowledge Transfer Groups will also be run for sheep farmers, continuing and building upon the progress made to date under the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP).  Also, a series of capital investment schemes are being introduced under the TAMS II scheme, several of which will provide for sheep farmers.    </p>  <p>  The RDP also includes the targeted Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), a measure with an overall budget of some &euro;300 million, and which is aimed at suckler farmers producing weanlings.  As with sheep farmers, suckler farmers may also benefit under GLAS, ANCs, Knowledge Transfer Groups and capital investment supports under TAMS II. </p>  <p>  At present, all rural development funding has been fully allocated to schemes as set out in the Financial Plan chapter of the RDP , and there are no unused funds.  However, it is a seven year Programme, and so the situation will be kept under review and amended, if necessary, in consultation with the RDP Monitoring Committee and with the approval of the European Commission.  Any new measures would need a clear legal basis in the EU regulations, and would also need to respond to a detailed analysis and clear needs.  Implementation of the agreed Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 is currently a high priority for my Department.</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to pay farmers who graze and manage commonages in accordance with best environmental practice.  In order to put the best management regime in place, commonage advisers will walk and assess a commonage before drawing up one cohesive and integrated Commonage Management Plan covering all GLAS shareholder on that commonage.  Individual plans drawn up by different advisers would be unlikely to achieve the optimum environmental outcomes required and could represent a fractured approach to the management of these uplands.  It is worth noting that payments to commonage farmers have increased significantly from &euro;75 per hectare under AEOS to &euro;120 per hectare under (GLAS).   </p>  <p>  The GLAS approach to Commonages already provides for considerable flexibility.

On the contrary, I would like to remind the Deputy that I managed to secure an increased payment linked to the first 10 animals in each herd.  In per hectare terms, this results in a payment of &euro;142.50 for the first 6.66 hectares compared to &euro;120 thereafter.  This was precisely with a view to favouring smaller herds and has been widely welcomed by the stakeholders in the sector. </p>  <p>  7,851 herds with 10 suckler cows or less have applied for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme.  This equates to 27% of the total number of applications received for the BDGP, which is broadly proportionate to the level of participation of farmers with 10 cows or less in the last year of the Suckler Welfare Scheme and the Beef Genomics Scheme last year.  The scheme is fully subscribed and my priority now is to engage with the applicants and provide them with the support of my Department, Teagasc and the ICBF in order to ensure that they derive the maximum benefit from the scheme.</p></reply>

This group of victims has become known as the Disappeared.</p>  <p>  The families of the Disappeared have had to face a very cruel fate over many years, not only having lost a loved one, but having been denied for so long information regarding the burial places of their loved ones.</p>  <p>  With the support of the two Governments, the ICLVR has worked tirelessly over the past 16 years in pursuit of a solely humanitarian objective - to locate the victims&rsquo; remains in order that they may be returned to their families to receive a decent burial and that the families would then have a grave at which to grieve and to remember.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, in the course of its ongoing work the ICLVR uncovered the remains of two persons at a site in Co. Meath last week.  The discovery was made at a location where a search for the remains of Joe Lynskey was being carried out.  This location is also where it is believed the remains of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee may be buried.  While a positive identification of the remains found will take some weeks to complete, it is to be hoped that the suffering of the families of some of those who were disappeared will now be eased.</p>  <p>  While the remains of a number of the Disappeared have been recovered, there are still victims whose remains have yet to be located.  The ICLVR is continuing its work in relation to these cases and I can assure the families of my and the Government's full support for this ongoing humanitarian work.</p>  <p>  I know the Deputy will join with me in encouraging anyone with information that could help to locate those still missing to give that information to the ICLVR without delay.  I would emphasise that all information provided to the ICLVR is treated as strictly confidential and, by law, can only be used to locate and identify the remains of victims.  The Government remains strongly committed to the aim of locating these victims and returning their remains to their families.  I call on all others to help to bring it about.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-02a.373.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200088#WRL02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 143 to 146, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The inspection report by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on the child and welfare services in Louth Meath describes serious concerns regarding the standard of services being provided to children and families in the area. Tusla had notified me on the problems in the services prior to the publication of HIQA&rsquo;s report and has taken direct ownership of actions to improve the standards of service delivery.</p>  <p>  I can report that Tusla has intervened in the area immediately and that actions to improve management, oversight and quality assurance are well underway. They are being led directly at a senior level by the Chief Operations Officer. Additionally, a project social work team is being put in place to deal with the backlog and to assist with the implementation of national guidance and practice for the duration of the special programme.</p>  <p>  Tusla submitted an action plan to HIQA to address the recommendations following the inspection and this has been accepted.  On the most serious findings, Tusla has completed 22 out of the 46 actions, with the remaining 24 to be completed within dedicated time frames.  Of particular importance were the steps taken to ensure all children on the Child Protection Notification System had an allocated social worker and that improvements were made to record keeping and data collection.  Progress will be monitored by HIQA and officials in my Department to ensure these are completed.</p>  <p>  Issues were highlighted around resources and staffing in Louth Meath. This is being addressed at national level as a matter of urgency. Officials from my Department have already been engaging with Tusla on resources for the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. A submission on staffing and other resource issues is to be made in the near future.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that at the end of 2014, there were 1,451 open cases in the Louth Meath area, of which 620 were waiting on the allocation of a social worker. A key issue is the management of cases identified as needing a social worker while they are waiting. HIQA found the Louth Meath system to be poor and rated it as a significant risk. The management of the open cases is now being addressed and new systems have been put in place to review, monitor and manage cases waiting the allocation of a social worker in the Louth Meath area. Improvements to the recording of risks are also being made. A systematic approach piloted successfully at local level is being extended to the whole Louth Meath area.  Prioritisation of cases is not solely related to the risk involved and this will continue to be recorded separately.  Tusla is engaged in a review at national level on the system of prioritisation and how the recording of risk can be better reported.</p>  <p>  In relation to adults of concern in the community, senior managers at local level will undertake the task of reviewing the relevant information, with particular attention to any children that may be currently at risk.  Cases where there is an immediate risk are acted on without delay within the Duty Social Work team.  Otherwise, the cases will be risk rated and prioritised.  Where alternative resources are identified as a need, this is to be escalated to the Principal Social Worker in the first instance, and if necessary to the Area Manager.  In addition each county has in place a sex offenders risk management group.  This group is to assess the risks associated with convicted adults in the community.</p>  <p>  I do not consider the standard that was found in Louth Meath to be acceptable but I am encouraged by the positive and rapid response by Tusla in getting to grips with the problems.   It is also important for people to know that the positive aspects of the service were reported as well.  There was evidence of good practice and excellent interagency collaboration.  Good practice with children and families was observed by inspectors, who also found that many neglect cases were well managed by social workers and children's lives had improved from social work and family support intervention.  The majority of initial assessments were of good quality, based on detailed information from key sources and including the clearly expressed views of children.  Many children were found to have benefitted from the service.</p>  <p>  I have arranged to have regular meetings with Tusla senior management to monitor the significant progress required in this service area. The inspection report indicates that a number of the reforms in the national organisation of the overall service were in evidence.  I am determined that these reforms will continue to make improvements to the consistency of positive outcomes for children and families.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. </p>  <p>  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015. This was an important priority for the voluntary youth organisations that have a key role in the provision of quality youth work services for young people. </p>  <p>  In 2015, funding of &euro;6,945,538 has been allocated by my Department to For&oacute;ige to support the provision of services for young people including the local services provided by For&oacute;ige for young people who are at risk of disadvantage. The &euro;6,945,538  For&oacute;ige is receiving in funding in 2015 comprises &euro;2,551,737 under the Youth Service Grant Scheme, &euro;1,658,828 under the Young People Facilities and Services Fund (1 &amp;amp; 2) and &euro;2,734,973 under the Special Projects for Youth scheme.</p>  <p>  To support youth work activities at a local level, my Department operates a Local Youth Club Grant Scheme on an annual basis.  This Scheme is administered by Education Training Boards on behalf of my Department and is advertised locally each year. Despite the cuts in the funding available for youth services, the level of funding for clubs and groups under the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme has been maintained at &euro;1.035m each year since 2011. Some 600 local youth clubs benefit annually from the Scheme which is open to all local youth groups and clubs, including those run by For&oacute;ige. </p></reply>

The HPRA, in cooperation with the Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other international regulatory and law enforcement agencies, actively monitors the online movements and supply of prescription and illicit medicines to Ireland. The HPRA uses a range of enforcement powers to tackle this activity including seizing product and taking prosecutions. </p>  <p>  In April 2015, following coverage in the British press of the death of a young woman that was linked to Dinitrophenol (DNP), a warning was issued by the HPRA highlighting to consumers the dangers of taking slimming products purchased online. DNP is a highly toxic substance not fit for human consumption, which can cause serious harm and death.  Subsequently, following the death of a young Irish man suspected of having taken the same product, another warning was issued by the HPRA in June.  </p>  <p>  The HPRA&rsquo;s enforcement officers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are liaising regarding their respective investigations into the supply of the DNP product and the events surrounding this recent death.  They continue to work together to monitor and investigate instances of supply of illegal medicines via the internet. </p>  <p>  On July 1 the EU logo signifying the legitimacy of websites of pharmacies and medicines retailers was introduced in order to place controls upon, and reduce the significant health risk posed by, falsified medicines. Members of the public are strongly urged not to purchase medicines from an internet site which does not have the EU internet logo. In Ireland these controls apply to pharmacies/retailers involved in the internet supply of non-prescription medicines. The internet supply of prescription medicines continues to remain prohibited in Ireland on grounds of public health protection.</p>  <p>  I would reiterate the advice of the HPRA and recommend against the purchase of any prescription, or unauthorised medicines online. Further information can be found in the HPRA&rsquo;s leaflet, &ldquo;The Dangers of Buying Prescription Medicines Online&rdquo;.  For those already in possession of such products, consumers who feel any ill effects from taking any products purchased online should contact their doctor immediately. Any remaining product should not be taken.</p></reply>

As part of the authorisation application process the applicant company must submit evidence that the medicine meets clear and predefined standards of quality, safety and efficacy, relevant to its proposed therapeutic use.  This information is provided in a dossier and the type of data to be submitted is set out in EU Directives and guidelines.  The procedure for assessing applications followed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), as the national competent authority and regulator for human medicines, and the requirements for companies making applications, is set out in relevant Irish Regulations.</p><p>In relation specifically to the drug isotretinoin, the information provided by the pharmaceutical company was in line with these legislative and regulatory guidelines at the time, and has been updated regularly since then through renewals of the authorisation, periodic safety update reports, variations, and European-wide review, as already detailed in a previous response to the Deputy.  Roaccutane&reg; was first authorised for use in Ireland on 19 April 1983.</p><p>It is standard practice that there is regular correspondence between pharmaceutical companies and the HPRA in the context of all of these regulatory procedures and post-marketing safety monitoring.  Monitoring of benefits and risks of medicines takes place through a system known as pharmacovigilance (which includes review and evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports, published literature and post-marketing safety studies).</p><p>The applicable pharmacovigilance legislation that is and was in place since the first authorisation of Roaccutane&reg; in Ireland is as follows:</p><p><i>EU Legislation:</i></p><p>- Directive 65/65/EEC, amended by 75/319/EEC,</p><p>- Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, including Directive 2010/84/EU,</p><p>- Regulation (EEC) No. 2309/93,</p><p>- Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004,</p><p>- Regulation (EU) No. 1235/2010,</p><p>- Regulation (EU) No. 520/2012.</p><p><i>Irish legislation:</i></p><p>- S.I. No. 261/1966 Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, as amended.</p><p>- S.I.

No. 43/1996 Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1996, as amended.</p><p>- S.I. No. 540 of 2007 Medicinal Products (Control of Placing on the Market) Regulations, 2007, as amended.</p><p>All of this legislation is supported by a wide range of EU guidance documents.  Those involving pharmacovigilance requirements and guidelines for marketing authorisation holders and national competent authorities are currently included in a series of Good Vigilance Practice Modules (I to XVI). Previous guidance for pharmacovigilance was described in Volume 9A of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union &ndash; Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use.</p><p>Companies have an obligation to report suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of their products to the competent authority as a condition of their authorisation and the aforementioned pharmacovigilance legislation.</p><p>The national regulatory authorities in each EU Member State are responsible for gathering and evaluating national adverse reaction reports and in turn, submitting these reports to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is responsible for the overall pharmacovigilance activities across the EU.</p><p>Reporting of adverse events has been a function of the HPRA since its establishment as the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) in 1995 and prior to 1995 by the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB).</p><p>All reports of suspected adverse reactions received by the HPRA (and formerly the IMB/NDAB), either directly from healthcare professionals, patients and consumers, or via the marketing authorisation holder, were included in a chronological list of ADRs that was provided to the Deputy on 26 May 2015 in response to PQs 18759, 19167, 19177 and 19179-15.This listing includes information on age, gender and year, insofar as these details are available to the HPRA; however as previously highlighted, in most cases only limited information is provided to the HPRA in adverse reaction reports.</p><p>All ADRs included on the listing provided to the Deputy have been submitted to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the EMA, in accordance with the applicable legislation, guidance and timelines in place for reporting at EU and national level, as appropriate.</p><p>Since 2000, there have been eleven cases brought with respect to Roaccutane&reg; to which the HPRA/IMB was named as co-defendant.</p></reply>

Under the White Paper model, everyone will be insured for a standard package of health services and will have their choice of health insurer from a mix of private health insurers and a publicly owned health insurer. </p><p>Following publication of the White Paper, a major costing exercise, involving the Department of Health, the ESRI and others, was initiated. The purpose of the exercise is to examine the cost implications of a change to a multi-payer, universal health insurance model, as proposed in the White Paper on UHI. Draft results from the initial phase of the costing exercise were presented to me at the end of May and these are now informing deliberation on next steps, including the necessity for further research and cost modelling. </p><p>Ultimately, the UHI costing exercise is a major research project with a number of phases. The next phases in the costing exercise are likely to include deeper analysis of the key issue of unmet need and a more detailed comparative analysis of the relative costs and benefits of alternative funding models using bottom-up costing techniques. The draft results from the initial phase, as well as the plans for the next phase of research, will inform discussions with the Taoiseach and the Cabinet Subcommittee on the best long-term approach to achieving universal healthcare, and on the development of a roadmap for healthcare reform.</p></reply>

Delays in processing nurse registration applications are directly connected to the volume of requests arising from the current initiatives to attract and retain nurses in the Irish health services.  The Department of Health and the HSE are collaborating in sourcing several solutions to meeting the issues arising in relation to nurse recruitment and retention. </p>  <p>  The background to this issue is that nurses who trained in a country outside of Ireland and wish to work in Ireland are required to apply to register as a nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  In assessing an applicant for registration, to protect the public, the NMBI seeks evidence from applicants of comparable standards of education and practice.  According to the NMBI the timeframe for the completion of the assessment of qualifications for registration takes up to a maximum of 90 days provided all necessary documentation has been supplied by the applicant. </p>  <p>  The main difficulty to expediting timely applications, as reported by the NMBI, is that of delay or failure by the applicant or third parties to furnish the necessary documentation required to assess eligibility for registration.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, following assessment of qualifications by an applicant, may require an applicant to undertake a six to twelve week period of adaptation and assessment.  A period of adaptation is designed to make up for differences in education and ensure competence for working in the Irish health service.  If this adaptation is required it must be successfully completed as a pre-requisite to registration. </p>  <p>  The NMBI is processing all applications as quickly as possible, while ensuring appropriate procedures and checks which are designed around protection of the public.  </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that officials of the Department met with the President and the Chief Executive Officer of the NMBI last week to discuss a range of operational issues including the current delays in Registration.  A further meeting between the Department of Health, HSE and Nursing Homes Ireland is scheduled for this week.  The NMBI is keeping the current situation under review and the Deputy may wish to note that this week approval was granted to recruit 3 clerical officers.</p></reply>

Talks are ongoing between the US and Cuba with a view to the normalisation of relations between the countries, and I believe that these are advancing in a promising manner. On 1 July the reopening of bilateral embassies was announced by the US and by Cuba. The US embargo against Cuba is codified in legislation passed by the US Congress and President Obama has indicated his willingness to engage with Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo, which we welcome.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding the US embargo are long-standing and clear and were set out in the United Nations on 28 October last year in our support for the relevant resolution at the UN General Assembly. We are firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of Cuba&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people. The recent UN debate also recorded continued concerns and criticisms regarding governance and human rights in Cuba.  It was noted that while the US embargo has a damaging effect on the Cuban economy, domestic Cuban economic policy seriously hampers its own economic development. Together with our EU partners we have urged that the package of economic and social reforms adopted by the Cuban Congress in August 2011 be extended and implemented in a manner that will address the key concerns of the Cuban population. I urge the Cuban authorities to bring about real improvements in all areas mentioned, and to grant its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms.</p>  <p>  At the April Foreign Affairs Council, EU Foreign Ministers agreed to continue to support the ongoing reforms in Cuba and are working on the negotiation of a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Cuba. Ministers also welcomed the restoration of relations between the US and Cuba, and I made it clear in my intervention that Ireland sees the removal of Cuba from the US government&rsquo;s state sponsors of terrorism list and the lifting of the embargo as vital steps to facilitate an opening of the island&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people.</p>  <p>  The historic developments of recent months have seen considerable progress in US-Cuba relations. We look forward to the ending of the embargo with the removal of all remaining inhibitions to trade and contact with Cuba. </p></reply>

Skillnets, the State funded industry-led training facilitator, includes two networks who provide training for Meat Industry Operatives - the Taste4Success Skillnet and Food and Drink Industry Ireland Skillnet.</p><p>  The Taste4Success Skillnet have delivered courses specifically for operatives in the meat industry, including an intensive 20 week course in Food Industry Skills: General Knife Skills; Food Industry Award in Beef and Pork Butchery Skills &ndash; FDQ/EQF &ndash; Level 3 Award; Operative skills &ndash; various operative skills; Supervisor Skills &ndash; Beef and Pork Butchery.  During 2015 they plan to deliver further knife and technical skills at various levels for member companies and Job Seekers looking to get into the sector. </p><p>  Food and Drink Industry Ireland (FDII) Skillnet has invested a significant amount of time around the development of a traineeship programme for knifing and boning skills. The key companies they have been working with are ABP, Kepak and Dawn Meats. There are certain elements of the programme that remain to be finalised, however it has not been possible to progress as the companies have not committed the requisite experienced knifers and deboners to deliver the training on-site.</p><p>  With regard to the question of apprenticeships in this area, it should be noted that, by its nature, apprenticeship is an employer-led initiative. Following on from the recent Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland, a new Apprenticeship Council was appointed by me in November 2014. The Council is made up of a wide variety of stakeholders and is industry-led. In January 2015, the Apprenticeship Council formally invited proposals for new apprenticeship programmes from consortia of enterprise, professional bodies and education and training providers. Over 80 separate proposals were received by the deadline of end March. These proposals have been evaluated by the Council and recommendations have, this week, been received by my Department for consideration. No proposal was received to develop a new apprenticeship for operatives in the meat processing industry.</p></reply>

Those who are at the higher functioning levels would be expected to be taught the full curriculum, including Irish, while those at lower functioning levels may be exempted from learning Irish where their circumstances meet the criteria for the granting of an exemption.</p>  <p>  The criteria for the granting of exemptions from the study of Irish at primary (circular 12/96) or post-primary (M10/94) are similar. The authority to grant exemptions has been delegated to school management. The parents in this case should apply to their child's post-primary school. Delay on the part of parents in applying for an exemption on behalf of their child should not by itself cause the application to fail where otherwise the child's circumstances fully meet the criteria for an exemption.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently finalising a review of its exemptions policy at primary and post-primary levels.</p></reply>

With such skills and knowledge, it is hoped that our young people will make appropriate choices so that this informed approach will help to reduce the incidence of obesity in our young people.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising guidance for schools about measures to promote healthy lifestyles. This guidance encompasses measures to promote healthy eating, healthy vending, as well as the promotion of P.E. and Physical Activity. The guidance has been drafted in consultation with the Department of Health and the HSE.</p>  <p>  In co-operation with schools, my Department is also promoting physical activity through the P.E. curriculum and is supporting extra-curricular physical activities through initiatives such as the Active Schools Flag.</p>  <p>  This emphasis on physical activity is an important complement to the measures in place to promote healthy eating among our students.</p>  <p>  But I must state that schools can only do some much. Their efforts and policies for healthy eating need to be complemented by the students' families and the community.</p></reply>

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website.  In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions. The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeal procedures are set out in the published staffing arrangements. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012). The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.</p>  <p>  We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect pupil teacher ratios. Between this year and last year this has involved an increase of around 2,300 teachers in our primary and post-primary schools. This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.</p>  <p>  While there has been a moratorium on recruitment across other sectors in the public service, this did not apply to teaching and shows the commitment this Government has to educating our future generations.</p></reply>

The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply. With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.</p><p>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). </p><p>Since the establishment of the PRTB, over &euro;30 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation. Over 167,000 inspections have been carried out in this period. Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations. Fines for non-compliance with the regulations were also increased; the maximum fine increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.</p><p>In relation to the level of sub-standard housing being rented on the private market in Dublin, the high rate of non-compliance found as a result of inspections by Dublin City Council and reported on recently, reflects the fact that the inspection effort is targeted at the very properties most likely to be in breach of the standards. A Red C survey undertaken last year as part of the DKM report for the PRTB found that less than 10% of tenants surveyed were dissatisfied with the condition of the property.</p><p>The idea of certification has been proposed before and there is merit in the proposal. A 2014 report from DKM Economic Consultants, &lsquo;<i>The Future of the Private Rented Sector&rsquo;</i>(commissioned by the PRTB), put forward a number of options in relation to improving the quality of the rental stock. These include:</p><p>- improving the enforcement of standards by local authorities by prioritising those properties more likely to be in breach of the required standards, and</p><p>- in time, moving to a model where there would be a responsibility on the landlord to produce a certificate of compliance every three years.</p><p>In the short term it is my intention to promote best practice in implementing the regulations across the local authorities. The possibility of shared services across local authority areas is also to be explored. The regulations will be reviewed this year and the potential role of certification will be considered as part of the review.</p></reply>

I have been informed by IFI that from the first discovery of Dace in the tidal waters at St. Mullins, in 1992, the species had spread over 70km upstream, to near Vicarstown and upstream of the confluence of the Barrow Navigation and the Barrow Line of the Grand Canal by 2006. At present, the species is firmly established throughout the river and navigation and there are no practical measures that can be taken to control or eradicate this species where it is already present in abundance.</p>  <p>  While Dace is a valuable angling species for many anglers in certain freshwaters, including the River Barrow it is acknowledged that the species can prove to be a nuisance to game anglers targeting brown trout and to a lesser extent salmon, in waters where it is present.</p>  <p>  The presence of Dace in the Barrow system pose an increased risk of spread to interlinked waters and the primary approach of IFI in this regard is to prevent its spread outside of systems where it is already established, such as the Barrow.</p>  <p>  IFI have conducted a number of surveys in recent years to monitor for the spread of Dace into the Grand Canal system.

The purpose of the register will be to make information available to the public on the identity of those communicating with designated public officials. Persons lobbying will have to register with the Standards Commission and will be required to submit returns on their lobbying activities.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a partnership between Government and commercial telecommunications companies.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER.</p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers plan to deliver high speed broadband services. The AMBER area on the map shows the target areas for the State intervention. All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention.</p><p>Based on information provided by commercial operators 94% of Baltinglass West, 100% Baltinglass East, 100% Blessington, 96% Dunlavin Upper, and 58% Dunlavin Lower Co Wicklow, 100% Athy, 100% Naas West and 100% Naas East Co Kildare will be covered by the commercial sector. The remaining 6% of Baltinglass West, 4% Dunlavin Upper and 42% Dunlavin Lower will be part of the State intervention.</p><p>Members of the public should consult the map to establish for themselves the precise location and status of their individual premises.</p><p>More generally I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to 33,686 premises to date in Co Wicklow and 55,272 premises in Co Kildare, with a further 12,564 in Co Wicklow and 12,516 in Co Kildare expected to be served. The remaining 16,574 premises in Co Wicklow and 20,536 in Co Kildare will be covered by either commercial investment or through the proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>Intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area. Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.</p><p>I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take 3-5 years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected.</p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in Ireland.</p></reply>

This figure includes meetings with representatives of those bodies under the aegis of my Department and with representatives of other organisations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 has recently been enacted by the Oireachtas and will commence on 1 September 2015.  The Act provides that the Standards in Public Office Commission (the Standards Commission) will establish and maintain an online register of lobbying and oversee compliance with the legislative provisions.  The purpose of the register will be to make information available to the public on the identity of those communicating with designated public officials.  Persons lobbying will have to register with the Standards Commission and will be required to submit returns on their lobbying activities.</p></reply>

The Park is included in the United Nations List of National Parks and Equivalent Reserves and carries a number of important conservation designations.</p>  <p>  I understand that a person recently approached a staff member at the Park in connection with the proposal raised by the Deputy and was advised to formally submit a proposal to my Department. That submission is awaited. As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department frequently receives proposals for the development of recreational and business enterprises in the Park, each of which must be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s obligations to manage and care for this natural heritage property in an appropriate fashion, having particular regard to underlying conservation imperatives.</p></reply>
