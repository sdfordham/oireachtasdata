As there have been no plans to carry out material alterations to any of these protected structures my Department has not had the requirement to meet with the local authority in relation to these buildings within the last five years. I can confirm that as part of the ongoing process of managing the Defence property portfolio my Department monitors the Record of Protected Structures on an ongoing basis.  </p><p>  At present Conservation Architects are employed by my Department in relation to two projects, namely the restoration of the North Accommodation Block in McKee Barracks which is a protected structure, and the construction of a Military Archives Facility in Cathal Brugha Barracks. In most instances where external design teams are employed by my Department, the teams consists of an Architect (conservation qualified as necessary), a Structural Engineer, a Services Engineer and a Quantity Surveyor.</p><p>  When it is proposed to demolish a building in a Defence Forces installation an application is submitted to my Department by the military authorities &ndash; each application is considered on its merits following consultation between officials in my Department and the Defence Forces Corps of Engineers before a final decision is made.    To date no protected structures have been demolished by my Department or the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

Civil Defence has a wide range of equipment available to the organisation to assist in responding to the effects of flooding and other forms of severe weather. This includes 88 Boats; 47 Fire Tenders; 9 Floating Pontoon Units; 130 Four Wheel Drive vehicles; 2 Tracked All-Terrain vehicles and specialist equipment such as portable pumps.   At local level, under the Framework for Major Emergency Management, Civil Defence is very much integrated into the emergency response arrangements of local authorities, who have primary responsibility for severe weather response.   In addition Civil Defence also provides supports to the Garda&iacute; and HSE in their efforts to combat the effects of severe weather on communities.</p><p>  At national level Civil Defence, along with the Defence Forces, is part of my Department&rsquo;s representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning.</p><p>  Civil Defence training programmes, which include courses such as Water and Flood Awareness and Flood First Responder training, are intended to support the organisation&rsquo;s ongoing involvement in severe weather response.</p><p>  In that regard I want to compliment the over 500 Civil Defence volunteers who assisted the frontline emergency services in dealing with severe weather in many parts of the country in recent months. Civil Defence volunteers were engaged in a wide range of activities including evacuating people from flooded homes, water pumping, sandbagging, erecting flood barriers, monitoring water levels and transporting patients.</p><p>  Since 2011, in spite of the overall budgetary situation, I have been successful in maintaining the allocation available for Civil Defence at more or less the same level. I have allocated &euro;4.240 million for Civil Defence programmes in 2014. I will continue to ensure that an adequate level of funding is made available through the Civil Defence Branch of my Department to support Civil Defence efforts across the country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-25a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032500053#WRA01700"><p>Firstly I would like to again extend my sympathies to the families of the deceased.There have been three separate official investigations into this tragic accident.  The first of these was conducted by the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Transport. Their Final Report was published on 24 January 2012 which set out their findings. It found that the probable cause of the accident was the spatial disorientation of the instructor/pilot in conditions of poor visibility resulting in controlled flight into terrain.  In May 2012 a Coroner&rsquo;s Inquest was held into the deaths of the two crew members.  The jury recorded an open verdict in relation to the instructor pilot and a verdict of accidental death in relation to the cadet.</p><p>  The third investigation was a military Court of Inquiry which was convened by order of the Chief of Staff on 26 July 2012 and produced its report on 17 January 2013. The Court of Inquiry&rsquo;s findings are consistent with the earlier investigations, namely that the probable cause of the accident was the spatial disorientation of the instructor who was piloting the aircraft in conditions of poor visibility at the time. </p><p>  I received a series of correspondence from the family in which allegations were made in respect of a wide range of issues to do with the investigation of the tragic accident.  I sought the advice of the Attorney General in this regard.  I have fully considered the matter in the context of this legal advice and I am satisfied that a further investigation is not warranted into any issues relating to this tragic accident.  I informed the family late last year of my decision in that regard.  Officials from my Department also met with the family in early January to convey my decision and afford the family the opportunity to discuss their concerns. I have arranged to meet with the family again later this week.  </p><p>  I understand that the family feels that the content of the Court of Inquiry report introduces issues and opinions which, in their view raises questions concerning their son&rsquo;s role in this tragic event.  For the record, I would again like to reassure them that this line of argument is not supported in any report and has never been given any official credence.  All of the reports agree that Cadet Jevens bore no responsibility of any kind for the accident.  On 27  February 2014 a claim in respect of solatium and funeral expenses was heard before Judge Fullam in Galway Circuit Court. </p><p>  Solatium refers to an amount of damages that can be awarded to the dependants of a deceased person. A Statement was read out in court on my behalf admitting the State&rsquo;s liability for this tragic accident and an agreed sum in respect of solatium, headstone and funeral expenses was ruled.</p><p> There are 2 further cases in respect of this accident which relate to alleged negligence and personal injuries which have not yet been dealt with. As these matters are <i>sub judice</i>, it is not appropriate to make any comment at this time.</p></reply>

In the period since his appointment on 7 November 2012, a number of meetings have taken place involving Mr. McCourt and senior officials from the Department of Defence.  In addition, there is ongoing contact between staff from the Office of the ODF, the Defence Forces and the Department to address issues as they arise.  Meetings are arranged at official level on a regular basis to progress issues arising from cases investigated by the ODF.  </p><p>  Following the ODF&rsquo;s most recent meeting with senior officials in my Department, I expect to meet him formally early next month.

In that regard I would like to take this opportunity to thank Minister of State Tom Hayes for the constructive role he played in progressing the sale of the Barracks to the Council. In relation to the future of the Barracks,  South Tipperary County Council are developing a Master Plan for the whole site in consultation with some other state bodies who have expressed an interest in the site. In this regard I understand that discussions have taken place with the Office of Public Works (OPW)/Garda Housing, Limerick IT and Tipperary Education and Training Board (formerly the VEC). I understand that the discussions with the OPW/Garda Housing relate to the possible provision of a District Headquarters Station on the site. Any future decision on the provision of this facility will of course be dependant on available funding from the OPW.</p></reply>

Moreover, in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in EU Battlegroups, the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 has not in any way impacted on the triple lock mechanism. Any deployment of Defence Forces personnel to an overseas operation as part of a Battlegroup would be subject to the &ldquo;Triple Lock&rdquo; &ndash; UN Mandate, Government and D&aacute;il Eireann approval in accordance with the Defence Acts 1954 &ndash; 2011.</p></reply>

As I have mentioned earlier an assessment of a select group of properties in the Curragh Camp is being completed. This assessment will inform the process of planning for the long term military use of these properties. These properties were formerly used as married quarters.  The assessment will provide the Department with a cost per unit for the redevelopment of the properties for military use and will inform a decision on whether it is economically viable to restore and use the properties.  The expectation is that given the currently unoccupied properties are for the most part uninhabitable with many in extremely poor condition the cost of refurbishment is likely to be significant. </p><p>  As these properties are within the Curragh Camp the factors other than the cost of refurbishment per unit that will need to be considered in deciding whether or not to retain properties include:</p><p>  - Proposals for the redevelopment of the Camp generally in order to improve the overall layout of the facilities.</p><p>  - The requirements for Single Living In (SLI) accommodation within the camp both presently and into the future.</p><p>  - Their potential for military use taking account of their configuration both internally and externally.</p><p>  In addition, any restoration programme will be dependent on the prioritisation of capital projects generally across military barracks in line with available funding.  </p><p>  I will wait until I have received the results of the assessment before I make a decision on how to proceed.  However, I must emphasise that any proposed development of former married quarters property at this key military location must in the first instance be considered from the military requirement perspective,  therefore I do not at this time consider that it is appropriate to engage with other agencies regarding the future use of these properties.</p></reply>

However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. </p><p>  A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. </p><p>  In relation to non-security related emergencies, whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role.</p><p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area. </p><p>  The Defence Forces are also represented on the eight Regional Working Groups that have been established under the Framework and, on an ongoing basis, designated members of the Defence Forces, based around the country, act as Liaison Officers to Local Authorities. </p><p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments in response to emergencies and natural disasters. </p><p>  In this regard, the Defence Forces hold a wide range of engineering and transport plant and equipment for military purposes. All such plant and equipment suitable for use in emergency situations is made available as the need arises.</p><p>  In relation to the Naval Service, all vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that, in addition to their fishery protection role, they also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and Search and Rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard, amongst other duties while on patrol. These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction. </p><p>  The role of the Air Corps includes the provision of an emergency inter-hospital Air Ambulance service in support of the HSE.  It is also supporting the HSE in a pilot emergency aeromedical support service operating primarily in the West of Ireland.  The Air Corps also has a maritime surveillance function undertaken by its maritime patrol aircraft and both it and the Naval Service provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that Defence Forces personnel have a modern and effective range of equipment, including telecommunications and logistical equipment, needed to fulfill all roles that are assigned to them by Government in any emergency situations that may arise.</p></reply>

In relation to the naming of the two new Naval Service ships, I considered that the policy for naming the ships should be examined. In doing so, I was of the view that the time was right for a change in our traditional approach in order to reflect a more modern and inclusive Ireland.  I came to the view that the naming of the ships after world renowned Irish literary figures will facilitate greater recognition for our Naval Service when they are operating in the international maritime domain and when they visit foreign ports.</p><p>  It is my view that the names LE Samuel Beckett and LE James Joyce portray a very strong sovereign link between the Irish State and the Naval Service and set the tone both domestically and abroad in reflecting on a more modern Ireland and Naval Service.</p></reply>

The Equitation School has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years and, through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse.  Army riders competing on Irish bred horses provide an instantly recognisable symbol of Ireland at prestigious international events.  In addition to its competition activity, the Equitation School continues to support the Irish horse industry and it encourages breeders and producers, who may have horses suitable for top-level competition, to have them assessed by the School with a view to their purchase or lease. I believe that the Army Equitation School is an emblematic feature of the Defence Forces and that it plays an important role in the promotion of Irish horses and the Irish horse industry.  There are no plans to make changes to the operation of the Army Equitation School.</p></reply>

Since then, there has been significant progress made in implementing its recommendations.  New organisational structures for the Reserve were introduced at the end of March, 2013 and a large number of under-strength Units have been consolidated into a smaller number of full strength Units.  In addition, the way in which Reserve Units are organised has fundamentally changed.     Under the new structure, Army Units within the Defence Forces have both Permanent Defence Force (PDF) and Reserve Defence Force (RDF) components, as opposed to the separate parallel structures that previously existed.  This revised structure has improved access to equipment, expertise and appropriate training for members of the Reserve.  It has also allowed for a significant reduction in the number of PDF personnel required to administer and train the Reserve on a full time basis.     </p><p>  The Reserve budget has been rebalanced and funding previously allocated to gratuities has been redirected to increase the amount of paid training available to the Reserve.  This will ensure that the revised organisational strength ceiling of 4,069 personnel is sustainable within the prevailing resource envelope.  The Army Reserve now has an establishment of 3,869 personnel and the Naval Service Reserve has an establishment of 200 personnel. The implementation of other recommendations is ongoing and these changes will ensure the continued viability of the Reserve.  These reforms will lead to a more streamlined, fit for purpose organisation with a more cohesive relationship between the PDF and the RDF.  Ultimately, the recommendations of the VFM Review that are being implemented are intended to enhance the overall capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with a broad range of contingencies.  </p><p>  Information in relation to the numbers of effective members of the reserve are currently being compiled following the reorganisation.  While this process is ongoing as records from units are updated and reconciled on the personnel management system, it is not possible to provide an up-to-date fully accurate figure for the current strength.  The best estimate based on the returns reconciled to date is that the effective strength of the Reserve is in the order of about 2,500.  The military authorities plan to induct up to 500 personnel to the Reserve (both Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve) in 2014.  This will occur simultaneously with a recruitment campaign for the Permanent Defence Force and takes account of training capacity required to cater for these new personnel.  I envisage that further recruitment to the Reserve will take place in 2015.</p></reply>

On 25 June 2013, the Government agreed to continue to provide seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with ISAF for a further period from July 2013, subject to ongoing review by the Minister for Defence.  On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising the establishment of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The UN mandate for this mission was most recently renewed on 10 October 2013, and will fall to be renewed again on 31 December this year. As of the 20th   February 2014, ISAF has a current strength of approximately 52,700 personnel drawn from 49 Countries. These include 21 non-NATO partner countries, including Sweden, Finland and Austria.  In March 2011, the transition process whereby the Afghan security forces would gradually take on more security responsibility from ISAF was launched.

This process is due to be completed at the end of 2014, when ISAF&rsquo;s mission will end. </p><p>  Ireland has participated in ISAF in Afghanistan since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force.

The seven (7) personnel currently serving with the force are all located in ISAF HQ, Kabul and work in staff appointments in planning and administrative roles.  </p><p>  Defence Forces participation in all overseas missions is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The overall drawdown of ISAF personnel is currently underway and the withdrawal of the Defence Forces personnel will be coordinated in this context. While it is anticipated that Irish personnel will complete their service with the mission in September 2014, this will be kept under review in the context of the current proposed follow on training mission.  </p><p>  The current plan, post 2014, is that NATO will lead a follow on training advisory and assistance mission to support the development of Afghan National Security Forces capacity and provide sustained practical support for improving the country&rsquo;s capacity to tackle security threats. This plan has yet to be finalised. The question of Ireland contributing to any follow on mission in Afghanistan will be considered in the context of what other contributing countries are planning.  A key consideration in this regard will be the availability of adequate force protection assets and personnel to protect any such training elements.</p></reply>

Without under-estimating the political complexities that persist around the immigration reform discussion in the United States, I was encouraged to hear views from both Democrats and Republicans that there is now a growing consensus in favour of reform. I have instructed Ambassador Anderson and her team, working with the Irish American lobby groups who have already put in such a great effort, to continue their efforts to persuade members of Congress to seize this opportunity and make immigration reform a reality.</p></reply>

The aid programme is regarded internationally as one of the most effective in delivering results in the fight against poverty and hunger.  Our commitment to development cooperation is clear in the Programme for Government and has been strongly reiterated in our new policy for international development - <i>One World One Future.  </i>The policy sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world in which people are empowered to overcome poverty and hunger and to fully realise their rights and potential. Despite the very severe economic and budgetary situation we have faced, the Government has clearly demonstrated its determination since coming into office to maintain and stabilise the budget for Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the maximum possible extent.  In the three years 2011 through 2013, a total of over &euro;1.9 billion has been provided for ODA.  This is an enormous achievement in the circumstances.  For 2014, the Government has again managed to allocate almost &euro;600 million to ODA, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to helping the poor of the world.</p><p>  As with all major exchequer spending programmes, the annual budget for ODA is ultimately a matter for the Government and is announced by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on budget day.  Our new policy clearly states that the Government remains committed to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP in ODA, and to making further progress towards achieving it as soon as economic circumstances permit.</p></reply>

The government&rsquo;s Minsters are drawn from a number of different political groupings including the Svoboda party. The Taoiseach has written to Prime Minister Yatseniuk, offering his congratulations and I, for my part, have written in similar terms to interim Foreign Minister Deshchytsia. The Foreign Minister attended a meeting with EU Ministers immediately before the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 March at which Ireland was represented by the Minster of State for European Affairs, Paschal Donohoe T.D.</p><p>  The new government is confronted with the most extraordinary challenges as a consequence of the Russian Federation&rsquo;s flagrant violation of Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity leading to the illegal referendum on 16 March and the effective annexation of Crimea two days later.  Prime Minister Yatseniuk attended the meeting of EU Heads of State and Government in Brussels on 6 March and provided a comprehensive briefing to the Taoiseach and other leaders on the situation in his country.  He subsequently attended last week&rsquo;s European Council where he and EU leaders including the Taoiseach signed the political chapters of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. The signature is a demonstration of the EU&rsquo;s strong political support for, and solidarity with, the government and people of Ukraine. At the economic level, a major package of financial assistance to Kiev worth up to &euro;11 billion has been endorsed by the Heads of State and Government.  </p><p>  At his meetings with the EU Heads of State and Government in Brussels, as well as at his appearance before the UN Security Council on 13 March, the Prime Minister has been quite clear that he and his government wish to work towards an immediate de-escalation of tensions and to initiate contacts with the Russian Federation with a view to peacefully resolving the crisis through dialogue. Following its meeting on 20 March, the European Council adopted Conclusions underlining the Union&rsquo;s supports for the Ukrainian people and their right to choose their own future. The European Union encourages the government to ensure that the Presidential election on 25 May will be free and fair. The Union stands by the Ukrainian government in its efforts to stabilise the economy and undertake reforms. The Conclusions also commend the measured response shown so far by Ukraine.</p><p>  The EU has welcomed the Ukrainian government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring the representative nature and inclusiveness of governmental structures, reflecting regional diversity.  We also welcome the government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure the full protection of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities, to undertake constitutional reform, to investigate all human rights violations and acts of violence and to fight extremism. I look forward, in this connection, to the early establishment of the Council of Europe International Advisory Board and therefore welcome the visit of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Secretary General, Thorbj&oslash;rn Jagland to Kiev on 10 March where he had constructive talks with the interim government and civil society. </p></reply>

I have reiterated in this House on a regular basis that this Government is completely opposed to such practices, and that the use of our airspace or airports has not been permitted, and will not be permitted, for any illegal purpose, including rendition or the extrajudicial detention of any person. This is reflected in the current Programme for Government which states that this Government &ldquo;will enforce the prohibition of the use of Irish airports and related facilities for purposes not in line with the dictates of international law&rdquo;.</p><p>  If evidence exists that Irish airports are being used for any alleged unlawful purpose it should be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which would have responsibility for investigating such matters.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has statutory powers of search and entry available to it under various legislative provisions which may be exercised in circumstances where a member reasonably suspects that an offence has been or is being committed. Immediately following the first reports suggesting that the US was practising extraordinary rendition to transit prisoners, the then Government demanded and received specific assurances from the US authorities that such prisoners had not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission. These assurances were confirmed at the highest political level. They are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full control of the US Government. I am satisfied, as previous Ministers have been, that it is appropriate for the Government to rely fully on these assurances.</p></reply>

Minister White participated in the very successful St Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade held at Sokolniki Park in central Moscow on 15 March.  It is estimated that the parade was attended by 15,000 people.  Later that evening, he was a guest at the Irish Business Club&rsquo;s charity Emerald Ball which was very well attended by business figures, community representatives, cultural, media and other important contacts. As well as providing an opportunity to reach out to the Irish diaspora based in Moscow and further afield in Russia, the Minister&rsquo;s visit also had a strong business focus, involving attendance at the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day Embassy reception on 17 March, meetings with Irish business community representatives, two food promotion events, and a meeting with the Local Market Team comprised of the Embassy and the State agencies present in the market.  He also visited a Tourism Ireland outdoor photographic exhibition in central Moscow.  Approximately 20,000 Russians visited Ireland last year and it is encouraging to know that this figure is set to grow even further.  </p><p>  The ongoing crisis in Ukraine was discussed with the Minister in his meetings with Irish community and business representatives who expressed their concern about the deteriorating situation and the very serious implications for the EU-Russian relationship, politically and economically.  In his discussions, Minister White articulated Ireland&rsquo;s strong views on the crisis and our call for inclusive dialogue to begin as a matter of urgency to find a peaceful settlement.     </p><p>  During the visit, Minister White met the Deputy Minister responsible for Primary Healthcare and also with the Deputy Director of for the Russian Drugs Control Agency to discuss matters directly related to their respective portfolios.</p><p>  The Minister had a very useful and extensive meeting on 17 March with representatives of Amnesty International, the International Crisis Group and the Russian LGBT Sport Federation on issues of most concern to them.  As is widely recognised, civil society organisations are under intense pressure within the Russian Federation owing to increasingly restrictive legislation including the so-called NGO Foreign Agents Law about which the EU has expressed its grave concern on many occasions.  </p><p>  For my part, I have spoken out about this issue and have also raised my serious concerns over Russia&rsquo;s LGBTI-related legislation directly with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.   Minister White conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the work of these organisations and underlined our interest in staying in close contact with them.  I understand from talking with Minister White since he returned that the civil society representatives were highly appreciative of the support and solidarity which Ireland continues to show for them and their vitally important work within Russia. </p></reply>

This support is administered through the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) which provides direct assistance to Irish emigrants, both longstanding and new.  Since 2004, Irish groups ranging from those providing front line services to those most in need including the elderly, isolated, vulnerable and new arrivals, have received grants in the region of &euro;100 million, under the Programme. The ESP provided support to over 190 Irish community and business organisations in 17 countries in 2013 and despite the economic situation I ensured that the ESP budget for 2014 - &euro;11.595 million - remained at the same level as in 2012 and 2013.</p><p>  The programme provides extensive funding to organisations acting as first port of call for new emigrants in traditional emigration centres such as Britain and the U.S.A.  In addition to these traditional channels of support, funds are also provided to organisations supporting a wide range of business and graduate networks around the world.</p><p>  Irish based organisations that offer pre-departure services to Irish citizens considering emigration, such as the Crosscare Migrant Project, also receive ESP funding.  Crosscare provides training to mainstream service providers on emigration and returners&rsquo; issues whilst working in conjunction with Irish welfare organisations abroad (many of which are also funded by ESP) as well as both statutory and voluntary service providers in Ireland,  including the probation service, Salvation Army and Safehome Limited.</p><p>  A substantial portion of ESP funding is provided to a number of organisations primarily focussed on tackling the problem of homelessness.  These include, in the London area, the Cricklewood Homeless Concern, the Safe Start Foundation in Middlesex, the London Irish Centre, the Luton Irish Forum and the NOAH Enterprise (Luton), amongst others.</p></reply>

I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the recent statements in the D&aacute;il on this topic, in particular my own statement and that of my colleague Minister of State Costello, where we set out the Department&rsquo;s substantial progress to date under the Programme for Government commitments. </p><p> In terms of the crucial priority of economic recovery, we have achieved very significant progress in restoring Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation through a renewed emphasis on economic diplomacy. My Department and our Embassy network use every opportunity to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s economic strengths and potential to international audiences. The impact of this work is clear. We have regained access to international bond markets and the confidence of international investors. Export levels are now higher than they were before the economic crisis. Net job creation from inward investment and by our small and medium sized exporting companies was higher in 2013 than it has been for ten years. Ireland is now ranked by Forbes magazine as the best country in the world for business.</p><p>  We also committed to implement the recommendations in the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy and to actively develop cultural and diplomatic links with emerging markets. My Department has recently completed a short, focused review of the Strategy, adding an additional seven &lsquo;Exploratory and High Potential Markets&rsquo; and we recently announced that five new Embassies and three new Consulates General will be opened in key locations across South East Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. These Embassies and Consulates will provide a platform for further promotion of Irish exports, investment, tourism and education.  </p><p>  In relation to Northern Ireland, we continue to work intensively with the parties in the Executive and with the British Government in support of an early agreement in the context of the ongoing political talks on parades, flags and contending with the past.  British-Irish and North-South relations are strong and strengthening, offering  a new and unprecedented opportunity currently to accelerate North/South and East/West cooperation in a practical direction in support of job creation and economic growth on the island.  </p><p>  Ministers North and South agreed, at the North South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s Plenary meeting in November 2013 in the context of the St Andrews Agreement Review, to focus on new priorities for practical economic cooperation that can help economic recovery, job creation, the optimal use of public money and the most effective delivery of public services.  Both the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are keen to ensure that a preliminary package of new priorities will be ready for consideration at the next NSMC Plenary meeting in summer 2014.</p><p>  Despite the very severe economic and budgetary situation we have faced, the Government has clearly demonstrated its determination since coming into office to maintain and stabilise the budget for Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the maximum possible extent.  In the three years 2011 through 2013, a total of over &euro;1.9 billion has been provided for ODA.  This is an enormous achievement in the circumstances.  For 2014, the Government has again managed to allocate almost &euro;600 million to ODA, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to helping the poor of the world.  Our new policy clearly states that the Government remains committed to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP in ODA, and to making further progress towards achieving it as soon as economic circumstances permit.</p></reply>

While Council discussions were, understandably, dominated by the situation in Ukraine which I address below, other important issues were also discussed, and Conclusions were agreed across a number of key policy areas; the full text of these Conclusions may be accessed on the official EU website  . </p><p>  In opening remarks, High Representative (HR) Ashton briefed Ministers on her recent visits to both Bosnia and Iran. HR Ashton also presented a short overview of the Middle<b></b>East Peace Process (MEPP) and then moved on to update the Council on the latest developments in the Syrian<b></b>  crisis. It is anticipated that more in-depth discussions will take place on the Southern and Eastern Neighbourhood regions at the April Council meeting. A short discussion on the situation in the Central African Republic took place, where the emphasis was on the need to speed up work on the preparations for the CSDP EUFOR CAR operation, as laid down in UN Security Council Resolution 2134.  The FAC was also briefed on the preparations currently advancing for the EU-Africa Summit in Brussels at the beginning of next month (2-3 April). The final agenda item, energy, was addressed over lunch and Ministers were joined by Commissioner Oettinger for an exchange of views on EU energy policy and, more specifically, the foreign policy dimension to this critical dossier.</p><p>  Turning to the crisis in Ukraine, the FAC had a comprehensive and wide-ranging discussion, agreeing on Council Conclusions which strongly condemn the holding of the illegal referendum in Crimea, stating that this is in clear breach of the Ukrainian Constitution. The FAC confirmed that the EU will not recognise the illegal referendum and its outcome, noting that it was held in the visible presence of armed soldiers under conditions of intimidation of civic activists and journalists. The Council Conclusions commend the measured response shown so far by Ukraine.</p><p>  All Member States expressed strong views and deep concern about the unfolding crisis. In light of the deterioration in the situation, it was decided to implement measures envisaged by the Heads of State and Government at their informal meeting on 6 March, namely the imposition of travel restrictions and an asset freeze against 21 individuals, 8 from the pro-Russian Crimean authorities, 10 Russian Parliamentarians, and 3 Russian military figures.  As the Deputy is aware, the European Council at its meeting of 20-21 March added a further 12 names to the list.</p><p>  In relation to assistance - political and economic - for the government in Kiev, the FAC supported the signing of the political chapters of the Ukraine Association Agreement (which took place at the European Council last Friday). The European Union is also committed to providing strong financial support to Ukraine&rsquo;s economic and financial stabilisation, as presented by the European Commission in its assistance package.</p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council encouraged the Ukrainian authorities to implement an inclusive process, to pursue their efforts to ensure free and fair elections and to advance constitutional reform.  It stressed that all human rights violations and acts of violence need to be properly investigated and that measures need to be stepped up to combat impunity. In this context, Ireland and its EU partners look forward to the early establishment of the Council of Europe International Advisory Panel.</p><p>  The FAC confirmed that the EU remains ready to support the facilitating of dialogue between Ukraine and Russia and urged Moscow to take steps to de-escalate the crisis, immediately withdraw its forces back to their pre-crisis numbers and garrisons in line with its international commitments. Importantly, the Conclusions noted that there was still time to reverse current developments and that the Union is ready for a constructive dialogue with all sides. </p><p>The Foreign Affairs Council was preceded by a meeting of the Friends of Ukraine which was attended by Minister Donohoe. EU Ministers were able to discuss latest developments with Ukraine&rsquo;s Foreign Minister, Andrii Deshchytsia, who was also in attendance.   </p></reply>

As the number of fatalities reaches an estimated 140,000   people, there are now over 9 million people within Syria who are in need of immediate life-saving support, with a further 2.5 million Syrian refugees requiring assistance in neighbouring countries. </p><p>  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, I announced a pledge of a further &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance in 2014 at the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and the region in Kuwait on January 15th 2014. This additional pledge brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall funding commitment over the period 2011 to 2014 to &euro;26.011 million, of which &euro;19 million has been disbursed to date.   Funds have been provided to a range of established UN partners as well as to Irish NGOs. </p><p>  Ireland has been consistent in its efforts to ensure that the necessary attention is given by the international community to this crisis, including at the at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels last week where discussions were focussed, in particular, on the humanitarian consequences of the conflict, both within Syria and in its neighbouring countries. Ireland has consistently matched our material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis,   and to advocate for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access. We have called for all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from the targeting of civilians. Ireland will continue to advocate at all relevant international fora for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort, as well as for the full and immediate implementation by all parties to the conflict of UN Security Council Resolution 2139 on humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people.</p></reply>

It is estimated that the Typhoon affected more than 14 million people, with almost 4 million remaining displaced, including some 1.5 million children.  Over 6,000 lives have been lost to date and almost 1800 people are still missing.   Ireland was among the first to respond to this disaster, providing immediate, life-saving assistance. Our contribution to date stands at over &euro;4.1 million making us one of the most generous contributors to this relief effort on a per capita basis.</p><p>  I have just returned from a visit to the island of Leyte in the Philippines where I saw at firsthand the devastation caused by the typhoon. An enormous amount has been achieved over the past four months, including through Irish-funded programmes, some of which I visited during my two day visit to the island. However millions of people still require urgent assistance to rebuild their lives and livelihoods and during my visit I pledged a further &euro;3 million in funding to demonstrate   Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the Philippines over the longer term, particularly as international attention has shifted elsewhere.</p><p>  This contribution will bring Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to the Typhoon response to more than &euro;7 million. The funding will help to ensure that affected communities can rebuild their livelihoods and strengthen their resilience to prepare for any future natural disasters in the region. </p><p>   Over &euro;2.6million of our funding has been provided through our key NGO partners.  It is being used for the provision of emergency food and non-food items; water, sanitation and hygiene; emergency health care and the protection of vulnerable women and children.  It is benefitting up to 50,000 households. </p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has also authorised a contribution of &euro;500,000 to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) to support its work to restore the livelihoods of farmers affected by<i></i>the Typhoon.</p><p>  To date, Ireland has authorised four airlifts of essential relief items from our emergency pre-positioned stocks.  The total amount of essential relief items provided by Ireland is 166 tonnes, valued at &euro;967,000. According to the latest figures, Ireland is the second largest contributor of emergency stocks through the UN World Food Programme Humanitarian Response Depot system. In addition, we deployed five members of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps to the Philippines to assist UN relief teams.</p></reply>

However, the following general information may be useful.</p><p>  For Local Property Tax (LPT) purposes a residential property is defined as any building or structure (or part of a building) which is used as, or is suitable for use as, a dwelling. If a residential property is suitable for use as a dwelling but is unoccupied, it is still liable to LPT based on the valuation of the property. However, if the property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, it is not liable for LPT.</p><p>  LPT is a self-assessed tax.  I am advised that if a property owner considers that her or his property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, s/he should notify the Revenue Commissioners without delay and arrange to provide relevant supporting documentation   for example, photographic evidence, or a report from a suitably qualified person such as a surveyor or an engineer. Based on the information provided by the property owner, Revenue will consider the claim and make a decision on the matter.</p><p>  Each case will be considered on its merits and it is therefore not possible to provide a prescriptive list of criteria that would need to be met for a property to be deemed unsuitable for use as a dwelling. However, a property owner should consider whether the property is habitable by reference to the structure of the building; including whether the property has a roof, windows and doors, sanitary facilities, and services.  Water or electricity supply turned off or temporarily disconnected would not necessarily mean that a residential property is uninhabitable.</p><p>  In the context of Question [13734], the fact that a residential property is the subject of a dispute in the High Court between the owner and the builder would not remove the obligation on the owner to pay LPT.</p><p>  Finally, a property that was not liable to LPT on 1 May 2013 on the basis that it was unsuitable for use as a dwelling will not be liable to LPT for the years 2013 to 2016.  If such a property were to be refurbished to make it suitable for use as a dwelling by 1 November 2016 then it will be liable to LPT for 2017 and subsequent years.</p></reply>

The current indications are that in excess of 400,000 properties are still due to pay arrears of HHC. However this number may reduce as the data matching exercise concludes.</p><p>  - Finally, Revenue has informed me that where liable persons pay their arrears of HHC on or before 31 March 2014, they will be considered compliant and will not face any further charges. However, where any arrears of HHC remains outstanding after that date, then interest will be charged at 0.0219% per day and will apply from 1 July 2013 to the date of payment. </p></reply>

However they can claim an exemption from income tax and USC, provided:</p><p>  - the gross amount of childcare income does not exceed &euro;15,000 in the year,</p><p>  - they are minding not more than 3 children, and</p><p>  - the children are looked after in the home of the childminder.</p><p>  They must also notify the relevant childcare authorities each year that they are providing childcare services in their home.</p><p>  While the childcare income is exempt from income tax and USC, PRSI is chargeable. However PRSI does not apply where:</p><p>  - the provider of the childcare is over 66 years of age; or</p><p>  - the provider is under 66 and the person's only income source is childcare income which is less than &euro;5,000 per annum.</p><p>   Therefore, in the case of grandparents providing the childcare, once they are over 66 and meet the conditions of the exemption, they will have no liability to tax, USC or PRSI.</p><p>  For those individuals under 66 and earning over &euro;5,000, it is in their interest to claim the childcare exemption. By making the exemption claim and returning the income they are ensuring that their liability is to PRSI only and  the payment of the PRSI will go towards maintaining their entitlement to the following Department of Social Protection benefits:</p><p>  - State Pension (Contributory)</p><p>  - Widow's and Widower's (Contributory) Pension</p><p>  - Guardian's Payment (Contributory)</p><p>  - Maternity Benefit</p><p>  - Adoptive Benefit.</p><p>   Regarding the process of making the claim for exemption, I am advised that, again it has been incorrectly reported that a person must complete a 26-page form in order to get the exemption.  This is not the case and the exemption can be easily claimed on the Form 11S, which is a short, six-page form, or by going online and claiming.</p><p>  It is most unfortunate that the incorrect reporting of what was essentially a notification to people to remind them to claim an exemption from tax and USC has caused confusion in the minds of taxpayers but I am happy to correct the record and clarify matters. </p></reply>

Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.  In certain cases, such couples also need to maintain two households due to the location of employment, for example. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of the parents to look after a child, including financially.  The new credit is targeted to assist principal child carers to take up, or remain in employment.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, a primary carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.  A secondary carer may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year. In this manner, it is possible for both carers to claim the credit in alternate years, provided that all of the qualifying conditions are met.</p><p>  It should be noted that where a primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one). In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer. In addition, a secondary carer who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one) regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.</p><p>  This measure was only approved by the Oireachtas and enacted in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 in late December. To amend the legislation in the manner suggested by the Deputy would not take account of all of the potential caring scenarios that exist for the relevant children.</p></reply>

Where a regulated financial institution outsources part, or all, of their mortgage book, the same protections apply to borrowers and the institutions have responsibility for ensuring that these protections are applied by the outsourced company.

The targets cover both proposed and concluded sustainable solutions with respect to the lenders principal dwelling homes (PDH) and buy-to-let (BTL) mortgagees.  Under this rolling process, quarterly performance targets have been set to the end of June 2014 to require the banks to propose and put in place durable long term solutions to address individual cases of mortgage arrears of more than 90 days in arrears.</p><p>  The Central Bank has indicated that all six mortgage lenders covered by the MART process have reported that they met the 20% proposed sustainable solutions target for the second quarter of 2013 and also the 30% target for the third quarter in 2013.  In particular, with respect to the third quarter 2013 target, which is the latest available data, the lenders have reported to the Central Bank they had issued proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears (PDH and BTL) against the 30% target.</p><p>  The Central Bank's 'Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossession Statistics' published earlier this month, shows that at end-December 2013 there were 145,530 residential mortgage accounts for buy-to-let properties held in the State. Of this total stock of accounts, 30,706, or 21.1 per cent, were in arrears of more than 90 days, reflecting a decrease of 1.5 per cent over the quarter.</p><p>  In addition, the monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department will also provide an impetus for those MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.  The latest publication, in respect of the end of January, shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.  For example, the number of permanent restructures of buy-to-let mortgages more than 90 days in arrears has risen from around 5,600 in December to around 5,800 in January 2014.  The data published by my Department and the Central Bank would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in arrears and putting in place appropriate measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.</p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality has informed me that there was, as expected, a marked increase in the number of Civil Bills lodged in the courts following the passing of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013.  However the Courts Service has indicated that the situation has since stabilised and that, to date, there has been no significant change in the numbers of Civil Bills lodged.  It is however important to point out that the issuing of a Civil Bill does not automatically lead to a repossession, for example a borrower who has not been engaging with his lender may re-engage following the issuing of a Civil Bill and this may lead to an alternative outcome.</p><p>  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the Central Bank's mortgage arrears and restructures statistics and my Department's monthly mortgage data publications show that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures are being put in place.  However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this.</p></reply>

The facts around this have been confirmed by the management team.   The proposed receiver advised that, if appointed by NAMA, he would be legally obliged to consider the new bid, since he has a statutory obligation to secure the best price reasonably obtainable for the secured assets at the time of their sale. Media reporting of the emergence of this further bid caused concern among suppliers and trade creditors, which the Directors of Staunton Sports brought to NAMA s attention.  Having regard to the deteriorating condition of the business and the company s insolvent position, and based on legal advice, NAMA and the Directors of Staunton Sports decided that Examinership was an alternative option, which would permit all bids to be considered while the Company was under the protection of the High Court.  NAMA is funding the company during the Examinership process, which includes funding the payment of suppliers and staff wages.</p><p>  I note the statement from the Directors of the company, which acknowledges the support of NAMA in the current Examinership process and states the Board s confidence that the current process will deliver best results for all the stakeholders.</p></reply>

This will place them in a better position to absorb the impact of the Tracker mortgages.</p><p>  Furthermore, as recent capital market transactions have demonstrated the Irish banks have been able to access both secured and unsecured funding at competitive rates across a range of maturities. In addition, the deposit base has stabilised resulting in reduced reliance on central bank funding. Taken together this has helped to reduce the impact of the negative carry associated with tracker mortgages.</p><p>   The deputy will also be aware that in recent times the Banks have pursued self-help measures to address this issue by introducing innovative solutions such as offering negative equity type mortgages and allowing borrowers to retain tracker facilities when moving house for a fixed period. These initiatives together with the recovery in the property market and an associated rise in housing transactions will also help to alleviate the issue.</p></reply>

Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, one of the commitments contained in the &quot;Access to Finance&quot; chapter of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 is to undertake a survey of the demand for SME credit in Q2 and Q4 2014. My Department has commissioned biannual independent reports on the demand for credit by SMEs since 2011. These are the most comprehensive surveys of SME credit demand in Ireland and cover over 1,500 respondents. The next survey will cover the period October 2013 - March 2014 and is due for publication in May.  I will not be bringing forward the survey as it is important to ensure consistency in terms of the periods in which the surveys take place.</p><p>  As regards the issue of SME debt it should be noted in the first instance that the Central Bank does not publish figures on arrears or non-performing loans specific to the SME Sector.  In June 2013 the Central Bank did set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term forbearance solutions.  The targets set reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.  The Central Bank has informed the officials in my Department that the banks have reported that they have met their required targets to date.  This perspective has been reaffirmed by both the IMF and the European Commission who report that the<b></b>workout of SME arrears is progressing and that imposed targets are being met.  <b>  </b></p><p>  Recently published results from the covered Irish banks indicate that both banks are well advanced in restructuring their SME loan books.  Bank of Ireland's most recent  published results indicate that they had reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases.  Similarly the AIB's results indicate a resolution level of approximately 65%.  It is also worth noting that defaulted loans for both banks have reduced year-on-year.  </p><p>  The Central Bank's process of assessing financial institutions in their efforts to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer term sustainable solutions is an important element in assisting SMEs to potentially transition from a distressed to a more sustainable state and will continue in 2014. Additionally, the Government's decision to fast track legislation to allow small companies (as defined by the Companies Acts) to apply to the Circuit Court for examinership and the on going work of the Credit Review Office, which has been given an expanded remit, are all initiatives that will assist viable SMEs in adressing their debt situation. I should stress that the credit review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by AIB or Bank of Ireland as well as when credit is refused by them. I would strongly advise any SME whose credit is reduced or withdrawn to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.</p><p>  The remarks by the UCD academic Morgan Kelly relate to the forthcoming stress testing by the ECB and in this context the Governor of the Central Bank indicated recently that the purpose of the forthcoming ECB stress tests on 128 European banks, which includes Irish banks, was to remove market and government doubts about the ability of banks to absorb losses with their own shareholders funds.  I would again suggest that Professor Kelly would liaise with the Central Bank and share his analysis and findings in relation to his expectations on the potential impact that the forthcoming stress tests may have on the domestic SME sector.</p></reply>

The intention is to ensure that the funding provided through this initiative will provide viable SMEs in Ireland with access to a long-term and appropriately-priced supply of finance in a manner that supports productive investment, encourages growth and increases employment in the SME sector, including where the market appetite remains constrained.  In this regard, the KfW project would have the dual and complementary roles of providing funding to SMEs in general and also targeting investment in a manner that supports key strategic sectors and alleviates financing constraints.  </p></reply>

The guide will be available on the new Local Enterprise Office website when that goes live.  Government officials are currently showcasing the online guide in test mode with small businesses at a series of &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot; roadshows in Limerick, Galway and Cork.</p></reply>

It remains the position that some staff may, in time, be re-hired by NAMA, its service providers or other purchasers of the IBRC assets as the sale processes are completed.</p><p>  In relation to the improved redundancy terms being sought I am advised by the Special Liquidators that the voluntary severance scheme, that was in place prior to liquidation, is no longer operational and that IBRC employee contracts were terminated in the Republic of Ireland in February 2013 on the appointment of the Special Liquidators. As a result of the termination of the employment contracts, employees were entitled to apply for a statutory redundancy payment and a statutory notice payment, subject to the limits prescribed by statute.</p><p>  While my officials will continue to engage on this matter, I am not in a position to interfere directly. There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules. Such interference could have the impact of diverting the assets of IBRC from one category of creditor to another outside the normal Companies Acts priorities. Any such interference would be open to challenges in the Irish Courts by unsecured creditors.</p></reply>

This was the period during which house prices peaked.</p><p>  A mortgage holder qualifies for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period. In addition, the increased rate of tax relief for first-time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year. </p><p>  A lower rate of relief is provided for non-first time buyers in view of the fact that such individuals would have already received the first-time buyers rate of relief for the first seven years on their qualifying home loans and that the proportion of interest on their subsequent repayments would be significantly lower. Those individuals trading up or down in the period 2004 to 2008, would also be likely to have an element of capital to utilise towards the purchase of their second or subsequent dwelling, which should have led to a reduced borrowing requirement on the relevant property.</p><p>  Given that mortgage interest relief has now been abolished for mortgages taken our since 1 January 2013, I do not propose to revisit the legislation with a view to introducing further changes.</p></reply>

The main deductible expenses are:</p><p>  -  any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>  -  the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>  -  the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p><p>  -  the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and</p><p>  -  payment of local authority rates.</p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.</p><p>  Where the aggregate of deductible expenses in any year exceed the gross rental income, the amount of the deficit is set against rental profits of the same year from other property. Where there are no other rental profits in the same year, the deficit is carried forward as a rental loss for offset against rental profits in future years. </p><p>  The 75% restriction on interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair residential property was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances. </p></reply>

Agreement as to who will be the principal carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians. </p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, a principal carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.  A secondary carer may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year.</p><p>  It should be noted that where a primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one), on the basis that the relevant child is not, in the main, being cared for by a single person. In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer. In addition, a secondary carer who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one) regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.</p></reply>

Under this scheme, qualifying road transport operators are entitled to claim a rebate of part of the duty paid on auto diesel used by them in qualifying road vehicles. The value of the rebate for the quarter ended 31 December 2013 is 6.2 cent per litre.</p><p>  The Deputy queries whether the rebate scheme should be extended to diesel used by agricultural contractors in agricultural machinery designed for off-road work.

Bailiwick broadly equates geographically with &quot;county&quot;. </p><p>  It should be noted that the amount of tax attributed to a county may not necessarily be an indication of economic activity in that county for several reasons. The liability of a trader to VAT is generally dealt with by reference to the location of the trader's registered office, even though the economic activity may be carried on in another county. An employer's liability for PAYE is normally attributed to the county in which wages and salaries are paid, even though the employees may live or work in different counties. Companies are associated on the tax record with the address of the head-office or branch with which contact is established for tax purposes, which may be different to the locations of other branches. The distribution of the taxes in question can also vary from year to year as businesses move premises.</p><p>  Revenue data on net receipts for most taxes can be linked to bailiwicks to provide an estimated breakdown of receipts on a county basis. The information for County Kerry for the years from 2006 to 2012, the latest year available, is shown in the following table.<table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>PAYE Income Tax (&euro;m)</b></th><th><b>Other Income Tax (&euro;m)</b></th><th><b>VAT (&euro;m)</b></th><th><b>Corporation Tax (&euro;m)</b></th></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>324.7</td><td>80.8</td><td>173.6</td><td>38.7</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>343.3</td><td>61.9</td><td>132.4</td><td>21.6</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>324.2</td><td>58.6</td><td>133.1</td><td>18.8</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>417.5</td><td>63.9</td><td>108.8</td><td>32.0</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>443.5</td><td>73.7</td><td>102.7</td><td>29.0</td></tr></table></p><p>  In considering the figures in the table, the following should be noted:</p><p>  The figures for VAT receipts include only VAT internal (VAT on imports and VAT on products leaving tax warehouses are excluded).</p><p>  PAYE Income Tax includes associated USC and Income Levy (for the relevant years).</p><p>  1.

In light of this I introduced several measures to help increase the supply of suitable residential housing stock as part of Budget 2014. These included   subject to State Aid approval   the extension of the Living City Initiative, to include Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin and the broadening of eligibility criteria to include all buildings built prior to 1915</p><p>  More generally, as outlined in the Medium-Term Economic Strategy, the Government will continue to work on addressing remaining challenges in the property and construction sectors. This will include developing an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing further improvements in the planning process to facilitate appropriate development, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision.</p></reply>

This comprised &euro;2.5bn in expenditure cuts and tax increases complemented with additional resources / other savings of &euro;0.6bn.</p><p>  These additional resources / other savings are made up of a number of items. Firstly, the NTMA Budget debt service estimate for 2014 is lower than the corresponding April SPU estimate, of the order &euro;0.2bn, due to an improvement in the interest rate environment generally and lower than previously planned bond issuance. In summer 2013, the Central Bank provided an estimate of the 2013 surplus income to be paid to the Central Fund in 2014 based on results to that date and projections for the remainder of the year.  The Central Bank revised this estimate upwards by &euro;0.1bn in September, in light of actual results for the first nine months and the consequent revisions of projections for the remaining three months of 2013.  In terms of savings from the Live Register, the numbers in work rose by 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013 and the Live Register at the end of quarter 3 2013 was down by just over 20,000 when compared to the same period in 2012. On foot of the recovering labour market, live register savings had exceeded those previously expected of the order of &euro;0.15bn.  Finally, the remaining &euro;0.15bn arises from a number of other factors mainly connected with State asset transactions.</p><p>  With Exchequer data available for only two months of the year, it is too early for a meaningful comparison against outturn for any estimates made as part of the Budget 2014 fiscal forecast. The estimates for additional resources / other savings in 2014 will be reviewed, closer to budget time, as part of the formulation of an overall Budget 2015 package of measures. </p></reply>

Agreement as to who will be the principal carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians.</p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.</p><p>  This measure was discussed at length during the passage through the Oireachtas of the recent Finance Bill, at which I brought forward an amendment to allow the credit to be relinquished by a principal carer such that a secondary claimant can avail of it provided they meet certain qualifying conditions. The Government, by allowing for such relinquishing, where a principal carer chooses to do so for whatever reason, actually provided for an additional option for single person carers, over and above that recommended by the Commission on Taxation. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 was signed into law by the President as recently as 18 December 2013. Therefore, I have no plans to review the matter in the short term.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the total guarantees include a &quot;double count&quot; of &euro;11.715 bn, as this risk is effectively covered both by the NAMA senior bond guarantee and by the guarantee to National Asset Resolution Limited. </p><p>   The Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) provides that all eligible deposits, up to a limit of &euro;100,000 per depositor per credit institution, are guaranteed to be repaid by the DGS. The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the operation of the DGS, which covers licensed credit institutions operating in the State.

Section 8(2) of this Act provides that any amounts payable from the Central Fund to the Central Bank for such purposes shall be repaid to the Central Fund from the deposit protection account. </p><p>  As outlined above, the deposit protection account is funded by the credit institutions that are covered by the DGS.

It is split between general government and the public corporations. </p><p>  -  General government in Ireland consists of the Exchequer, Government departments and offices, Local Authorities, and all public entities that are mainly financed by those bodies. General government debt is the consolidated debt of this sector. </p><p>  -  The public corporations sector in Ireland consists of such bodies as the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and CI&Eacute; in the non-financial corporations sector; and AIB and IL&amp;amp;P in the financial corporations sector; the Central Bank is also part of the public sector. The debts of these entities and other public corporations are not part of general government debt and are thus considered 'off-balance sheet'.</p><p>A register of public bodies is maintained by the CSO and is available at </p><p>  The CSO currently compile estimates of the liabilities of public corporations for transmission to Eurostat on a confidential basis, however from end 2014 these data will also be published nationally.  The current estimate for the total stock of liabilities of public corporations end-2012 amounts to 216% of GDP. Of this amount, 120% is debt of financial corporations and 82% is debt of the Central Bank.</p><p>  Notes </p><p>  1. The percentages above represent the liabilities of public corporations. A measure of net debt of public corporations is not currently available. In the case of financial corporations and the Central Bank, the liabilities are largely matched by assets in the same asset classes that are used by the CSO to compute net debt.</p><p>  2. It is worth adding that the NAMA SPV is classified in the financial corporations sector in the national accounts. That is to say that the NAMA SPV is a private corporation and therefore its liabilities are not be included in the debts of public corporations. The liabilities of NAMA are, however, fully guaranteed by government and are therefore included in statement 1.11 of the Finance Accounts where it is shown for 2012 that NAMA held debt amounting to 16% of GDP. 3. The EU-wide definition of debt does not include pension liabilities of general government. An estimate of the pension liability of government of &euro;116bn is given in the CSO Government Finance Statistics publication. This figure is based on a 2009 estimate by the C&amp;amp;AG which is currently being updated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-25a.346.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032500059#WRG01400"><p>As indicated in the Government s policy document  One World, One Future    Ireland s Policy for International Development published in May of 2013, the potential benefits of membership of the African Development Bank are under on-going consideration.  Ireland is currently a member of several Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Council of Europe Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Ireland considers MDBs to be an effective channel through which to distribute aid because contributions to the MDB can be aggregated with other countries contributions and be spread across a wider number of regions and thematic areas than would be possible through a bilateral aid programme. In this way, the multilateral channel is an efficient and effective complement to Ireland s international aid programme which focuses selectively on key partner countries and priority areas.    As the Deputy may be aware, Africa has been the main focus of Ireland s aid programme for many years and eight of Ireland s nine partner countries are in Africa.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is conscious of the importance of seeking new sources of growth opportunities for Irish business and this has been a priority of this Government since it entered office.  Joining an MDB enables companies from that country to tender for contracts for development projects, however it should be noted that there is not an automatic entitlement or a minimum country allocation for the awarding of contracts. Instead, the focus of the MDB when awarding is on quality and competitiveness, and each tender is evaluated on its own merits. </p><p>  Joining an MDB is a long-term decision and involves the consideration of many factors such as the strategic fit between the MDB and the country s own development priorities, complementarity with the country s bilateral aid programme and the performance of the MDB and its impact on development issues. Therefore, there are wider considerations than procurement and business opportunities. In addition, I would like to remind the Deputy that Ireland s aid is 100% untied and there is great pride in not mixing development priorities and business opportunities by tying our aid contributions.   Another important factor in considering MDB membership is the financial implication for a country, arising from the initial capital requirement and the regular contributions thereafter. As a result of the tight fiscal and budgetary constraints of recent years, Ireland was unfortunately not in a position to consider joining additional MDBs. </p><p>  I can advise the Deputy that a review of Ireland s MDB membership is in progress. Discussions have been on-going between officials in my Department and colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding potentially joining the African Development Bank. These discussions are in the early stage, with options currently being explored, and this matter will continue to receive careful consideration in the months ahead.   Ireland s development policy takes a whole-of Government approach and as such, decisions relating to MDB membership will be taken on that basis and only when all options have been considered and all relevant stakeholders have been consulted.</p><p>  I would refer the Deputy to Ireland s Africa Strategy which was launched in 2011. This sets out an overarching framework for Ireland s development and trade strategy for Africa. As part of the Africa Strategy, support will be provided this year to assist Irish companies in bidding for contracts tendered under the European Development Fund, of which Ireland is a member, for the Africa region.</p></reply>

Where total gains in any year do not exceed &euro;1,270 they are not chargeable to CGT.</p><p>  With regard to the transfer of single farm payment entitlements for VAT purposes, where a payment entitlement is sold without land then VAT is due at the standard rate on the sale if the sale proceeds exceed the relevant threshold for VAT registration (currently &euro;37,500). However, where a payment entitlement and land are sold together to a person who intends to carry on the farming business, then the sale may be treated as the transfer of a business and not subject to VAT. There may be other less significant tax implications in certain instances.</p><p>  As the Deputy has noted, officials in my Department are considering this issue with officials from the Department Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, I have no plans at this time to alter the tax treatment referred to above. </p></reply>

Thus, for example, the person who is the liable person on 1 November 2013 is responsible for the payment of LPT for the year 2014. </p><p>  In general, the owner of a residential property is the  liable person  and continues to be so notwithstanding the appointment of a receiver. However, where a financial institution enforces its security over a property by taking possession of the property, the financial institution, as a  mortgagee in possession , displaces the owner of the property as the liable person. </p><p>  While a receiver is not a  liable person  under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), it can happen that he or she may assume responsibility for payment of LPT. However, such responsibility does not come within the scope of the LPT Act.  It is not possible to give a definitive answer about the circumstances in which this might happen as it will depend on the terms of the particular mortgage deed between the property owner and the financial institution, the terms under which the receiver is appointed and whether, depending on when the mortgage deed was created, it is governed by the Conveyancing Act 1881 or the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.  </p></reply>

Where, in the Bank's opinion, the state of the Fund is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State. Funds from the levy are collected from insurers by the Revenue Commissioners and these funds are transferred on a monthly basis to the ICF. <b></b>  The funds from the levy have been used to allow the Quinn Insurance Limited administrators to meet the financial obligations of the administration of QIL as they arise.</p><p>  The 3% stamp duty on non-life insurance premiums was introduced in 1982 and is often referred to as an insurance levy.  This Stamp Duty forms a part of general stamp duty receipts and is paid into the Central Fund along with other tax receipts.  </p><p>  No decision has been made to introduce a flood levy on insurance premiums.  As the Deputy is aware, Government policy in relation to flooding aims to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible. The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences as well as a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme. Because of cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, this approach will see benefits over the medium and long term.</p><p>  The OPW and Insurance Ireland yesterday agreed on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes. The outcome of this arrangement is that the insurance industry will have a much greater understanding of the extent of the protection provided by flood defence works and will therefore be able to reflect this in the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed.</p><p>  My Department is also undertaking a review of measures to address the availability of flood insurance cover, including the experience and proposals in other countries. In assessing these, care has to be taken that the proposed solutions do not put in place arrangements which, over time, would weaken the provision of insurance cover by the market with possible negative long-term consequences for the economy.  </p></reply>

This is increased to &euro;3,300 for jointly assessed married couples or civil partners and &euro;2,190 for a widowed person or surviving civil partner (without dependant children).</p><p>  Further tax credits may be claimed where the qualifying criteria are satisfied. Some examples of the types of credits that may be applicable include:-</p><p>  -  PAYE credit of &euro;1,650 which is granted to employees and pensioners;</p><p>  -  Single Person Child Carer Credit of &euro;1,650, granted where a qualifying  child resides with the claimant for the whole or greater part of the year;</p><p>  -  Age credit of &euro;245 granted where the taxpayer is aged 65 years or over in the year of assessment.  This is increased to &euro;490 for married couples or civil partners;</p><p>  -  Home Carer Credit of up to &euro;810 can be claimed by a spouse or civil partner who works at home caring for a child or children, or an aged or incapacitated individual. This credit is reduced if the home carer has income between &euro;5,080 and &euro;6,700;</p><p>  -  Health expenses relief can be claimed for qualifying expenses incurred in the provision of health care.  Relief is available at standard rate of 20% for all expenses other than maintenance or treatment in a nursing home which may relieved at the individual s marginal rate of tax. Information in relation to the taxation of individuals, and all tax credits, deductions and reliefs that may be applicable in individual circumstances is available on the Revenue website at <font color="#0000FF">.</font></p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support. The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. The NCSE has invited schools to make applications for SNA support for the coming 2014/15 school year by 26th March, 2014. </p><p>  All schools who wish to make applications to the NCSE for SNA support for children who have assessed care needs, should now submit such applications to the NCSE for their consideration. Details of the NCSE application criteria are available at www.ncse.ie. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements for the coming school year 2014/15 are set out in Circular 0007/2014 which is available on the website.</p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less. The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012. The final phase of the budget measure takes effect from September 2014. </p><p>  An appeals process is available to small schools which have had their staff number reduced as a result of the budget measure. A school with four classroom teachers or less which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional teacher as a result of the Budget 2012 measure can submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2014 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.</p><p>  The schools referred to by the Deputies submitted an appeal to the February, 2014 meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. Having considered the schools' applications in the context of the published grounds, the Board deemed the applications ineligible. The schools were notified accordingly. The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

Consequently, the feasibility of allowing a more frequent payment option would have to be considered in light of the size of the integrated school transport network.</p><p>  It makes sense that such an arrangement would significantly increase the administration costs involved given the significant increase in the number of invoices, payments and tickets that would need to be processed over the course of a school year.</p><p>  In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann advise that more frequent ticketing would mean that services would have to be checked more regularly to ensure that several thousand children are travelling with valid tickets, demanding potentially greater supervision and follow-up activity from an administrative perspective, with added cost implications. The current arrangements ensure that school transport services are utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.</p></reply>

Unlike most other areas of the public service teaching vacancies are being filled in accordance with the published criteria.  Normally, the staffing of schools is determined by the enrolments of the previous September.  However, the staffing arrangements also include provision for schools that are projecting significant increases in their enrolments for the start of the school year to be allocated additional classroom teachers.  The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published in January, 2014.</p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less.  The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012.

Educational quality for the pupils has to be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  It is also necessary to consider the needs of local communities and of course there are wider social and cultural factors that need to be considered.  Given our population growth, we have increasing enrolment at all levels of education which is expected to continue in the medium term.  Many pupil places are required in areas that currently have no school provision at all and we have schools in areas of stable or declining population with relatively low pupil numbers.</p><p>  Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by my Department in a value for money review which I am considering in consultation with my Government colleagues.  My intention is to publish the report of the review on completion of this consideration process.  It is expected that the report of the review process will provide a valuable evidence base which will help inform future policy direction in the area of small primary schools.</p></reply>

Following on from that announcement, prospective patron bodies were invited to apply for patronage of the schools under new arrangements for determining patronage for the schools.  These arrangements, which are overseen by the New Schools Establishment Group, place a heavy focus on parental choice and allow for the introduction or widening of diversity of school provision where parents want this.  Under this process, there was sufficient viable parental demand for Educate Together patronage for the proposed new schools on the north side of Dublin in Blanchardstown West and Balbriggan.  These school are opening in 2014 and 2016 respectively.</p><p>  My Department continues to analyse demographic data to identify where further new primary and post-primary schools may be required from 2016 onwards.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-25a.460.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032500061#WRJ01900"><p>This question raises two matters and I will deal with each in turn.  Firstly, Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are paid on the SNA salary scale which is set by the Minister for Education and Skills in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.  I should point out that this divisor was agreed with both of the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.</p><p>  Secondly, the question deals with the working hours of SNAs.  The contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (IMPACT and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005.  Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary)  Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15/05 (Primary) .</p><p>  This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs.  These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time.  The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in these standard SNA contracts of employment.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.  </p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.</p><p>  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement).  The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS</p><p>Hours </p><p>  Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant.  Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited.  Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.

The 5 year School Construction Plan announced in March 2012, provides for a &euro;2 billion school capital investment programme to 2016, of which &euro;1.5 billion is being allocated to fund major school projects with the balance needed for the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement initiative, the acquisition of sites and other works.  The Five Year Plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant demographic changes have been identified.</p><p>  Further to the Five Year Plan, my Department is committed to publishing a detailed annual programme in relation to individual major school projects commencing construction.  In this context, annual programmes have been published for 2012 and 2013.  Details of the building projects including projects in the areas, referred to by the Deputy, that are projected to commence construction in 2014 were announced on 29th November 2013.  The 5 Year Plan and annual programmes, in question, are also detailed on the website.  In addition, due to additional funding made available for the schools' building programme as part of the Government's &quot;Investing in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot; package announced earlier this year, 28 school projects that were not contained in the 5 year programme but have completed extensive architectural planning are now being progressed to tender and construction.  A project for a replacement school in Dublin 1 is included in this package.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the Prefab Replacement initiative 2012, approval was given to 170 schools nationally to replace 458 prefab units with permanent accommodation.  In excess of &euro;42 million was allocated for this initiative.  In June 2013, I announced a further initiative to replace prefab units with permanent accommodation.  A total of &euro;15 million has been allocated in 2013/2014 for this purpose.  Forty six schools with 115 prefab units have been offered grants to provide the new facilities.  For the Deputy's convenience, a list of the major new school and extension projects being undertaken in Dublin 1, 3 and 7 is outlined.  The Deputy will also be aware of my announcement on Thursday, 20th March last, of almost &euro;36 million for school improvements under the first round of the Summer Works Scheme for 2014.  Details of the approved schools may also be viewed on the website.</p><p><table><tr><th>School Name</th><th>Listed</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin 7 Education Together NS, Glasnevin</td><td>5 Year Capital Programme 2015/16</td></tr><tr><td>Bunscoil Colaiste Mhuire, Dublin 1</td><td>5 Year Capital Programme 2014/15</td></tr><tr><td>North Dublin Muslim School, Cabra</td><td>5 Year Capital Programme 2014/15</td></tr><tr><td>Gaelscoil Bharra, Cabra</td><td>5 Year Capital Programme 2014/15</td></tr><tr><td>St Laurence O'Toole Special School, Dublin 1</td><td>Announced in 2013 &quot;Investing in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot;package</td></tr><tr><td>St John Bosco Senior Boys School, Cabra</td><td>Prefab Initiative Scheme 2013</td></tr><tr><td>Scoil Naomh Eoin Bosco Cabra</td><td>Prefab Initiative Scheme 2013</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In fact additional CPD has already been provided for subject specialist teachers and also for school leaders.  A full day per year has also been granted for whole school consideration of the Junior Cycle reform, subject to Board of Management approval.  The pace of implementation has also been slowed.</p><p>  A National Working Group for Junior Cycle has been set up as a forum to proactively address identified challenges as they arise over the phased implementation time schedule for the Junior Cycle.  My officials are currently engaged in intensive discussions with the education stakeholders on the resources including the detailed modalities in relation to workload and implementation issues for schools and teachers; on quality assurance and teacher assessment and on the professional development required to support teachers and school leaders to implement the Junior Cycle.</p><p>  I expect to receive a detailed report on these issues from the National Working Group in May.  School management bodies, Educate Together and parents have made written proposals to the Department of Education and Skills which include their views  on the resources required.  This is under active consideration.  However, Unions have refused to put proposals in writing in relation to the implementation issues highlighted, despite repeated requests.  Their oral position is that, unless there is an external high-stakes examination, reform will not work.  I have confidence in the professionalism and integrity of our teachers.  I have provided additional CPD and am considering other resources which will provide teachers, students, parents and the wider community with confidence in the new junior cycle as it is rolled out.  Such assessment models work in many other countries and I believe with the right supports it will work in Ireland.  </p><p>  My officials are in dialogue through the National Working Group.

Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school, whereas for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for.  The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.  The Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  They will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date.  The Educational Welfare Services, Child and Family Agency, can be contacted at 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  The NCSE also recently published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School.  This guide is also available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  Finally, where a parent seeks to enrol their child in a school and that school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p></reply>

The contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector (see following link) specifically requires that SNAs are required to work the month of June on examinations and work appropriate to the grade including training.  This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (IMPACT and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005.  This condition of service places a clear onus and obligation on the SNA to attend at their place of work and be available for work during the month of June.</p><p>  It is a matter for school management as their employer to determine the precise work that is to be completed by SNAs during the month of June.  The utilisation of this period is not specifically for examinations or training purposes only, although these are two of the purposes for which the period of work can be utilised.  Link to the SNA Contract of Employment for the Post Primary sector: Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary) .  This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs.

The level of resources devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained and increased for this school year.  Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &ndash; some &euro;1.3 billion &ndash; was spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs in 2012/13.  The provision for the 2013/14 school year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that the overall level of funding for special education has been protected, and increased, despite the ongoing severe financial position.  The provision now includes 10,745 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), over 10,700 Learning Support and Resource Teachers, provision for over 740 Special Classes attached to mainstream schools at reduced pupil teacher ratios, enhanced capitation for special schools and special classes and provision for special transport arrangements and assistive technology support.</p><p>  The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided.  All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs to be enrolled to.  Supports will continue to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs.  </p><p>In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.  740 Special Classes are being provided for mainstream schools for the current school year.  This includes 118 new special classes which have been opened this year.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the previous Government capped the number of SNA posts at 10,575 in December 2010.  In December 2013, this Government agreed to increase the cap on SNAs by 390, increasing by 170 posts to 10,745 at the end of 2013, and by a further 220 posts to 10,965 at the end of 2014.  These additional posts provided will enable the National Council for Special Education to continue to allocate support to children who need it in order that they may fully participate in and benefit from their education.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my decision last June to authorise the NCSE to maintain the level of resource teaching allocations to be provided for students with special educational needs for the current school year to the 2012/13 levels.  This decision resulted in the subsequent allocation of an additional 455 posts in October to maintain resource teaching provision at the same levels as last year.  The overall level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs, enrolled in all schools, to ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements, for the current school year and in future school years.</p></reply>

However for the significant minority of schools, it is important to note that there are a range of measures in place to improve assessment practices in primary and post-primary schools in tandem with the implementation of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and Junior Cycle reform.  The Teaching Council has taken steps to ensure that assessment is a core component of Initial Teacher Education programmes for student teachers at both primary and post-primary level.</p><p>  At primary level, schools are advised to use a variety of assessment methods to support assessment of pupils' progress and achievement, and to extend and enrich their learning.  Guidelines on assessment published by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) support schools in this regard, particularly in their understanding and use of Assessment for Learning approaches.  A range of materials on Assessment for Learning is also available on the website of the NCCA and the Professional Development Service for Teachers as a support for primary and post-primary teachers.</p><p>  Primary schools are required to administer standardised tests in English reading and Mathematics, and in the case of Irish medium schools standardised tests in Irish, to their pupils at three points in the primary cycle (2nd, 4th and Sixth classes) and report the results to the Board of Management of the school and to the Department of Education and Skills.  School principals in all primary schools have had opportunities to attend seminars on school self evaluation which included guidance on the analysis of standardised test data among other assessment data and its use to inform improvements in the teaching and learning of literacy and numeracy.  At post-primary level, the move to school based assessment will radically change and improve assessment practices at Junior Cycle.  The introduction of school-based components in all subjects where teachers assess the work of their students will bring assessment activity closer to the point where teaching and learning occurs and provide more opportunity to improve the learning experiences and achievements of students.  It will also provide opportunity for the development of students' skills and competences in areas of learning that are inevitably minimised in a terminal, external examination.  Teachers' engagement in moderation processes with other teachers to review the marking of students' work will enhance their understanding of standards and their capacity to judge the quality of  students' work.</p><p>  As part of the roll out of the new Junior Cycle, teachers of each subject will receive a minimum of four days continuing professional development which will include a significant focus on the use of assessment for both formative and summative purposes.  In addition, the Junior Cycle Assessment and Moderation Toolkit on the NCCA's website will support and assist teachers in their work on assessment.  The Toolkit will include the range of assessment supports, advice, guidelines and exemplification that will enable schools and teachers to engage with all aspects of the new assessment system at Junior Cycle.  The State Examinations Commission for the majority of subjects will set the terminal examination papers and provide teachers with detailed marking schemes.  In addition, for the interim, the SEC will continue to administer the terminal examinations in Irish, English and mathematics when the new specifications are introduced.</p></reply>

However, the report does highlight a number of areas in relation to the teaching of Irish where improvement is required.  My Department has already put a range of support measures in place, particularly in relation to curriculum, assessment and teacher education, as part of its ongoing implementation of the 20 Year Strategy for Irish.</p><p>  At initial teacher education stage, measures to enhance the development of Irish teaching skills are key parts of the reconfiguration of primary and relevant post-primary programmes.  Both programmes have been extended by one year.  The Teaching Council has been asked to work with teacher education institutions to raise standards among Irish teachers.  All teachers have a professional responsibility to ensure that they keep their knowledge and skills up to date by evaluating their practice on an ongoing basis and engaging in appropriate continuing professional development (CPD).  My Department supports teachers in this endeavour by providing a wide range of CPD opportunities.</p><p>  In Irish in particular there has been significant investment in CPD in recent years, such as: - CPD in relation to the national literacy and numeracy strategy for primary teachers and post-primary teachers, including specific provision for teachers in Irish medium schools and a commitment to offering 20 hours of CPD over the course of 5 years to certain teachers. - CPD for post primary teachers of Irish from 2007 - 2012 provided by the Seirbh&iacute;s Taca&iacute;ochta Dara Leibh&eacute;al don Ghaeilge.  This team has now been integrated with the Professional Development Service for Teachers and continues to provide CPD for teachers of Irish as part of the literacy strategy  - CPD provided by the T&uacute;s Maith team at primary level from 2006  - CPD for post-primary teachers of Irish in the context of the new junior cycle Irish specification will begin in the school year 2015/2016.</p><p>  Work has commenced on the development of a new specification for Irish at primary level relating to the integrated languages (Irish and English).  The NCCA is about to consult on a Primary Language curriculum (Stages 1 and 2 - junior infant classes through to second class).  In addition the NCCA has just completed its consultation of a background paper on Irish for the Junior Cycle.  Based on the findings of the consultation, the new specification will be developed for implementation in schools for first years from September 2016.  This specification will clarify the learning outcomes to be achieved by students and place an increased emphasis on the development of oral language skills.  Consideration is also being given to the introduction of a short course in Irish in Junior Cycle particularly for Irish students in the Gaeltacht, or students in Gaelcholaist&iacute; who would like the opportunity to study additional Irish.</p><p>  Since June 2012, the weighting for oral Irish proficiency in the Leaving Certificate was increased from 25% to 40%.  The impact of this change is being reviewed and the findings will be available in 2014.  An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG) has been co-located with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) so that the development of curricula and support materials for Irish (this is a key part of the remit of COGG) can take place in a closely co-ordinated way.  My Department is providing 0.5 million euro over the next three years to allow for the digitisation of the S&eacute;adain S&iacute;.</p></reply>

Primary inspectors also judged that pupils' learning was appropriately consolidated in 86% of Maths lessons.</p><p>  At second level, inspectors judged the quality of teaching in Maths to be satisfactory or better in 77% of Maths lessons and they judged the quality of learning to be satisfactory or better in 74% of lessons.  However, the report does highlight a number of areas in relation to the teaching of Mathematics, particularly at second level, where improvement is required.</p><p>  At primary level, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is to commence the development of a revised mathematics curriculum for primary schools that will link with the structure of the junior cycle maths syllabus.  At second level new Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate Mathematics syllabuses were introduced to address issues with teaching and learning mathematics, to move away from rote learning and to deepen students' understanding of the subject by: Changing the mathematics syllabi for both junior and senior cycle; Changing the focus of certificate examinations in mathematics; Providing a comprehensive in-service programmes for all mathematics teachers; Providing comprehensive classroom resources (both hard copy and on-line).</p><p>  The introduction of Project Maths was supported by the introduction of a Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching to upskill 'out-of-field' teachers of Mathematics which was launched in September 2012.  The course is jointly accredited by the University of Limerick and NUI Galway and some 600 teachers are participating in this Diploma.  The Professional Diploma represents an investment of &euro;3.267 million to date.</p><p>  There have been concerns that students are not confident enough to study for higher level mathematics in the Leaving Certificate.  To encourage more students to study and to then present for certification at the higher level, the third level institutions have allocated 25 bonus points to students who achieve a grade D or above in higher level mathematics.  This has resulted in an increase in participation.  In 2011 some 15.8% of the Leaving Certificate candidates sat the higher level paper.  This had risen to 25.6% in 2013.  In all, this was a rise of 58% over 3 years.  The number of students who have indicated that they wish to sit the higher level examination this summer has also risen.  Some 17,181 students have indicated their intention to take higher level &ndash; up 70% on this time in 2011.  Of course some students may reverse this decision but students' confidence in their ability to take higher level mathematics is rising.</p></reply>

At second level, inspectors judged that teachers' preparation for teaching was satisfactory or better in the vast majority of lessons: an efficient lesson sequence was evident in 90% of lesson and teachers selected appropriate resources to support teaching and learning in 85% of lessons.</p><p>  My Department has made a significant investment over the last decade in supporting schools to engage in school development planning and school self-review.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) continues to provide high quality continuous professional development and support for teachers, at primary and post-primary levels.  </p><p>The National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT) provides newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers with comprehensive advice and planning guidelines that are of significant support to teachers in both mainstream and special education settings.  Department Good Practice Guides, such as Effective literacy and numeracy practices in DEIS schools (2009), highlight the centrality of effective, strategic, collaborative planning.</p><p>  The Programme for Government, 2011, sets out specific targets in relation to self-evaluation and school improvement.  Similarly, the National Strategy to improve Literacy and Numeracy, Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life, requires all schools to engage in robust self-evaluation.  School Self-Evaluation Guidelines were prepared by the Inspectorate, with the assistance of schools and the education partners, to provide practical support, to assist schools in affirming good practice and to have a clear focus on the specific areas that need to be targeted for improvement or development.</p><p>  A dedicated SSE website () contains resources, evaluation tools, video materials from schools that have engaged in SSE and completed examples of school self-evaluation reports and school improvement plans.  By June 2014 schools are required to have their first SSE report completed and a school improvement plan (SIP) in place.  To support schools as they engage in the data gathering analysis and improvement planning process within SSE, during 2012 and 2013 Department inspectors have visited and provided advice to 3710 schools or approximately 94% of all primary and post-primary schools.  Such advice included advice about all aspects of teaching and learning, including planning and preparation is a normal part of all evaluation activities by the Inspectorate.</p></reply>

The most recent data available is therefore in respect of the last quarter in 2013.  Staff numbers are reported in two categories: academic and non-academic.    </p><p>  At the end of Q4 2013, UCD reported that there were 1,128 whole time equivalent (WTE) non-academic staff and 952 academic staff provided for from Exchequer funding.  This figure includes 513 (WTE) Lecturer and 195 (WTE) Senior Lecturer posts.</p><p>  It should be noted the 1,128 non-academic staff includes a range of categories of support staff in an institution including administrative staff.  Non-academic staff are involved in student focused functions such as student admissions and registration, campus service centres, assessment and library as well as the more traditional back office functions such as ICT support, finance and payroll.  The non-academic category of staff may also include support staff involved in activities related to research such as administrative support and laboratory technicians.  </p><p>The number of students enrolled in institutions is reported on an academic year basis.  In 2012/13 (most recent data available), UCD had 23,931 students enrolled and this includes full and part-time students studying at undergraduate and postgraduate level.</p><p>  Number of Lecture Contact Hours with 1st Year Students (UCD) in Arts, Engineering , Business  and Pre-Med.<table><tr><th>Student Class</th><th>No. of hours</th></tr><tr><td>Arts</td><td>14.1 hours per week</td></tr><tr><td>Engineering</td><td>23.95 hours per week</td></tr><tr><td>Business</td><td>16.25 hours per week</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Med</td><td>16 hours per week</td></tr></table></p><p>(i)   Student class contact hours will vary from week to week according to the particular modules taken.  The figures represent the average weekly student class contact hours.</p><p>(ii)  Students undertake a range of activities involving contact with staff.  These include lectures, tutorials, seminars, practicals and small group work which will vary by subject and by module.</p><p>(iii) A typical UCD 5 credit module will expect a total effort of between 100 and 125 hours from a student with variations in the balance between class contact and other forms of learning.</p><p>(iv) Students taking programmes in UCD typically have the opportunity to take up to ten ECTS credits outside their main programme area &ndash; UCD Horizons electives &ndash; and so will not necessarily share the same contact hour load with their programme cohort.  </p><p>(v)  Students in UCD may have access to option modules (e.g. &lsquo;choose two of the following four ...&rsquo;) and so will not necessarily share the same contact hour load with their programme cohort.</p><p>(vi) These numbers do not include repeat or other partial registrations where individual circumstances rather than programme design determine a given student&rsquo;s workload.</p></reply>

The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.

Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school and others with more complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. The Model A document referred to by the Deputy became outdated in that it refers to specific models of provision. I do not have a specific date from which the prescribed model became outdated.</p><p>  Details on the numbers of early intervention classes for children with autism who use ABA are not available as this information, while available in individual schools, has not been collated by my Department.  However this does not suggest that schools are not compliant with my Department's child centred approach to the education of children with autism.  The Board of Management has a formal role under the Education Act to ensure that all Departmental policies are adhered to in their individual schools.  Schools are supported in this regard by NEPS and the Inspectorate who have a formal role in evaluating, advising and supporting schools.</p><p>  Support is also provided to teachers, through the Special Education Support Service (SESS), who provide continuing professional development in a range of autism specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).</p><p>  As outlined in my previous response, SESS has a number of teams involved in the provision of CPD and support to teachers of students with challenging behaviour; the Challenging Behaviour Team, the Autism Team and the Contemporary Applied Behaviour Analysis Team. I am satisfied that the SESS are making appropriate provision to support teachers and schools in this area. I should also point out that SESS is a support service for teachers and is not involved in the supervision of the implementation of ABA.</p><p>  My Department is conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available. Further to an encouragement of the Ombudsman for Children and mindful that greater clarity on my Department's policy on the education of children with autism would be useful for schools and parents, my Department commenced collating a statement of existing policy last year.  Subsequently given that the National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities I requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.</p><p>  The NCSE has advised that the policy advice will be delivered in the spring of 2015 and will draw upon findings gathered from an extensive consultation process which has already commenced. In this context I have forwarded the two pieces of research previously referred to by the Deputy to the NCSE. I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. Students must meet both the nationality and residency criterion in order to be considered under the scheme.</p><p>  Where students do not qualify for free fees they must pay the appropriate fee as determined by their third level institution.  The institutions are autonomous and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees schemes are matters for the relevant institution.

This could result in a full or partial exemption from some of the learning involved in that programme. As the Institute of Bankers is now a recognised college of UCD, it may be most useful to approach UCD in the first instance. With regard to the suitability of the qualifications concerned for teaching in second or third level colleges, all teachers at post-primary level must have their qualifications recognised by, and be registered with, the Teaching Council.

This policy is in line with the provisions of the EPSEN Act 2004.</p><p>  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p><p>  Other children may have such complex needs that they require specialist supports in a special school.</p><p>  Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</p><p>  My Department therefore provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>  This Government is committed to the protection of front-line services for pupils with special educational needs. The level of resources devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained and increased for this school year.</p><p>  Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &ndash; some &euro;1.3 billion &ndash; was spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs in 2012/13. The provision for the 2013/14 school year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that the overall level of funding for special education has been protected, and increased, despite the ongoing severe financial position.</p><p>  Inter alia, this provides for additional learning and resource teaching support, Special Needs Assistant support, special transport arrangements, building adaptations, enhanced capitation and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</p><p>  The overall level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs in both mainstream and special schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE Report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  While the report recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible, the report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term. While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has made a number of recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>  It also recommends that under a proposed new allocation model, all children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.</p><p>  The Chairperson of the Working Group established to develop this proposal, submitted its report to me on 5th March and I will now consider the report's recommendations.</p></reply>

The fees were determined in accordance with QQI's policy and fees which provides, inter alia, that fees will be comprehensive, coherent and reflect the amount and complexity of the work undertaken by QQI.</p><p>  There is a significant amount of work involved in assessing applications from providers seeking access to QQI's awards, so that QQI can be assured that they meet their rigorous quality standards. The purpose of those standards is to ensure that providers have the capacity to provide quality programmes of education and training to their learners. The fees therefore underpin QQI's ability to ensure and monitor compliance with its standards. Furthermore, and importantly, the fees help to ensure that only those providers which are serious about complying with those standards, and have the capacity to do so, apply to QQI.</p><p>  It is not possible to estimate the total cost of these fees to the community and voluntary sector as that is entirely dependent on the number of providers from that sector which apply to QQI for initial access to validation and on the number and type of programmes which those providers submit for validation by QQI.</p><p>  At the meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection on 19 February, representatives from QQI committed to continue to consult with stakeholders from the community and voluntary sector in order to explore how that sector can continue to provide quality education and training to learners.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. Section 29 Appeal Forms are available on my Departments website at the following link . or from Section 29 Appeals Administration Unit, Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, phone 0761 108584.</p><p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil's area. The contact details for the EWS is Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency, Heritage Business Park, Bessboro Road, Mahon, Cork, phone number 021-4536314.</p><p>  The Deputy maybe aware that the draft General Scheme and draft regulations were referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, to allow a full public discussion, including inputs from parents and the education partners. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection invited written submissions from interested individuals or groups in relation to the Draft General Scheme of an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013. The closing date for submissions to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection was Thursday 31 October 2013.</p><p>  The Committee considered the submissions received, and invited individuals and groups to a public hearing where it felt that this was beneficial. The Committee's report was published on 05 March 2014. The report will be carefully considered before progressing to the next stage of legislation. </p></reply>

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. Students must meet both the nationality and residency criterion in order to be considered under the scheme.</p><p>  With effect from the current academic year a 'Change of Nationality' clause is included in the scheme which provides that, subject to meeting the criteria of the scheme, students who acquire EEA citizenship during their course of third level studies may be eligible for free fees for the remainder of their studies subject to certain conditions.</p><p>  Where students do not qualify for free fees they must pay the appropriate fee as determined by their third level institution. The institutions are autonomous and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees schemes is a matter for the relevant institution.

Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.</p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.</p><p>  The Department has contacted primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.  Schools that indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental/loan scheme will not therefore qualify for funding.</p></reply>

To date, the Government has published three annual progress reports, the most recent of which was published earlier this month and which sets out the progress over the last 12 months of an extensive number of commitments (relevant extracts attached).</p><p>  With regard to the commitments relating to my Department, the annual report sets out in detail progress made on issues such as:- Empowering schools to improve standards- Protecting front-line services in education- Enactment of legislation establishing the Education and Training Boards and SOLAS, the Further Education and Training Authority- Implementing the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy- Investing in the School Building Programme- Delivering Equity in Education- Supporting Children with Special Needs- Promoting inclusiveness in primary schools- Reforming the Irish curriculum in schools- Reforming Third Level Education.</p><p>  I would also refer the Deputy to my statement to the D&aacute;il on the 5th of March where I set out the progress made in the Education Sector since the present Government took office in 2011 and outlined my priorities for 2014.</p><p><b>Programme for Government: 2014 Annual Report </b></p><p><b>Extracts relating to Commitments relevant to the Department of Education and Skills</b><table><tr><th>Commitment</th><th>Relevant Extract in 2014 Annual Report</th></tr><tr><td>- We will provide a range of initiatives to increase access to further higher level education for the unemployed.<br /><br /><br /></td><td>To-date over 40,800 additional training and education places have been provided exceeding the 30,000 target set out in the Programme for Government: </td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- Within this total, we will provide 30,000 additional training places across the education and training system, distributed in line with the recommendations of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.<br /><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br />-  5,800 places on the F&Aacute;S Specific Skills Training programme-  More than 15,000 places have been provided under the three rounds of the Springboard programme that have issued to date.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- We will expand training options for jobseekers across the VEC, further and higher education sectors to facilitate upskilling of the labour force. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br /> <br /><br />- 1,500 places have been provided for jobseekers under two rounds of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes since 2012.- 9,000 places on the Back to Education Initiative 2011-2013- 3,000 Post Leaving Certificate places 2011-2013- 6,500 Momentum places (Labour Market Education and Training Fund)<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>- A National Strategy for International Education will be implemented, to develop the &lsquo;Education Ireland&rsquo; brand, to encourage more international students to study here and to create new jobs in the sector. </td><td>A public consultation was launched last year as part of a review of Ireland&rsquo;s International Education Strategy which targets the six priority markets of USA, China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia along with new scholarship opportunities in emerging markets. This will form the basis for a new Government Action Plan for International Education highlighting measures to be taken over the period 2014-2016 to enhance our educational relationships with priority and emerging markets and enhance the economic return to Ireland in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>- Our objective will be to double the number of international students studying in Ireland, particularly targeting students from India, China and the Middle East. <br /><br /><br /></td><td>- Ministerial-led Education missions took place in Brazil, China and the Gulf in 2013 to deepen education links and attract more students from new and growing countries. As part of the Ministerial mission to China, 13 agreements between Irish and Chinese education institutions were signed and the Minister officially opened the Beijing-Dublin International College, a joint venture of UCD and Beijing University of Technology.<br /><br /><br />- Already 5,000 Chinese students and 1,200 Brazilian students attend Irish higher education institutes and the number of 3rd level Indian students studying in Ireland is set to double by 2015.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- This policy will be pursued in line with employment, academic and skill requirements of overall economy and education sector.<br /><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br />Interactions with the Education in Ireland brand through its website and the various social media channels supported was over 856,000 in 2013, up from around 30,000 this time last year.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>- Undertake a full review of the Hunt and OECD reports into third level funding before end of 2011. </td><td>At present in Ireland there are 39 higher education institutions in receipt of over &euro;1 billion State funding, serving around 170,000 students. Following a yearlong process of research, analysis and engagement, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) made a series of recommendations on system re-configuration in Irish higher education and implementation of these reforms is underway.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- We will introduce radical reform in third level institutions to maximise existing funding, in particular reform of academic contracts and will encourage greater specialisation by educational institutions.<br /><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br />The HEA has been asked to establish regional clusters of institutions in three identified regions, involving all seven universities and 14 Institutes. Each of these will now develop regional plans, eliminating unnecessary<br /><br /><br />duplication of provision and establishing clear pathways of transfer and progression for students in the region.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><br /><br />A new system performance framework is being put in place during 2014 by the HEA which will assess system performance against the national priorities, system objectives and key indicators published in 2013.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- We will initiate a time-limited audit of level 8 qualifications on offer and learning outcomes for graduates of these courses.</td><td><br /><br />The &lsquo;Supporting a Better Transition from Second Level to Higher Education&rsquo; report, published in 2013, committed to significantly reduce the number of level 8 degree programmes in higher education and make them more broadly-based. Following publication, a consultation process and further detailed research was undertaken including a major conference held in NUI Maynooth in June involving key stakeholders. A framework for implementation will be agreed during 2014.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- We will explore the establishment of a multi campus Technical University in the South East. </td><td><br /><br />In May, the HEA was instructed to implement recommendations arising from their report on Irish Higher Education relating to the proposed consolidation of three groups of Institutes of Technology to progress towards attaining Technological University status:<br /><br /><br />- The Dublin Institute of Technology, IT Tallaght and IT Blanchardstown<br /><br /><br />- Cork IT and IT Tralee<br /><br /><br />- Waterford IT and Carlow IT<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><br /><br />A fourth group, the Connacht-Ulster Alliance (Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology; Sligo IT and Letterkenny IT) have indicated that they are deepening their existing alliance with a view to merging in the medium term.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br />The general scheme of a Technological Universities Bill has been published which will allow for the future establishment of Technological Universities and the mergers of institutes of technology.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>-  We will require schools, with the support of the Inspectorate, to draw up five year development plans for their schools and individual teachers. </td><td>External inspections of schools by the Inspectorate have become more frequent, with half of all primary schools inspected in the period 2010-12 and 93% of post-primary schools inspected in 2011 and 2012. As part of the new School Self Evaluation Model, each year all schools are required to self-evaluate one aspect of teaching and learning, to prepare a report on this and to provide a summary report to the school community. They are also required to prepare a school improvement plan outlining the targets and actions they will take over a three-year period to improve</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- The system for evaluating schools will be reformed so parents have access to more information when choosing a school for their family. A new system of self-evaluation will be introduced, requiring all schools to evaluate their own performance year on year and publish information across a wide range of criteria.</td><td>They are also required to prepare a school improvement plan outlining the targets and actions they will take over a three-year period to improve practice in this aspect of teaching and learning. Schools are required to provide the first summary SSE report and School Improvement Plan no later than the end of the 2013/14 school year.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>- We will give greater freedom and autonomy to school principals and boards to raise educational standards by devolving more responsibility locally, with greater freedom to allocate and manage staff with required flexibility and to delegate management responsibilities to teachers as school priorities require.</td><td>Ensuring more responsibility and accountability at school level is a core part of reforms in relation to curriculum &amp;amp; assessment, teacher performance and the literacy and numeracy strategy. Curriculum reforms, like junior cycle reform, will require schools to take ownership for curriculum and assessment issues.<br /><br /><br />A key objective of the new of School Self Evaluation model, introduced in 2012, is to make schools responsible and accountable for their educational outcomes and this will involve schools producing school improvement plans and annual reports on the self- evaluation process by the end of the school year 2014.</td></tr><tr><td>- A priority in education will be to recruit, train and support the highest calibre of teachers. School leadership will be fundamental to furthering this aim. </td><td>Considerable progress is being made towards the proposed 6 new centres for education with the HEA in discussions with the institutions concerned and funding in place to help with the costs involved in the transitions. From January 2014, teachers employed in State-funded teaching positions in schools must be registered with the Teaching Council in order to be paid from State funds. This paves the way for the implementation relating to the Council&rsquo;s investigative and disciplinary functions and to undertake inquiries into the professional conduct of teachers.</td></tr><tr><td>- Education will be a priority for this Government.   It will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.   To that end, it will endeavour to protect front-line services in education, and seek efficiencies in work and school practices, in line with the Croke Park Agreement.</td><td>Budget 2014 provided for an additional 1,400 teachers to be recruited in primary and post-primary schools in 2014. The projected saving in the education sector under the pay and productivity measures contained in the Haddington Road Agreement is &euro;600 million over its lifetime, including:<br /><br /><br />- 43 hours of supervision and substitution duties per teacher per annum without payment - Third-level academic staff will work 78 additional hours each per annum <br /><br /><br />- The working week of administrative grades has been increased and standardised.</td></tr><tr><td>- We will review Junior and Leaving Certificate systems and implement reforms necessary to encourage greater innovation and independent learning, building on the NCCA&rsquo;s work in this area.<br /><br /><br /></td><td>Implementation of the new reformed Junior Cycle, renamed the Junior Cycle Student Award (JCSA), commences in September 2014 with a new English syllabus to be followed by a new Science curriculum in September 2015 and other subjects incrementally until full reform is achieved in 2022.  &euro;4.8 million is being provided in 2014 to allow up to 7,000 school personnel, including principals and teachers of English, to receive training for the reformed Junior Cycle.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- Maths and science teaching at second level will be reformed, including making science a compulsory Junior Cert subject by 2014. Professional development for maths and science teachers will be prioritised. </td><td><br /><br />The second intake of Maths teachers for the Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching saw a further 300 teachers admitted to the programme in September. A dedicated programme of in-school, online and workshop supports for Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths teachers continued in 2013.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />- A bonus points system for maths, which is linked to specific maths or science courses, will be introduced to encourage greater participation in courses where skills shortages currently exist.</td><td><br /><br />Schools involved in the pilot Project Maths initiative sat exams at Junior and Leaving Certificate in all strands of the new programme in 2013. Students in all other mainstream schools sat exams with a Project Maths component for the first time. Participation at higher level in Science at Junior Cycle was up to 79% from 76% in 2012 with overall participation in Science at Junior Cycle at 90.1%. 52% of Junior Certificate students opted to take higher level maths paper compared to 48% in 2012. In 2013, 26% (13,014) of all Leaving Certificate Mathematics students took the Higher Level paper &ndash; the highest figure on record.</td></tr><tr><td>A national literacy strategy for children and young people will be developed as a matter of urgency, with school-level targets that are related to national targets. Every school will be required to have a literacy action plan, with demonstrable outcomes. Responsibility for achieving these outcomes will be vested in the school principals, who will also receive continuous professional development to support the implementation of the strategy. </td><td>Progress during 2013 on the implementation of the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy included:<br /><br />- Provision of relevant workshops to Teachers on Comprehension, Oral Language, Guided Reading, English as an Additional Language, Infant Maths and Problem Solving;<br /><br />- Reconfigured and extended post-graduate programmes for both primary and post-primary teachers to commence in September 2014;<br /><br />- Collation of school based standardised testing on literacy and numeracy;<br /><br />- &lsquo;The Family Project&rsquo; developed in partnership with NALA was screened on TV and showcased the educational tools and techniques that are available to all families;<br /><br />- All new preschool leaders to have a minimum of full award at Level 6 from September and existing preschool leaders by 2015 which includes a mandatory literacy and numeracy module.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Pre-service and in-service training in teaching of literacy for all primary and secondary school teachers will be improved, with dedicated literacy mentors to work intensively with teachers in most disadvantaged primary schools.</td><td><br /><br />There are now 40 primary and 14 post-primary literacy and numeracy advisors within the Professional Development Service for Teachers. The Strategy requires all schools to set specific targets for the promotion and improvement of literacy and numeracy. To date over 71,000 training places have been made available to all teachers, both primary and post primary, who are leading the roll out of support for the strategy. Over the course of the 10 year strategy, teachers will be charged with accessing 20 hours of Continuous Professional Development and sufficient provision will be made for them to access same.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />DEIS primary schools will be required to teach literacy for 120 minutes per day; non-DEIS schools to teach literacy for 90 minutes per day. This time includes incorporating structured literacy tuition into teaching of other subjects. <br /><br /><br /></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />A longer term aim of this Government will be to position Ireland in the top ten performing countries in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).<br /><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br />The latest OECD PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) results demonstrate significantly improved performance by Ireland since 2009, when compared to the 34 OECD countries. Ireland&rsquo;s 15 year olds are ranked 4th for reading &ndash; up 13 places, 9th for science &ndash; up 5 places and 13th for maths &ndash; up 13 places. International comparisons at primary level are also positive: Ireland&rsquo;s fourth class pupils are ranked 10th out of 45 countries in the PIRLS reading test and 17th out of 50 countries in the TIMSS mathematics test.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>- A new plan to develop ICT in teaching, learning and assessment will be developed. This plan will incorporate the integration of ICT policy across other agencies, such as the Professional Development Services for Teachers, the State Examinations Commission, and Project Maths. </td><td>A public consultation was launched in December with parents, teachers, students, industry and academics asked for their views on how best to make use of computers and technology in the classroom. This follows a comprehensive online survey of principals and teachers earlier in 2013 on the use of ICT in teaching and learning in primary and post primary schools, all of which will feed into a new Digital Strategy for Schools in 2014.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- The primary priority for investment in ICT in the immediate term will be the integration of ICT in teaching and learning across the curriculum and investing in broadband development to ensure schools have access to fibre-powered broadband. Investment in ICT will be maximised through pooling of ICT procurement.</td><td><br /><br />In 2013, contracts were awarded under the high speed network for a further 234 second-level schools in the counties of Dublin, Kildare and Meath which will bring the total to 516 schools connected when complete. The final stage will see the remaining 269 schools in the south connected during 2014.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- Greater use of online platforms will be made to offer a wide range of subjects and lessons online, and to enable schools to &lsquo;share&rsquo; teachers via live web casts. These online lessons will be made available through a new Digital School Resource, bringing together existing resources from National Council for Curriculum Assessment, Department of Education and other sources as a cost effective means of sharing expertise between schools. <br /><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br />Following a tender process in 2013, the Department&rsquo;s portal website, Scoilnet.ie, was redeveloped and migrated to a platform that will support the inclusion and sharing of learning objects. The new website will collate all relevant resources produced by the Department&rsquo;s skills support services in recent years, and make them available in the repository under open licences for teachers to adapt and reuse as they see fit. Other public sector bodies and Departments with educational content will be encouraged to make it available within the repository under open licences. Rollout is commencing early in 2014. <br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br /> - The objective of this Government will be to progressively phase out the inefficient renting of school prefabs. In the interim the negotiation of prefab rental contracts will be part of a reformed public procurement policy to encourage greater value for money, transparency and reduce dependency on temporary accommodation.  </td><td>Capital investment in schools continued in 2013 with a total of 44 major school projects completed, comprising 29 primary and 15 post-primary schools, providing a total of 13,767 permanent school places and enhanced facilities for almost 8,000 pupils. A further 3,220 schools at primary level benefited from the 2013 &euro;28 million once-off Minor Works Grant scheme.<br /><br /><br />- 70 school building projects were announced for 2014 as part of the &euro;2 billion five-year capital investment programme 2012 - 2016 which will deliver over 27,500 permanent school places. &euro;470 million will be spent on primary/post primary infrastructure next year and projected expenditure of &euro;290 million on large scale projects.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />- A second phase of the Prefab Replacement Initiative was announced in 2013 with an allocation of &euro;15 million. This will allow 46 schools to replace their prefabs with 119 mainstream classrooms and 37 resource rooms.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>-  The Department of Education&rsquo;s central database of school accommodation will be overhauled to ensure a complete inventory of school buildings and associated structures is maintained so deficiencies are easily identifiable</td><td><br /><br />Following the completion of a pilot study in Tuam, Navan, Clonmel, Portlaoise, and part of Limerick City, to develop an inventory of education infrastructure and related community assets, a project team has been appointed to progress the development of inventory data for the rest of the country.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- In areas of demographic growth, Shared Educational Campuses will be the preferred model for future development of educational infrastructure. New schools will be built to grow with their communities and to provide for more interactive, child-friendly model of education. <br /><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br />As part of the five-year capital programme there are a number of Shared Education Campuses being delivered in areas of demographic growth. Campuses have recently been completed in Dublin, Monaghan and Portlaoise, with delivery of the first phase of permanent accommodation also completed on campuses in Navan, Greystones and Luttrellstown.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>- We will consider recommendations of the review of the DEIS programme and use it as a platform for new initiatives to deliver better outcomes for students in disadvantaged areas.</td><td>The latest findings by the Educational Research Centre on longitudinal testing of reading and mathematics over the period 2007-2013 has found that test scores in urban DEIS primary schools at all grade levels have increased significantly. Gains are particularly evident in the junior grades and in schools that have high levels of disadvantage. Levels of pupil absence have also fallen from 10.8% in 2007 to 7.1% in 2013. Evaluation of the DEIS will continue during 2014 with further ERC reports expected.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- We will examine how to make existing expenditure on educational disadvantage more effective, and innovative ways in which teenagers at risk of leaving school system can stay connected, for example through use of ICT-based distance learning and projects such as iScoil. </td><td><br /><br />The latest Report on Retention Rates in Post Primary Schools show the Leaving Certificate retention rate in DEIS schools increased by almost 7 percentage points from 73.2% to 80.1%. It also shows that in 2011 the proportion of early school leavers in Ireland was 10.6%, down from 13% in 2004 and ahead of the EU average of 14%.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>- We will support diversity in education of children with special needs, recognising that both intensive education and mainstreaming can be seen to work for individual children. <br /><br /><br /></td><td>- An additional 390 Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts were approved by Government in 2013 bringing the total number of SNAs available for children with an assessed need in primary and post primary schools to almost 11,000. There are also now over 10,700 additional teachers in schools supporting children with special educational and learning support needs, up 695 since 2012 and more than at any time previously.<br /><br /><br />- In 2013, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) developed comprehensive policy advice on supporting children with special educational need in schools. The report showed that in 2012/2013 there were 31,202 pupils in mainstream education in receipt of NCSE allocated resource teaching, 3,678 pupils attending special classes attached to mainstream schools and a further 7,094 pupils attending special schools.<br /><br /><br />- The report recommends revising the current approach to allocating additional special educational teaching supports to schools to ensure the system is equitable and based on need. At the request of the Minister the NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for a new allocation model for teaching supports based on the profiled needs of children in schools, which is expected to report in Spring 2014.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- We recognise the critical importance of early diagnosis of autism and early intervention and address current deficits in this area. <br /><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br />The National Disability Implementation Plan 2013-2015 provides a framework for driving the delivery of real and meaningful improvements in the lives of people with disabilities. The National Disability Authority has been asked to examine how the actions already contained in the Plan can be tailored to the needs of people with autism and how any issues arising can be addressed within that framework. The consultation with stakeholders begins in early 2014. In addition the NCSE has been asked to prepare policy advice on educational provision for children with autism.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- We will reverse the cut to the number of psychologists in National Educational Psychological Service in Budget 2011.<br /><br /><br /></td><td><br /><br />There are currently 168 (WTE) educational psychologists employed within National Educational Psychological Service, an increase of 9 since 2010.<br /><br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>- We will encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying to support students.</td><td>An Action Plan on Bullying was launched in January 2013 to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools. The following actions were delivered in 2013:<br /><br /><br />- New anti-bullying procedures launched and being implemented by all 4,000 primary and post-primary schools<br /><br /><br />- 105 parent anti-bullying sessions delivered to 3,279 participants<br /><br /><br />- A phased programme of continuing professional development, developed to support teachers in schools in relation to the Action Plan and the Anti-Bullying Procedures<br /><br /><br />- Work began on updating guidelines for school staff and boards of management in relation to homophobic bullying</td></tr><tr><td>- We will undertake a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way in which Irish is taught at primary and second levels of education. We will reform the curriculum so more emphasis is put on oral and aural skills. We will allocate 50% of marks to the oral Irish exam at Leaving Certificate level.</td><td>Work is underway by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to inform the development of the new curriculum for Irish at Junior Cycle for implementation in September 2016. A public consultation process has recently concluded on a background paper by the NCCA on the issues that the new junior cycle specification should address. The NCCA will be engaging with stakeholders in 2014 on a new Primary Language Curriculum &ndash; for Junior Infant to Second Classes where languages are taught partly in relation to one another.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- We will aim to double the proportion of Irish students sitting the Higher Level Leaving Certificate exam by 2018.  </td><td></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />- We will take steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teaching of Irish at second level.   When these steps have been implemented, we will consider the question of whether Irish should be optional at Leaving Certificate. </td><td><br /><br />The number of students sitting Higher Level Irish in the Leaving Cert has increased year on year with 14,358 in 2011, to 15,937 in 2012 and 16,669 in 2013. A review by the NCCA of students&rsquo; experiences of the new assessment arrangements of the 40% allocation to the oral assessment is due to report soon. With a further 10% allocated to the aural exam, it means that 50% of marks are now allocated for language skills </td></tr></table></p></reply>

My Department also provides July Provision for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.</p><p>  As the home based provision takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme. It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Based July Provision generally reflects that required in a school environment.</p><p>  The qualification requirements for tutors providing tuition under the Home Based July Provision have not changed. It remains the case that home tutors should be fully qualified teachers. When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then alternative appropriate third level qualifications may be acceptable.</p><p>  However, since September 2013 for the Home Tuition Scheme and from this year for Home Based July Provision, my Department has also required that, in addition to being qualified teachers, tutors must be registered or have applied for registration with the Teaching Council of Ireland. Tutors with acceptable third level qualifications will be eligible to apply for registration.</p><p>  Accordingly, those whose qualifications were acceptable in the past remain eligible, provided they have applied for registration with the Teaching Council.

These documents may be downloaded and modified to suit each particular tender competition, and provides a consistent approach for contracting authorities to the management of public works projects.</p><p>  The Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) was introduced on a phased basis from 2007 and became mandatory for all contracting authorities through the issue of Department of Finance Circular 06/10 on 5 May 2010.  The documents are updated and augmented where appropriate to respond to new developments in the industry and changes in the regulatory environment.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the assessment of a tenderer's financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process because the contracting authority must be reasonably satisfied that a contractor will have the necessary capacity to carry out a contract if the contractor is awarded the contract. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.  My Department has developed specific national guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects; published as part of the Capital Works Management Framework (Guidance Note 2.3.1.3   Suitability Criteria for Works Contractors Minimum Standards refers.   )  In this regard, it is important to point out that there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Such requirements would logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.</p><p>  The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs. In this regard, my Department has issued public procurement guidelines (Circular 10/10) to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities. In relation to suitability criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.</p></reply>

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>  However, I understand that the European Commission issued guidance in 2010 that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards. This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives. The EU procurement directives primarily envisage that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract. For example, the EU Directives state that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, the fight against unemployment or the protection of the environment.</p><p>  Therefore the use of social clauses in public procurement is limited to instances where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.</p><p>  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract.</p><p>  The inclusion of social clauses in the procurement process would appear to be most suited to situations where the social benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority s policy or strategic plan. Experience in other Member States, would also indicate that social clauses will tend to be used for services and works contracts rather than supply contracts.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause; this may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another Member State. </p><p>  The use of a social clause requiring a contractor to recruit a certain percentage of those employed on a public works construction site from the ranks of the long term unemployed is being piloted on a limited number of schools projects under the Devolved Schools Build Programme Design and Build Framework, which is being administered by the National Development Finance Agency on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) last year approved the pilot initiative to be included in the NDFA Devolved Schools Programme.</p><p>  A framework of contractors has been set up for the Devolved Schools Programme, which consist of a mix of new builds, extensions and some remedial works to existing schools both at a primary and post primary level.  Three contracts were awarded in February off the Devolved Schools Programme.  The projects will be constructed using the public works contract for Building Works designed by the Contractor.  A clause has been included in the contract which requires that 10% of the person weeks worked on the contract be undertaken by individuals recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed.  There is also a requirement for 2.5% of the person weeks on the contract to be undertaken by apprentices.</p><p>  It is important to note that such a provision must be managed carefully both to ensure that the requirements set can be met and monitored but also consideration must be given to their impact on a sector that has experienced decline in output since 2008 as it may result in significant displacement of those already in employment.</p><p>  The contractor s compliance with this clause under the Devolved Schools Programme will be carefully monitored in accordance with the terms set out in the contract.  Once initial evaluations on the performance of the clause have been undertaken any necessary amendments will be tabled at GCCC before they are incorporated into the PPP element of the Stimulus Programme.</p><p>  The use of a social clause requiring a contractor to recruit a certain percentage of those employed on a public works construction site from the ranks of the long term unemployed is being piloted on a limited number of schools projects under the Devolved Schools Build Programme Design and Build Framework, which is being administered by the National Development Finance Agency on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) last year approved the pilot initiative to be included in the NDFA Devolved Schools Programme.</p></reply>

However, any such candidates are advised that even if successful at interview, an appointment to the post would be contingent on the securing of a work permit. </p><p>  Stamp 4 denotes and evidences a category of immigration permission to remain in the State (in accordance with the Immigration Act, 2004) that permits the holder to enter employment without the requirement to hold an employment permit issued by the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation.

The CFRAM Programme is a strategic approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  The Programme involves comprehensive co-ordination and consultation structures such as:</p><p>  - a high level National CFRAM Steering Group to provide guidance on the overall direction of the CFRAM Programme and comprising representatives from a number of relevant Government Departments and Agencies, as well as from the County and City Manager&rsquo;s Association;</p><p>  - a National CFRAM Stakeholder Group with representatives from organisational stakeholders with a national level of interest or coverage to provide a forum to inform such stakeholders of progress and the direction of the Programme and for these stakeholders to provide input to the Programme and;</p><p>  - at the level of the specific CFRAM projects, Steering Groups and Progress Groups with representatives of the OPW, relevant Regional and Local Authorities, the EPA and, for cross-border (International) River Basin Districts, the Rivers Agency of Northern Ireland. </p><p>  The CFRAM Programme also involves a significant engagement with communities and the public whereby the draft flood maps produced under the CFRAM will be subject to both informal and formal public consultation processes.  A similar level of detailed consultation with the public is involved in the development and implementation of OPW flood defence schemes with such scheme proposals being placed on formal Public Exhibition where the public are given the opportunity to comment on the proposals.</p><p>  On an ongoing basis, the OPW liaises with the National Parks and Wildlife Service in relation to the protection of wildlife and habitats in the context of flood defence works and with Waterways Ireland and the ESB in relation to water management protocols on the Shannon, Lee and Liffey.  The OPW also works closely with Inland Fisheries Ireland on an Environmental River Enhancement Programme and has concluded a Service Level Agreement with that body covering the period 2013 &ndash; 2017.</p><p>  The OPW is working closely with the insurance industry and has agreed a Memorandum of Understanding with Insurance Ireland on the format and protocols for the provision of information to the industry on completed OPW major flood defence schemes with a view to improving the availability of flood insurance cover in areas where the OPW, or local authorities with OPW funding, have carried out such schemes.</p></reply>

The group held its first meeting at the end of January. The group will examine procurement policy and its implementation with a view to improving SME access to procurement opportunities.</p><p>  In relation to the broader issue of creating the right environment for SMEs, I welcome the 2014  which aims to build on the significant progress which has occurred in job-creation since the first Action Plan was launched in February 2012, with 61,000 extra jobs added to the year-end 2013.

The public sector has an immense purchasing power, spending in the region of &euro;8.5 billion per annum on goods and services in addition to expenditure on public works.  This level of expenditure by the public sector affords significant business opportunities for firms that can supply the products and services that are required by public bodies. </p><p>  The Government is committed to reforming the public procurement process and has established an Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to drive a new consolidated and integrated approach to public procurement. The OGP is reviewing and updating the public procurement guidelines to reiterate that it is the Government intention that SMEs should be encourage to participate as fully as possible in the public procurement process. We will continue to support Irish companies seeking to participate in procurement contracts overseas; and encourage a wider approach to purchasing innovative solutions to meet public sector needs.</p></reply>

Since then the OPW has completed works on the tidal area of the river, with the exception of the raising of the bridge parapets at Lansdowne Road which is due to be undertaken in the coming months. Much work has also been undertaken in the fluvially affected areas (Phase 2C) up to Ballsbridge with this section of the scheme due to be completed later in 2014. </p><p>  Works to the area up to Anglesea Road (Phase 2D) are due to commence shortly and are due for completion by mid-2015. Further works upstream, (Phase 2E) towards Clonskeagh are expected to be completed before the end of 2015.</p><p>  The OPW has expended approximately &euro;13.677m up to the end of 2013 on these works, with a further &euro;1.5m approximately to be spent in 2014. The works completed to date provide protection in the tidal-risk area against a 200 year tidal flood event. It is notable that the storms in the first few weeks of the year, which caused so much damage countrywide, caused no flooding to those areas protected by the OPW works, despite the tides being the highest ever recorded in Dublin. </p><p>  The OPW has made provision in it's Multi-Annual Budget profiles up to 2016 for the completion of the works.</p><p>  The table sets out the expenditure in each year since 2006.<table><tr><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;0.27m</td><td>&euro;1.688m</td><td>&euro;2.196M</td><td>&euro;2.765M</td><td>&euro;1.529M</td><td>&euro;0.79M</td><td>&euro;2.149M</td><td>&euro;2.29M</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The plan will be based on a comprehensive study of Ireland's public investment priorities over that period. </td><td>Completed - (A new NDP was not undertaken but the five year Exchequer capital framework was laid out in &quot;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&quot; published in November 2011. A new five year framework will be set out as the period of the current framework comes to a close.)</td></tr><tr><td>In the initial years, when resources will be most heavily constrained, we will prioritise investment in school building, non-national roads, healthcare, and in job-creation. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will insist that major capital projects are subjected to proper cost-benefit analysis and evaluation, improving future productivity and growth prospects, and that the value-for-money obtained is significantly enhanced compared to the most recent period. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The new NDP will be based on traditional exchequer capital spending, plus other resources to be invested from the National Pension Reserve Fund, on the basis of obtaining a return on investment and that does not impact the Government Balance Sheet. </td><td>In Progress (no new NDP - see above   but there is a 5 year Exchequer framework and a new PPP programme)</td></tr><tr><td>In developing the new NDP, we will re-examine the investment programmes of the semi-state companies to ensure that they are in line with new economic circumstances. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>In order to ensure that public enterprise plays a full role in Ireland's economic recovery, we will create a holding company to manage the state's holdings of the semi-states, and to co-ordinate investment in key priority areas identified by the Government, including energy, water and forestry. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Over time, we also propose to finance the investment programme from the sale of certain state assets. We will target up to &euro;2 billion in sales of non-strategic state assets drawing from the recommendations of the McCarthy Review Group on State Assets when available. Assets will only be sold when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures have been established to protect consumer interests. </td><td>A programme of State assets disposals is in progress. </td></tr><tr><td>Re-prioritise capital funding for smaller projects that deal with specific immediate problems. Smaller projects are more labour intensive and more likely to be carried out by local contractors increasing short-run domestic economic impact. Investment priorities will include education, health and science and technology.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Conduct a Comprehensive Spending Review to examine all areas of public spending and to assess effectiveness of spending programmes and value for company.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Accelerate capital works that are 'shovel ready' and labour intensive including schools and secondary roads.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will reform public procurement to become a tool to support innovative Irish firms and to allow greater access to Irish small and medium sized businesses. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce new legislation to protect all small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>A referendum to amend the Constitution to reverse the effects of the Abbeylara judgement to enable Oireachtas committees to carry out full investigations.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>A referendum to protect the right of citizens to communicate in confidence with public representatives.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>All appointments at Principal Officer level and above will be open to external competition and at least one-third of such appointments will be reserved for candidates from outside traditional civil service structures for a 5-year period. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Pin down accountability for results at every level of the public service   from Ministers down   with clear consequences for success and failure. Ministers will be responsible for policy and procurement and public service managers for delivery.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Where appropriate, agency boards will be scrapped and agency managers will report directly to Ministers and their Departments on performance against targets. </td><td>Action Required</td></tr><tr><td>Put in place a Whistleblowers Act to protect public servants that expose maladministration by Ministers or others, and restore Freedom of Information. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>There will be no more &quot;golden handshakes&quot; for public servants that have failed to deliver. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Overhaul TLAC (Top level Appointments Commission), with the chairperson and the majority of members drawn from outside the public sector. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Introduce a reformed incentive system for all grades within core Government departments to reward cross-departmental teams that deliver audited improvements in service delivery and cost effectiveness. </td><td>Action required/Subject to Haddington Road Agreement</td></tr><tr><td>Go beyond the recommendations of An Bord Snip to rationalise core processes that are duplicated across the public service, by establishing shared back-office operations for information technology, human resource management, payments and entitlement applications, business inspections and procurement. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Review the Local Government Efficiency Review as part of our Comprehensive Spending Review.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Make substantial cuts to the number of State bodies and companies.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Instigate a Government-wide review to identify and eliminate non-priority programmes and outsource, where appropriate, non-critical functions. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Rather than giving fixed budgets to traditional public service providers like the HSE, VECs and F&Aacute;S, we will put resources into the hands of citizens to acquire services that are tailored to better suit their needs and less expensive for the taxpayer.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Establish a new model of financing social interventions   called Social Impact Bonds   that share audited exchequer savings with charitable and voluntary organisations.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Where appropriate we will open up the delivery of public services to a range of providers. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will give schools, hospitals and other public service bodies new freedoms   within strict budgets and new accountability systems   to set their own staffing needs, automate routine processes and adapt work practices to local staff and customer needs. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate for a reformulated code of laws, replacing both the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Public Service Management Act, which will spell out the legal relationship between Ministers and their civil servants and their legal accountability for decisions and for management of Departments.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>The system of implied general delegation of a Minister's statutory powers to civil servants will be abolished and replaced by a fixed and determined system of delegation of specified powers to specified officers. </td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>Where a responsibility is delegated through several civil service grades, each grade will be held accountable for their element of it and departmental officials giving evidence to Oireachtas committees will be obliged to speak on their own behalf for their delegated responsibilities and, where appropriate, defend themselves and their actions. </td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>Delegation orders will spell out the functions of the Minister in supervising the exercise of delegated powers: the Minister will be responsible for ensuring that adequate standards are maintained; outputs are delivered as determined or agreed; and procedures are in place to provide the Minister with the necessary and correct information to enable him or her to respond to problems of administration and to give an account of those problems, and of any necessary corrective action, to the D&aacute;il and to the public.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>We will bring to an end the unacceptable executive practice where no record is kept of ministerial involvement with an issue and resulting decisions.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will review the grading structure of the civil service and public service and reduce number of management grades.Public service managers will be given greater autonomy in deciding how they use staffing budgets and resources to achieve agreed outcomes. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will remove barriers to mobility across the public service. As part of this we will create a new tier of senior public service management structures, where senior officials are rotated across the public sector to nurture the collaborative culture needed to tackle the biggest cross-cutting social and economic challenges. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>High level strategic goals will be reflected in individual goals, in a new performance management and development system for staff. Staff recognition schemes will be developed and devolved, with particular emphasis on team awards. Staff will be encouraged to put forward suggestions for improving service delivery and organisation efficiency and effectiveness. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Government services websites, public offices, telephone services, and helplines will be reconfigured to facilitate access to a broad range of government services through a single point of contact. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Ministers' salaries will be reduced, political expenses vouched for and severance payments for ministers axed.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>No political pensions will be paid to sitting TDs and in future no retired politician will get a political pension until the national retirement age. Politics must be about service to the public, not financial gain for politicians.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Amend the Constitution to Give D&aacute;il committees Full Powers of Investigation: The Abbeylara Supreme Court decision currently limits the ability of D&aacute;il committees to hold investigations into crucial issues of public concern, such as the banking crisis.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>A statutory duty on anybody established by or under statute, or with a majority ownership or funding by the State, to submit to the same parliamentary questions regime as applies to Government departments. This will involve a liability to provide answers to written questions within a specified number of D&aacute;il sitting days. (We will however recognise the special position of bodies with a commercial mandate operating at arm's length from Government). </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will amend the rules to ensure that no senior public servant (including political appointees) or Minister can work in the private sector in any area involving a potential conflict of interest with their former area of public employment, until at least two years have elapsed after they have left the public service.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>Restrictions on the nature and extent of evidence by civil servants to Oireachtas committees will be scrapped and replaced with new guidelines for civil servants that reflect the reality of the authority delegated to them and their personal accountability for the way in which it is exercised.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>The Committee would be the formal channel of consultation and collaboration between the Oireachtas and the Ombudsman, responsible for receiving and debating her annual and special reports and for ensuring that her criticisms and recommendations are acted upon. For that purpose, she would attend as a regular witness before the committee.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate to restore the Freedom of Information Act to what it was before it was undermined by the outgoing Government, and we will extend its remit to other public bodies including the administrative side of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, subject to security exceptions</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We intend to end the heavy dependence on a very limited pool of extremely expensive private solicitors firms providing legal services to the State and agencies, look at ways to require agencies to seek legal advice from the CSSO and not from the private sector in order to save costs, and ensure that legal work at the bar for the State is spread more equitably rather than confined to a very limited pool as at present. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will progress the Statute Law Revision Project in order to enhance public accessibility to the statute book.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will extend Freedom of Information, and the Ombudsman Act, to ensure that all statutory bodies, and all bodies significantly funded from the public purse, are covered.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce Whistleblowers legislation.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a statutory register of lobbyists, and rules concerning the practice of lobbying.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will abolish the additional pay for Ministers who leave office. We will restrict the payment of pensions to politicians so that in future a member can only qualify for a pension at the national retirement age (currently 65) and upon leaving public life. We will cap taxpayers' subsidies for all future pension schemes for politicians (and indeed for everybody) that deliver income in retirement of more than &euro;60,000.</td><td>Part Complete/Part in Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate and change D&aacute;il standing orders to ensure the absolute confidentiality of information entrusted to members of the D&aacute;il by their constituents or informants, and ensure that such information cannot be compulsorily disclosed through the legal process except with the consent of the informant.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Every public body will set out clear and unambiguous long, medium and short term strategic priorities, which will be clearly communicated to public service and citizens. Strategic priorities will be translated into high level goals for all Departments, on a 'whole of government' basis, and in consultation with Ministers. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Performance indicators will be identified to monitor progress on high level priorities. Annual reports of departments and agencies will include output statements and audited financial accounts prepared on generally accepted accounting principles. The performance information provided in output and outcome-focused measurement will feed into the decision making process for future plans at political and senior management level. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The reform process will provide for increased delegation of budgets, subject to detailed plans, relevant performance reporting and audited accounts compiled in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Detailed business cases will be required for major projects, with review and reporting requirements built in to the plan. Sanctions will be imposed at an early stage for significant overruns. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will change the current emphasis on performance reporting to performance management. All medium to long-term projects that involve significant public spending will be subject to cost benefit analysis, and to on-going evaluation. The results of programme evaluations will be published and programmes not meeting their objectives will be wound down. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Performance and progress will be published in a new, audited annual Public Service Delivery Reports. Oireachtas Committees will expose any failure to hit milestones and targets. Each sectoral Committee will take on new powers, similar to those wielded by Public Accounts Committee, to hold Ministers and public servants to account for value for money. This will feed into Oireachtas consideration of the next Budget. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Where appropriate, agency boards will be scrapped and agency managers will be accountable directly to Ministers.</td><td>Action Required </td></tr><tr><td>We will bring forward the annual Estimates cycle, so that it becomes more timely and relevant. It will in future start at the beginning of the preceding year and conclude by the summer. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The annual Estimates will in future distinguish between monies being allocated to maintaining the existing level of service for existing programmes and money to support new programmes or policy decisions.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Book of Estimates will be accompanied by a detailed performance report on what the previous year's spending had achieved. It will also give details of the level of performance achieved by agencies under service delivery agreements with Government. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Oireachtas members will be given, from within existing resources, dedicated resources for the proper scrutiny of the Estimates. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will give the Comptroller and Auditor General the extra powers needed to carry out value-for-money audits of State programmes.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will publish cost-benefit analyses for major infrastructure proposals and &quot;tax expenditures&quot; in advance of Government approval. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Public sector bodies will be required to publish balance sheets and to move to accruals from cash-flow accounting. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Every Purchase Order by a Government Department or agency for more than &euro;20,000 will be published online. We will give the Comptroller and Auditor General and Oireachtas Committees the extra powers needed to carry out value-for-money audits of State programmes. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Public bodies will be required to openly compete for budget resources by publishing pre-budget spending requests, and what they would deliver in return for such allocations to help deliver Programme for Government. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will conduct a Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) to examine all areas of public spending, based on the Canadian model, and to develop multi-annual budget plans with a three-year time horizon. This plan will be presented to the D&aacute;il for debate. It will assess effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes, and value for money.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The CSR will examine the number, range and activities of bodies funded significantly from public purse, including at local government level, and reduce numbers where appropriate. In future, when proposing a new agency, it will be necessary to prove that the proposed new functions cannot be carried out within the existing framework. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>We will, subject to there being no compulsory redundancies and to the protection of front line services: Reduce the total number of public sector employees by between 18,000 and 21,000 by 2014, compared to the total number at the end of 2010. Reduce this number by a further 4,000 by 2015. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>We will extend the remit of Ombudsman to third level institutions.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Review existing tendering processes for legal services by Government and State and semi-State agencies to ensure value for money and end anti-competitive practices. </td><td><br /><br />In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>The Government directed that a robust analysis be carried out to evaluate how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte with Bord na Mona to create a streamlined and refocused commercial state company operating in the bio-energy and forestry sectors</td><td><br /><br />NewERA has been established based on the UK Shareholder Executive model (advising Ministers from shareholder perspective) rather than Holding Company model (where shares would transfer from Ministers to NewERA).</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td><br /><br />NewERA manages the shareholder function in relation to ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, EirGrid, Bord na Mona, and Coillte and provides specialist investment and financial advisory services to Ministers in relation to the corporate governance of these commercial State companies.</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td><br /><br />NewERA is also working with Departments to develop and implement proposals for investment projects in the NewERA sectors of energy, forestry, water and telecommunications.</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td><br /><br />An evaluation of how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na in nearing completion. </td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />-</td><td><br /><br />This is expected to be finalised shortly and will then be submitted to the relevant Ministers for their consideration.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

A further group of about 40 posts in that facility are unaffected.  In addition, a single operating unit at a separate plant in Swords, Co Dublin, will also cease manufacturing but the company will continue to employ about 330 at the Swords plant.  These job losses are very regrettable but I have asked IDA Ireland to work closely with the company in relation to the future of these sites. </p><p>  A total of &euro;3,660,565 of grants was paid to the company by the IDA since 2005.  In relation to meetings held, I myself met company executives in New York in February 2012.  IDA Ireland had 16 meetings with this company in 2013 and a further three meetings have been held to date in 2014.  These meetings were at corporate level to discuss their current operations and future opportunities in Ireland. </p><p>  The fact remains that the pharmaceutical sector is still a substantial employer in Ireland.  Unfortunately there are considerable global pressures facing that industry at present, including overcapacity, patent expiry, clinical trial failures and fallout from mergers and acquisitions.  This has resulted in various adverse decisions on employment in some Irish plants by various companies.  However you will appreciate that these decisions are made by the companies in what they see as being in the best interests of the groups as a whole and are designed to safeguard the remaining operations.  Despite these occasional setbacks, it is noteworthy that employment in IDA client companies in the pharmaceutical sector has been rising in recent years, despite the  various pressures.  Total employment at the end of last year was 25,180, up 5% on the previous year.</p><p>  Recent investment wins for Ireland in the Biopharma/Pharma sectors include Alexion, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, BioMarin, Regeneron, Abbvie and Eli Lilly.  IDA Ireland remains confident it can attract further fresh Pharma investment to Ireland during 2014.</p></reply>

In direct response to the demands of entrepreneurs and client companies, Enterprise Ireland has continued to introduce new initiatives to provide the right support at the right time, at all stages along the start-up journey.   From initial steps, developing the idea, testing the market, and on to raising HPSU funding, the priority is to support Irish entrepreneurs while they build strong and innovative new export businesses, and create jobs.</p><p>  The number of High potential and early stage start-ups that are funded is the culmination of a high level of engagement by Enterprise Ireland with entrepreneurs to build their business proposition. The target number of 155 high potential and early stage start-ups in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 was set in consultation with Enterprise Ireland, is a stretch level of activity and reflects Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s own internal targets. </p><p>  In 2014 Enterprise Ireland through its Competitive Start Fund is targeting three new sources of entrepreneurs:</p><p>  - Graduates;</p><p>  - Entrepreneurs focussed on the aviation sector; and</p><p>  - Entrepreneurs with ideas for new manufacturing technologies.</p><p>  It is challenging, in advance, to gauge the number of potential applicants in these areas and the number of high potential projects that will emerge as they are new areas of focus for Enterprise Ireland.  However, it is hoped that these will be a strong source of new entrepreneurs and additional high potential start-ups.</p><p>  In addition to this support Enterprise Ireland provides advice to 1,300 early stage entrepreneurs and works intensively with over 350 pre seed start-ups to help them to build an investor ready business plan. While Enterprise Ireland will strive to exceed the target of 155 this specific company support should be looked at in the context of the wider suite of direct and indirect supports provided by Enterprise Ireland for its client base.</p></reply>

This lets Enterprise Ireland gauge the standard of applications that can be brought forward to the national Student Enterprise Awards Programme and it also assists the Agency in promoting the national competition in the Third Level institutions.</p><p>  The Third Level Student Enterprise Awards Programme is an annual programme run across the island of Ireland jointly by Enterprise Ireland (EI) and Invest NI, utilising private sector sponsorship.  The programme is aimed at all Third Level colleges and seeks to encourage entrepreneurship amongst undergraduates.  Prizes to the value of &euro;60,000, via a combination of cash and mentoring, are awarded annually.  Approximately 400 applications are received each year from individual students and student teams. </p><p>  This academic year, Enterprise Ireland has increased the emphasis on identifying and nurturing Ireland&rsquo;s future entrepreneurs in Third Level colleges by presenting directly to students and academics about its national competition, sponsoring the internal competitions in the institutes, having a presence at Enterprise Weeks in the Third Level institutions, engaging with student unions and entrepreneurship societies, surveying previous finalists to see how EI could change the competition in the future to make it stronger, and finally, emphasising to students that starting their own business after graduation is a real career option for them.  </p><p>The competition is fully built around developing student teams into start-ups, especially with help and consultancy of the sponsors, such as Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI mentoring and funding packages, Cruickshank Intellectual Property Consultants who mentor the student teams around protecting and patenting their ideas, Intel help student teams develop ICT ideas and Grant Thornton help the teams with finance/accounting concerns they may have.   A marketing campaign, linked to a dedicated website - () - and new application formats (video and social media), have been introduced for this year&rsquo;s programme.

It is one of a number of supports provided by Enterprise Ireland to support the achievement of international sales. These supports complement Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s international office network, which has access to more than 60 countries worldwide, through which Enterprise Ireland can support Irish companies in the market place.</p><p>  This grant is designed to assist clients to develop viable marketing strategies in target markets. The Market Access Grant supports a client to undertake all the activities from initial market research to developing insights to the relevant market prior to a market launch. The client may receive funding in respect of:</p><p>  - New staff assigned to the project;</p><p>  - Staff re-assigned to the project;</p><p>  - Consultant(s) to undertake the project;</p><p>  - Marketing costs up to market launch     </p><p>  The grant is available only to companies:</p><p>  - Entering a new geographic market;</p><p>  - Entering an existing market with a new product/service </p><p>  The Market Access Grant was piloted to a small number of companies last year and the agreed target for 2014 stretches that level of activity and reflects Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s own internal targets for company capability development and export sales.  There is no doubt that Enterprise Ireland will strive to exceed this target however this specific company support should be looked at in the context of the wider suite of direct and indirect supports provided by Enterprise Ireland for its client base.  </p><p>  If Irish owned companies are to continue to achieve an increase in the diversity and quantum of Irish exports I believe that it is very important that companies are supported to undertake informed research to assess the potential of a new product or service in an existing market or an existing product or service in a new geographic market.</p></reply>

Foreign owned firms have a strong impact on the Irish economy by contributing substantially to Ireland&rsquo;s exports, jobs, expenditure in the Irish economy and to Exchequer funds.  IDA Ireland client companies are responsible for over 161,000 jobs and are a catalyst for an additional 100,000 jobs in the wider economy.  For every 10 jobs created in multinational companies approximately 7 jobs are created elsewhere in the economy in supply and service businesses. </p><p>  In addition to winning new name FDI for Ireland, IDA Ireland recognises the important role of the existing base of foreign owned firms as approximately 70% of FDI investments come from the existing client base.  A key aspect of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s focus is developing and deepening the impact of FDI through the organisation&rsquo;s Client Transformation Programme.  This involves wide-ranging engagement and influencing of senior management of existing FDI facilities in Ireland and with corporate leaders overseas, seeking to widen and deepen the mandate and functions of the Irish-based facilities.  To assist companies engage in a transformation programme, IDA Ireland offers a range of supports such as technology uplifts, skills enhancement, energy improvements, productivity uplift and investments in new facilities and equipment.  This is a vital activity as positive outcomes further embed existing investors, thus providing long term employment which is often in important regional locations as illustrated by recent transformation investments by Hewlett Packard in Galway and GSK (Stiefel) in Sligo. </p><p>  As per the Action Plan for Jobs, in 2014 IDA will support 70 companies in manufacturing and services through the above Client Transformation Programme.</p></reply>

For example, Ireland has moved up to 17th place in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook 2013, having being ranked 24th only two years ago.  Ireland is ranked 15th  in the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2014 Report and was recently named by Forbes magazine as the &ldquo;Best Country for Business&rdquo;.  </p><p>  However, we cannot become complacent about our competitive position; many firms are still confronted with high costs which make it difficult for them to grow, create jobs and compete internationally.  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, which was published at the end of February, places a particular focus on improving competitiveness in all areas of economic activity and contains a range of specific measures aimed at delivering further improvements in our international competitiveness performance.  These measures include regular monitoring of the competitiveness agenda by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs, which will report to the Government on a quarterly basis on these issues. </p><p>  The National Competitiveness Council (NCC), which is an independent body, also has a key role to play in monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and reports to the Government on key competitiveness issues facing Irish enterprises.</p><p>  Each year, the NCC publishes Ireland's Competitiveness Scorecard, which benchmarks Ireland's competitiveness performance against a number of our key competitor regions.  The Council also publishes Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge which focuses on the competitiveness issues of most importance to the enterprise sector.  The report also identifies policy recommendations required to address these issues. </p><p>  Action 92 in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs refers to the publication of the Competitiveness Challenge.  This report is scheduled to be published in the final Quarter of the year.  However, the NCC meets regularly throughout the year to consider the competitiveness agenda and develop its reports. It is supported in its work by Forf&aacute;s.</p><p>  Other measures in the Action Plan for Jobs include improving our cost competitiveness, supporting competitive regions, aligning skills with enterprise needs and using research and innovation to drive job creation. </p><p>  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government&rsquo;s exit from the Troika programme and its return to international funding markets, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness further and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.   </p></reply>

In this way Irish companies can leverage the wealth of experience, skills and resources in the higher education system in a cost effective and even cost-free way depending on the most appropriate support.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s collaborative supports are scaled and tailored to meet the varying needs of industry and range from small &euro;5,000 Innovation Voucher projects to larger Innovation Partnership projects which can provide support of up to &euro;200,000.  Enterprise Ireland also plays a critical role in helping Irish companies and researchers engage in international research under the European Union&rsquo;s almost &euro;80 billion Horizon 2020 programme. </p><p>  The 2014 target of 825 supported collaborative research projects between industry and academia was set by Enterprise Ireland based on its experience of working with industry and in supporting collaborative research, and also in cognisance of the expected levels of demand from industry and the capacity of the research system to undertake the number of projects.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it is not possible to provide a comparison of the number of persons with zero-hours contracts in 2014 vis-&agrave;-vis the number of persons with zero-hours contracts in 2010.</p><p>  Zero-hours contracts are covered by contract law.  I note that these contracts must be entered into freely by the employer and the employee &ndash; one cannot be forced upon an employee.  Zero-hours contracts are normally found in sectors such as retail, health care and hospitality.  In certain circumstances, they may be of great benefit to both employers and employees.  Such contracts may be preferred by employees who require flexibility to facilitate educational or other personal requirements, and banning such contracts could do a disservice to these workers.  </p><p>  It is important to note that section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 contains a specific protection for employees who are employed on zero-hours contracts.  The zero-hours protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  It covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he/she was requested to work or to be available to work, the zero-hours provisions of the Act ensure that he/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he/she is required to be available, or 15 hours, whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  Claims of breaches of section 18 may be referred to a Rights Commissioner.</p><p>  An expectation of work does not, however, entitle an employee to compensation.  The zero-hours provision does not apply to lay-offs, short-time, emergency or exceptional circumstances, employee illness, employee on-call or where the employee is paid wages for making him/herself available for work.</p><p>  Sections 17 and 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act may also be of particular interest to employees on zero-hour contracts.  Section 17 sets out the requirements regarding notification to the employee of the times at which he/she will be required to work during the week, and Section 19 sets out an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to paid annual leave calculated based on hours worked.</p><p>  However, this is an area I will keep under review.</p></reply>

Dublin is now fast emerging as one of Europe&rsquo;s major hubs for data centre services and cloud computing infrastructure.  Since January 2010, significant data centre investments have been secured for Ireland from companies such as Google, Microsoft, Digital Reality Trust, Amazon, Betfair, Telecity Group and Adobe. </p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains and losses in client companies of the enterprise development agencies.  However, as information is supplied by companies on a confidential basis for statistical purposes only, it is not possible to isolate data centre job numbers from the Survey.  Data centres by their very nature are utility intensive and create little direct employment.  Typically, data centres employ small numbers of people when operational.  Though the jobs numbers are low, these jobs are generally well paid, in the region of &euro;75K per annum, and provide secure employment for a considerable period of time.</p><p>  Data centres are a highly capital intensive investment and as such provide a significant economic impact during the construction phase both from a spend and employment perspective.  A major benefit of data centres, as a form of inward investment, is the fact that they tend to have long life spans.  Data centres are typically designed to last 12-15 years and since they need local power and communications infrastructure to be available, they are location dependent.  For this reason, data centres can remain on the same site for 20-30 years, making them a long term investment.</p><p>  In recognition of the potential for Ireland to capitalise on and secure significant investments in this sector and associated areas, the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs introduced a Disruptive Reform with the overall ambition to &ldquo;build on existing enterprise strengths to make Ireland a leading country in Europe in the area of Big Data and Data Analytics.  Among the key initiatives progressed in 2013 were:</p><p>  - The establishment of a Taskforce on Big Data and Data Analytics with a mapping of infrastructure and initiatives supporting Big Data and Data Analytics in Ireland and the identification of pilot projects to demonstrate the impact of Big Data and Data Analytics;</p><p>- The launch of Insight, the SFI‐supported research centre for data analytics involving a &euro;88 million investment by Government and industry and the launch by Enterprise Ireland; and</p><p>   IDA Ireland of the CEADAR Technology Centre in data analytics:</p><p>  - Preparations for Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Open Government Partnership including a commitment to a number of actions in the area of &ldquo;open data&rdquo;;</p><p>  - Support for a number of courses targeting the area of data analytics particularly under the Call for ICT Conversion Courses in 2013 and the completion by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s of a study of skills demand in Big Data and Data Analytics.</p><p>  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs builds on these 2013 initiatives and investments and will help to give Ireland a leadership position in a number of specific aspects of Big Data and Data Analytics.</p></reply>

Goods exports to the country increased by 55% from &euro;445 million to &euro;690 million between 2009 and 2013.  This pace of growth, in the context of a very difficult global trading environment, suggests that, in the future, Mexico has the potential to become a very important market for Irish exporters.  In the Government Review of the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy 2010 &ndash; 2015, published last month, Mexico has been designated as an exploratory and high potential market. </p><p>  In this context Mexico is an attractive developing market for a number of the client companies of Enterprise Ireland.  These opportunities are very sector specific and the agency is working, one to one, with companies to develop business in their areas of interest.</p><p>  To underpin this work, it is planned to have a Trade Mission to Mexico in October this year.  It is intended that a range of companies in the areas of ICT, Financial Software, Education and the Oil and Gas industry will participate.  Enterprise Ireland is at an early stage of planning for this trade mission and will finalise arrangements over the next 6 months.  </p><p>  In October 2013, President Higgins visited Mexico, El Salvador and Costa Rica.  To coincide with his visit to Mexico, Enterprise Ireland held a business breakfast in Mexico City which was attended by 130 key business contacts including H.E. Mr Carlos Garcia de Alba, Ambassador of Mexico to Ireland.</p><p>  A Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Mexico was implemented in 2000 for trade in goods and expanded in 2001 to cover trade in services.  Discussions are underway on a possible modernisation of this agreement and a Joint Working Group on Trade and Investment has been set up to discuss how this might be implemented.  While any proposal to formally open new trade talks with Mexico is some time away, I would welcome an expansion of economic and trade links that will support the development work already underway by Enterprise Ireland to increase the potential of the Mexican market for our exports.</p></reply>

Priority is given to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, and any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from the provision of assistance to a proposed enterprise is also taken into account.</p><p>  When the CEBs are dissolved, the exchequer funding allocation will be delivered by the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) within Local Authorities and overseen by Enterprise Ireland.  Budgets will be allocated on an annual basis under the existing Measure 1, Measure 2 and administration (pay and non-pay) headings.  The funding will be monitored using the agreed Service Level Agreement (SLA) between Enterprise Ireland and each Local Authority.  In accordance with the SLA, the LEOs will provide services under four headings, namely, Business Information and Advisory Services, Enterprise Support Services, Entrepreneurship Support Services and Local Enterprise Development Services.  The on-going drawdown of budgets by LEOs will be contingent on reaching agreed targets.  There are no immediate plans to change budget methodology, grant eligibility, or grant assistance rates.</p><p>  The Exchequer allocation, as secured by my Department, will continue to be the primary source of funding for the LEOs.  A total of &euro;29.4m has been allocated for the CEBs/LEOs in 2014 and this includes an additional &euro;3.5m which will be primarily targeted at a new initiative focussed on youth entrepreneurship and young people with a business idea who wish to start their own business. </p><p>  In addition to financial supports, this fundamental reform aims to ensure that other State supports to enterprise are properly promoted and targeted.  The LEOs will be the  <b>First Stop Shop</b> for micro and small businesses for the range of supports available.  The combination of the restructuring of enterprise supports and additional Exchequer funding will result in the enhancement of the support service to the sector in a variety of ways including the development of Protocols relating to information and guidance, mutual contacts, and client referrals to other key agencies such as the Department of Social Protection, Revenue, Microfinance Ireland, Skillnets, etc.</p><p>  In short, the LEOs will engage with all business ideas with the objective of providing information, guidance or support (financial and non-financial), as appropriate.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is self-evident that a family with more child dependents, for example, or with caring requirements, will receive more than a family with none and so on. </p><p>  In some cases, families receive larger volumes of supplementary payments and therefore have a higher level of welfare income.  This is usually because one or more family members require caring or have a disability, in which case the Department of Social Protection provides extra supports to assist the families in question.</p><p>  It should be noted that, as regards people of working age receiving welfare payments, the vast majority of those on the Live Register receive only a single personal weekly payment of &euro;188 or less and no additional benefits of any kind.  Those individuals therefore have a very strong incentive to work. </p><p>  In a small percentage of cases where a disincentive to work does exist, I am overseeing extensive reforms to remove such disincentives and assist people back to work and towards financial independence.  For example, the Department is working with the Department of the Environment to introduce Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), to replace Rent Supplement.  HAP will subsidise rent for people on welfare and in low-income employment so that they will not lose housing assistance when they move from welfare to work. </p><p>  In addition, the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare is currently progressing its final module of work on the issue of working age income supports and the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems.  The aim of the Group&rsquo;s work is to determine how the social welfare system can best achieve its goals of supporting persons through periods of involuntary unemployment while also incentivising work and disincentivising welfare dependency. </p></reply>

The Programme is managed on behalf of the Department by Pobal.  </p><p>  The CSP is designed on a social enterprise model and a core requirement of the programme is that contract holders generate non-public revenue from their operations e.g. by charging fees for services delivered or fundraising.  The grant from the Department is not intended to represent full-funding. Companies in contract under the CSP are responsible for their own budgets, income, financial and other liabilities and must be not-for-profit, social enterprise or community business in nature.</p><p>  A re-contracting process for a number of the approved organisations took place in 2013, including the project referred to by the Deputy.  This involved the submission of business plans which were reviewed by Pobal.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  A person who is in receipt of rent supplement who commences the back to work enterprise allowance may retain entitlement to rent supplement, subject to the means test, if they are deemed as eligible for the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) by a housing authority. The back to work enterprise allowance scheme is designed to encourage people who are dependent on certain social welfare payments to engage in self-employment while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years. </p><p>  A new applicant for rent supplement who is participating on the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme would not qualify for rent supplement.

Amongst other things, these regulations allow those who wish to go to another EU country to look for employment to continue to receive their unemployment benefits for up to 3 months. While the regulations provide that Member States may extend this period to six months, Ireland does not operate this further concession.</p><p>  As part of a series of measures to encourage and facilitate free movement of EU citizens across the Union, the EU Commission has proposed that the export period should be standardised at six months.  Legislation to effect this change has not yet been formerly proposed by the EU Commission but it is expected that this will happen later this year.</p><p>  It is important that unemployed people are assisted in their efforts to secure employment and in this regard the facility to export benefits is an important support for those who wish to look for a job in another EU country. However, I am not convinced that allowing export of benefits for an extra three months will improve the prospects of a person seeking employment abroad. Therefore, I will examine any forthcoming proposal that extends this period on a mandatory basis very carefully.</p></reply>

In a small number of cases, a second means test may be required if they apply for basic supplementary welfare allowance or rent supplement.  </p><p>  In 2010, DSP commenced work on a project to build an application to allow the capture and storage of means data for customers across 13 different means-tested schemes. The resulting application is known as the Means Assessment Object (MAO).  The Department has now completed a further project to enhance the Means Assessment Object.  This project has extended the functionality of the system in order to facilitate the capture of means data for a number of contributory-based schemes for the purposes of determining entitlements to additional allowances (e.g. Increases for a Qualified Adult or a Qualified Child) which have a means testing element.  </p><p>  Now that the functionality for the relevant schemes to use the MAO is in place, roll-out of the application will be undertaken to the additional business and scheme areas involved.  The overall effect of this development is to ensure that once means data is captured in the MAO it is available for re-use by other scheme areas, thereby eliminating the need to provide similar information a second or subsequent time.</p><p>  A second project, the Means Information Sharing Service (MISS), will provide the capability to allow for the electronic sharing and re-use of means element data as stored by DSP within the MAO with participating State bodies. Exchanges of data will relate solely to information on means and will assist participating bodies in providing a better service to customers, by reducing the number of times customers would be required to provide information on their means where possible entitlements are being assessed.  This project has now developed a web service which is due to go into live use with one State organisation shortly.  The feedback from this live test will inform the further development and roll-out of the service.</p></reply>

The purpose of the after-school child care (ASCC) scheme is to help to offset some of the after-school child care costs that are associated with availing of an employment opportunity in a bid to encourage more individuals to take up employment.  The scheme supports those who are unemployed as well as one-parent family payment (OFP) recipients.    The ASCC scheme is available nationwide since 31 October, 2013 and will provide 800 subsidised after-school child care places in 2014.</p><p>  Following Budget 2014 the Childcare Employment and Training Support (CETS) Programme was expanded from 1 January, 2014 to include Community Employment (CE) participants. There are 1,800 places available nationally. Access to the CETS Programme for CE participants means they can now access subsidised child care for the first time in the same way as participants pursuing Education and Training Boards courses. Feedback from CE sponsors is that the lack of access to affordable child care is a barrier to participation on CE for parents with young children, particularly lone parents.  This measure is an important provision in their engagement. Lone parents currently on CE and those in receipt of the OFP prior to commencement on CE are particularly welcome to take up a CETS subsidised childcare place. </p><p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has responsibility for the wider provision of childcare and any further childcare measures planned would be a matter for that Department.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-25a.1112.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032500074#WRW01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 523, 536, 540, 569 and 570 together.</p><p>  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.   Following an extensive review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in some areas including Dublin. The fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement, of which almost 30,000 are in the Dublin area, shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants on the scheme. </p><p>  A breakdown of rent supplement expenditure in Dublin by postal code is not available. Rent supplement recipients in Dublin each year since 2007 is provided in the attached tabular statement. Rent supplement recipients in Dublin 2, 4, 6, 6W and 8 at end 2012 and 2013 are also provided, however this information is not available for earlier years. The maximum rent limits in operation in Dublin since 2007 are also provided.</p><p>  All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties, particularly in Dublin. Increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve this difficulty, due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students. The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients and is working closely with Dublin City Council and Threshold to ensure that the necessary arrangements can be put in place in respect of vulnerable families in receipt of rent supplement. </p><p>  Department officials administering rent supplement have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs. </p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. </p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process. </p><p>  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has a minimum income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution of &euro;30 for a single person or &euro;40 for a couple. Where a person has an additional income above the rate of SWA they are, in certain circumstances, required to top up their rent. </p><p>  The tenant, landlord or landlord&rsquo;s agent must complete the rent supplement application form declaring that the information provided is accurate. The form clearly states that making a false statement or withholding information may lead to prosecution. </p><p>  The Department, in June 2012, introduced powers of enquiry for staff to formally request and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and tenancy.  </p><p>  Any instance of false declarations of the amount of rent payable should be reported to the relevant Department representatives who have specific legislative powers to deal with such offences. In such cases the Department&rsquo;s representative will discuss the circumstances of the case with the tenant before making any decision in relation to ongoing entitlement. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities. Payments will be made direct to landlords under the HAP scheme. Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, to pilot HAP in Limerick local authority in early 2014 with further roll out to selected local authorities during the year.</p><p><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement Recipients in Dublin</b>.   <b></b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Recipients</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>20,498</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>24,119</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>31,261</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>33,818</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>34,425</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32,584</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>29,541</td></tr></table><b>Table 2: Rent Supplement recipients in Dublin 2, 4, 6 and 8</b><table><tr><th>~</th><th>End 2012</th><th>End 2013</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin 2</td><td>246</td><td>201</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 4</td><td>349</td><td>265</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 6</td><td>1,752</td><td>1,436</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 6W</td><td>403</td><td>320</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 8</td><td>2,422</td><td>2,225</td></tr></table><b>Table 3:</b><b>Maximum Monthly Rent Levels in Dublin since 2007</b><table><tr><th>Maximum <br /><br />Rent Levels</th><th>Dublin</th><th>Dublin </th><th>Dublin Fingal</th><th>Dublin <br /><br />Not Fingal</th><th>Dublin Fingal</th><th>Dublin <br /><br />Not Fingal</th><th>Dublin Fingal</th><th>Dublin <br /><br />Not Fingal</th></tr><tr><td>Single Shared</td><td>425</td><td>399</td><td>350</td><td>390</td><td>250</td><td>300</td><td>300</td><td>350</td></tr><tr><td>Couple Shared</td><td>425</td><td>399</td><td>390</td><td>400</td><td>330</td><td>370</td><td>350</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>Single </td><td>563</td><td>529</td><td>529</td><td>529</td><td>475</td><td>475</td><td>520</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td>Couple</td><td>867</td><td>806</td><td>770</td><td>800</td><td>650</td><td>700</td><td>700</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>Couple/One Parent Family -<br /><br /> 1 Child</td><td>1,000</td><td>930</td><td>930</td><td>930</td><td>775</td><td>875</td><td>850</td><td>950</td></tr><tr><td>Couple/One Parent Family -<br /><br /> 2 Children</td><td>1,200</td><td>1,110</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,050</td><td>825</td><td>925</td><td>900</td><td>975</td></tr><tr><td>Couple/One Parent Family - <br /><br />3 Children</td><td>1,200</td><td>1,110</td><td>1,050</td><td>1,100</td><td>900</td><td>950</td><td>950</td><td>1,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-25a.1135.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032500074#WRW03200"><p>Section 10 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 requires my department to commission an actuarial review of the position of the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) at 5-year intervals.  The third Actuarial Review of the SIF was published in 2012 and covers the period to 2066.  Projections in respect of the State pension (contributory) are as follows:<table><tr><th> -</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2030</th><th>2040</th><th>2050</th><th>2060</th><th>2066</th></tr><tr><td>State Pension (contributory)(&euro; Billion)</td><td>4.783</td><td>5.172</td><td>5.584</td><td>6.012</td><td>6.486</td><td>6.927</td><td>11.009</td><td>17.956</td><td>26.746</td><td>33.233</td><td>36.562</td></tr></table>  These projections were made on a &lsquo;no policy change&rsquo; basis.</p><p>  The increase in State pension contributory expenditure reflects changing demographics with older people living longer.  The number of State pension contributory recipients at the end of 2013 was 329,531 and this number is increasing by approximately 17,000 each year.  </p><p>  State pension (non-contributory) is a means tested payment, funded directly from the Exchequer, rather than the SIF and there are no corresponding projections.  As a consequence, in addition to the variables such as demographic change, it is also impacted by other pressures such as: social Insurance coverage (increases in this result in higher numbers qualifying for the contributory pension, thereby reducing the number of non-contributory pensioners); private pension coverage (again, increased coverage would be expected to reduce pressures on the non-contributory pension); general economic trends, which are likely to increase or decrease the means available to those over 66, thereby impacting on the numbers who qualify for non-contributory pensions.</p><p>  The widening of the applicability of PRSI in recent decades has seen a small downward trend in the non-contributory pension.  In 2009, the cost of this payment amounted to &euro;1.0 billion, whereas by 2012 this had declined to &euro;963 million (96,129 recipients), and this reduction is expected to continue as the numbers qualifying for the contributory pension increases. It is, of course, significantly less than the corresponding increase in the State pension (contributory).</p><p>  The increase in the expenditure projected for the contributory pension would be expected to increase future shortfalls in the SIF, and in time become unsustainable without pension reform. In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, a number of significant reforms to State pensions have recently been introduced as follows: the standardisation of State pension age to age 66 began in 2014.  While the current State pension age of 66 remains, the State pension (transition) which applies for one year for persons of age 65 has ceased from 1st   January 2014; State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028; with effect from April 2012, and as provided for in legislation in 1997, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions; as provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced. These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions; as announced in Budget 2012, the period for which a claim for State pension can be backdated is six months. This change came into effect in April 2012.</p><p>  Following considerable policy analysis, it is planned to introduce a &lsquo;total contribution approach&rsquo;. The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change.</p></reply>

Legislation states that, where it is shown to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that adequate provision has been made for the care of the care recipient, the carer may engage in employment outside the home for duration not exceeding 15 hours per week.

The allowance is intended as a contribution to a person&rsquo;s heating costs.

It is possible to receive both the fuel allowance and the household benefits package giving customers &euro;940 per annum towards their energy costs.  </p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, Departmental staff  have some discretion in issuing exceptional needs payments to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet within their own resources; this may include exceptional heating costs.  This discretion must be exercised in a reasonable way, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  In 2013, &euro;1.2 million was issued for exceptional needs payments related to electricity and gas bills.</p><p>  In addition, over 2,200 customers received a special heating supplement, paid to assist people with special heating needs because of ill health or infirmity.  </p><p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term,   as noted in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Affordability Strategy, is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.</p></reply>

A couple who wish to marry must attend a registrar&rsquo;s office and notify the registrar of their intention to marry in writing. Both parties to the marriage are required to provide evidence as to their identities, civil status, age and nationality.  If either party was born outside of the State, a birth certificate bearing an apostille stamp from the country of birth is required.  This step is necessary to help ensure that the intended marriage is not for unlawful purposes. The requirement is also crucial in combatting the presentation of false documents to registrars.</p><p>  The Department recognises that the requirement for an apostille stamp on a birth certificate for people born outside the State may result in added costs and extended turnaround times.

Moreover, the scheme&rsquo;s objectives are of a social character and the benefits involved are targeted at individual consumers.  The mechanism used to deliver those social character benefits to passengers requires participation by transport undertakings.  Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 of 21 April 2004 mentioned by the deputy, refers to changes in State aid and is therefore not applicable in the context of a scheme which does not constitute State aid.</p><p>  It is the clear understanding of successive Irish Governments that the free travel scheme is compatible with Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).  In this regard:</p><p>  a) Undertakings participating in the free travel scheme have a clearly defined responsibility to provide free travel to beneficiaries of the scheme whereas non-participants have no such obligation; </p><p>  b) Compensation under the scheme is calculated in advance on the basis of fares foregone at a reduced rate to take account of travel generated by the free travel scheme. The objective is that compensation payable should not exceed what is necessary having regard to the costs incurred;</p><p>  c) Those operators which participate in the scheme receive a payment significantly below the standard fare whereas those operators which do not participate in the scheme are free to charge the full fare for all passengers.  </p><p>  As the free travel scheme is not intended to provide a profit to operators, payment under the scheme is not an &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; in State aids terms but merely compensation for the additional costs incurred.  For these reasons the free travel scheme is not considered to be incompatible with Article 107. It pursues a social objective of the type identified in Article 107(2) (a) TFEU. </p><p>  In any event, the scheme has been in operation since 1967, before Ireland joined the European Communities in 1973.  Therefore, even if the scheme did amount to State aid (which, of course, is not accepted by successive Irish Governments) it would be &ldquo;existing&rdquo; aid under Articles 17-19 of Regulation 659/1999.  The question of informing the EU Commission does not therefore arise.</p><p>  The contractual arrangements in place with participating transport operators, including CI&Eacute; companies, are on the basis of agreements set out in exchange of letters, rather than a formal contract.  This practice is not uncommon, and indeed is used by the EU itself.  Participating companies are obliged to accept passengers in possession of a valid free travel pass.  There have been no changes to this obligation since 1997.  The Department carries out surveys to ensure that companies meet their obligations.</p><p>  Last year a letter was issued to all transport operators participating in the free travel scheme prior to the launch of the Department&rsquo;s public services card incorporating the free travel variant.  This letter required them to submit the following documentation: </p><p>  1. Current Tax Clearance Certificate; </p><p>  2. A National/International Road Passenger Transport Operator&rsquo;s Licence as issued by the Department of Transport;</p><p>  3. Regular service Licence as issued by the National Transport Authority  for all  bus routes in the Free Travel Scheme;</p><p>  4. PSV licences in respect of each of the buses on which they carry free travel pass holders;</p><p>  5. Motor insurance policies which indemnified the Minister for Social Protection against any claims, causes or actions arising out of any accident involving free travel pass holders while embarking, travelling on or disembarking from their buses;</p><p>  6. A Public Liability Insurance Certificate;</p><p>  7. Fares structure/s and timetables.</p><p>  Companies were reminded of their requirement to notify the Department of any change in the level of service which they provide, ensuring at least one month's prior written notification of their intention to cease or modify their bus operations on any route.  On foot of this, a range of operators across the State were inspected on the ground by Department officials.  To ensure that the service as agreed is available, each operator was communicated with for confirmation (by signed declaration) of routes and timetables as agreed with the Department.  Any operator found in the course of the inspection not  complying fully with the terms of their agreement, will be inspected further and action will be taken to stop their payments and recover any overpayment from when they actually ceased to operate a particular route.</p></reply>

In some instances customers call into their local office to submit a claim, while in others claims are made by post or online.  For example, applications for State Contributory Pension are proactively initiated by the Department where there is a known entitlement, with the customer given a unique key to enable them to go online to complete their application.  In the case of jobseekers assistance and jobseekers benefit these claims are made in person at the customer&rsquo;s local office with no transfer of files required except in the case of an appeal.  In addition, it should be noted that the Departments systems are set up to make information accessible throughout the Departments network, thereby greatly reducing the need to transfer files or applications.</p><p>  It is not departmental policy under data protection  to send customer files by e-mail.

Her supplementary welfare allowance appeal was registered on 3 March 2014.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought from the Department of Social Protection.  These papers have now been received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office and both appeals have been referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeals based on documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-25a.1205.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032500077#WRZ01800"><p>I was very pleased to sign a multi-year contract with An Post for the delivery of over the counter cash services to welfare clients in December last year following an EU-wide procurement competition.  This contract, which is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact, enables the disbursement of cash payments to some nine hundred thousand (900,000) clients currently.  These services are provided through a network of over 1,300 post offices and agencies around the country.</p><p>  Last year approximately &euro;9.5 billion was paid in cash to our clients at post offices.  This accounted for 43.7 million transactions and cost the Department just under &euro;75 million (including internal processing costs). By comparison, some 37 million payments were issued directly into accounts in financial institutions by electronic funds transfer (EFT) and cost the Department under &euro;9 million.  In short, cash payments are an inherently more expensive means of paying clients.  The differential reflects to a large part the additional costs incurred in securely packing, processing, transporting, delivering and issuing cash to clients. The Department must address such a significant variation in costs in the interests of the economy, taxpayers and welfare clients.</p><p>  Mindful of the scope, scale and impact of these payments, the Department undertook a root and branch examination of its payment processes, methods and approaches.  This resulted in the preparation of a Payment Strategy which was approved by the Government last year.  The Strategy has the goal of reducing significantly the level at which welfare payments are made in cash and thereby minimising the associated expensive fees.  This is in keeping with wider Government policies and changes in consumer preferences.  It is based on the objective of better public services and more effective e-payments as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan and the eGovernment Strategy 2012-2015.  It is also aligned to the objectives of the National Payments Plan, which highlighted that the move to electronic payments is critical to reducing the very high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy with its consequential impacts on costs and competitiveness.  The Strategy aims to remove the limits that cash payments impose on clients in terms of making onward financial transactions and availing of cheaper prices online.</p><p>  We are all aware of the clear trend towards electronic payments which are being adopted by consumers generally as a matter of choice.  These behavioural choices are very apparent among the Department&rsquo;s clients also.  Two out of every three clients who claimed a contributory state pension last year chose to have it paid into an account.  Four out of every five new child benefit clients chose to be paid electronically into an account.  The Department is willing to accommodate its clients in exercising the choice of electronic payments where this is possible in the interests of economy, efficiency and national competitiveness.</p></reply>

I would point out to the Deputy that the information sought in the Parliamentary Questions referred to was not the same and, accordingly, there were significant differences in the details supplied in the answers and the total amounts of money referred to therein.</p><p>  The major difference is that Parliamentary Question No. 304 (PQ 6461/14) of 11 February 2014 asked me to provide details in relation to contracts awarded since May 2011. Parliamentary Question No. 115 (PQ 12586/14) of 13 March 2014 requested details of payments made since February 2011. The responses provided were responses appropriate to the details sought.</p><p>Some of the apparent difference also relates to the specific request in the first PQ for the full value of certain contracts, i.e. those put in place since May 2011, compared to the request for amounts paid in a given period, i.e. since February 2011, in the second PQ.</p><p>  In addition, there are a number of recipients listed on PQ 12586/14 that are not included on PQ 6461/14 as the relevant contracts were awarded prior to May 2011.  For example, the contract value for the General Register Office (GRO) maintenance &amp;amp; development project awarded in 2010, and the contract value for SDM (Service Delivery Modernisation) support and maintenance awarded in 2008 are not included in PQ 6461/14.  However payments made since February 2011 in relation to these contracts totalling some &euro;11 million are included in PQ 12586/14.  Full details of the constituent elements of the two responses are included in the following tables.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the engagement of consultants and external service providers contributes to decision making and policy formulation, and provides valuable support for the Department&rsquo;s service delivery modernisation and reform programmes, and that procurement of consultants and external service providers is compliant with best practice in procurement, governance and realising value for money.<table><tr><th> Contractor</th><th></th><th>Amount Spent 2011-end Jan 2014</th><th></th><th>Contract Value for contracts awarded post May 2011</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>GRO Maintenance &amp;amp;

The scale of this reform is challenging and wide-reaching. I am committed to working with the Department and its agencies in the delivery of the commitments in this Programme for Government and substantial progress on many of the commitments has already been made.  The third Annual Report which sets out the implementation status of my Department&rsquo;s main achievements in the Programme for Government was published by the Department of the Taoiseach in March 2014 and is available on </p><p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to publish the fourth Annual Report in March 2015 which will set out specific progress during 2014.  The timeline for the delivery of my Department&rsquo;s commitments for Programme for Government is over the lifetime of the Government.  The progress summary on the implementation of the commitments relevant to my Department is outlined in the following table.</p><p><b><i>Current update as of March 2014</i></b></p><p><b>Commitments in the Programme for Government for which the Department of Social Protection has a primary role</b><table><tr><th>Commitment </th><th>Status Summary at March 2014</th></tr><tr><td>Halve the lower 8.5% rate of PRSI up to end 2013 on jobs paying up to &euro;356 per week &ndash; announced in the Jobs Initiative.</td><td>Implemented.</td></tr><tr><td>Expand eligibility for the back to education allowance.</td><td>Implementation options under consideration and new initiatives are being piloted in 2013/2014.</td></tr><tr><td>The development of a new graduate and apprentice internship scheme, work placement programmes and further education opportunities for our young unemployed providing an additional 60,000 places across a range of schemes and initiatives &ndash; announced in the Jobs Initiative.</td><td>Implementation in progress.</td></tr><tr><td>Replacing F&Aacute;S with a new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES) so that all employment and benefit support services will be integrated in a single delivery unit managed by the Department of Social Protection. This integrated service would provide a &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; for people seeking to establish their benefit entitlements; looking for a job; and seeking advice about their training options.</td><td>Implementation underway, including roll out of Intreo.</td></tr><tr><td>The NEES will process citizen entitlements such as supplementary welfare allowances, higher education grants and welfare allowances. It will manage as much as possible means testing for State entitlements. It will also be responsible for employment referral and training supports provided by F&Aacute;S. This service will offer users a higher level of personalised employment counselling, with more frequent face-to-face interviews. Those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment will receive priority treatment for more intensive support. It will ensure active case management for people in need of assistance.</td><td>Implementation underway, including roll out of Intreo.</td></tr><tr><td>Maintain the standard 10.75% rate of employers PRSI.</td><td>Implemented.</td></tr><tr><td>Introduce a range of measures to tackle the problem of welfare fraud.</td><td>A range of measures have been implemented under the Fraud Initiative 2011-2013. Further progress will be made in the context of a new anti-fraud strategy which is being developed. </td></tr><tr><td>Establish a Tax and Social Welfare Commission to examine entitlements of self employed and the elimination of disincentives to employment.<br /><br /><br />The Commission will examine the interaction between the taxation and the welfare systems to ensure that work is worthwhile. In particular, it will examine family and child income supports, and a means by which self-employed people can be insured against unemployment and sickness</td><td>Implemented.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare has completed and reported on three modules:<br /><br /><br />- Child and family income supports<br /><br />- Budget 2012 proposals relating to  <br /><br />  Disability Allowance and  <br /><br />  Domiciliary Care Allowance<br /><br />- Extending Social Insurance <br /><br />  coverage for the self employed<br /><br /><br />The Advisory Group is currently progressing its final module of work on the issue of working age income supports. </td></tr><tr><td>Convert the Money Advice and Budgeting Service into a strengthened Personal Debt Management Agency with strong legal powers.</td><td>The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 provides for three new non-judicial debt resolution processes; the Debt Relief Notice (DRN), the Debt Settlement Arrangement and the Personal Insolvency Arrangement. <br /><br /><br />At the request of the Minister, the Citizens Information Board (CIB) agreed that MABS would act as Approved Intermediaries for the purposes of processing DRNs.  The CIB together with MABS have worked closely with the Insolvency Service of Ireland to ensure that the appropriate structures are in place within MABS to meet the challenge of delivering this new service. <br /><br /><br />An Approved Intermediary Service (AIS) has been established for the purposes of processing DRNs.<br /><br /><br />To date, 31 MABS companies are included on the Insolvency Service of Ireland register of Approved Intermediaries. </td></tr><tr><td>Make greater use of Mortgage Interest Supplement to support families who cannot meet their mortgage payments. </td><td>Budget 2014 provided for the closure of Mortgage Interest Supplement for new applicants from 1 January 2014 and a wind down of the scheme over a four year period. <br /><br /><br />In line with the Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those experiencing mortgage difficulties, the underlying principle of this measure recognises that the most appropriate way in which customers can be supported is through engagement with their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) which will provide sustainable and durable resolution options.  </td></tr><tr><td>Maintain Social Welfare rates.</td><td>Implemented.</td></tr><tr><td>Committed to achieving the targets in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion to reduce the number of people experiencing poverty.<br /><br /><br /></td><td>Implementation of the National Social Target for Poverty Reduction continues to be rolled out in 2014. <br /><br /><br />A Social Inclusion Report covering progress on implementation of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion during the years 2011-2012 was completed in 2013. <br /><br /><br />Under Pathways to Work, a report is being prepared to examine the factors influencing the level of jobless households and to develop a range of recommendations to allow Government to take additional tangible steps in 2014 to assist these households to return to work. </td></tr><tr><td>We will examine the social protection system with a view to identifying and eliminating poverty traps including;-<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Amending the 30 hour rule for Rent Supplement and Mortgage Interest Supplement for people moving from welfare to work.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Activating people on a reduced week who refuse extra day(s) employment.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Over time, One Parent Family Payment will be replaced with a parental allowance that does not discourage marriage, cohabitation or work.<br /><br /><br />Our tax, social welfare and other laws should not discourage people from getting married or cohabiting. For example, single mothers lose the One Parent Family Payment if they marry. Over time, we will transform it into a family income-based payment that does not discourage marriage or work.</td><td>Conditions which may give rise to the development of poverty traps are analysed on an ongoing basis.<br /><br /><br />The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities. One of the key benefits that HAP will bring is the removal of barriers for people currently in receipt of rent supplement in returning to employment. <br /><br /><br />Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department, Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing the necessary legal, policy and operational requirements to give effect to this transfer and to pilot HAP in early 2014.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sanctions currently exist whereby a person who refuses employment or additional employment may be subject to a disallowance.  In addition, issues in relation to short-time and casual workers were referred to the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in 2013. The outcome of group deliberations will inform Departmental policy in 2014.<br /><br /><br />Changes to the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) are currently being implemented on a phased basis to 2015. The purpose of these changes is to move the scheme much closer to the jobseeker schemes, tackle the high levels of lone parents suffering from consistent poverty and to improve outcomes for lone parents and their families.</td></tr><tr><td>A zero tolerance approach to welfare fraud, underpinned by a major anti-fraud enforcement drive.</td><td>Progressed under the Fraud Initiative 2011-2013. Further progress will be made in the context of a new anti-fraud strategy which is being developed.</td></tr><tr><td>As well as more regular face-to-face interviews with an integrated employment and entitlements service for those of working age, other anti-fraud measures will be undertaken using latest available technology and better sharing of data across government departments and agencies.</td><td>Continuing to build key relationships and consult and share data with external agencies, where appropriate.<br /><br /><br />Progressed the use of predictive analytics to more effectively target cases for review.</td></tr><tr><td>Progressively reduce reliance on Rent Supplement, with eligible recipients moving to the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</td><td>At end December 2013, there were approx. 80,000 rent supplement recipients with approx. 50,000 in payment for more than 18 months. Details of these cases are notified on a quarterly basis to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG).<br /><br /><br />At the end of December 2013 a total of 47,911 households had been transferred from Rent Supplement (RS) by local authorities. Of these 28,338 were housed directly under RAS and a further 19,573 were accommodated under other social housing options.<br /><br /><br />The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) as approved by Government, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities. </td></tr><tr><td>Review the operation of the Rent Supplement Scheme and introduce a code of conduct for rent supplement eligibility similar to that which operates for local authority tenants.</td><td>Implementation in progress in co-operation with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. <br /><br /><br />The purpose of this review is to ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the Rent Supplement Scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants. <br /><br /><br />The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals through the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  The Department is currently working with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to achieving this goal.</td></tr><tr><td>Pay rent supplement to tax-compliant landlords registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) and offering decent quality accommodation, to root out fraud.</td><td>Since January 2011, it is a requirement that the landlord&rsquo;s tax reference number must be supplied to the Department prior to award of a rent supplement claim.  <br /><br /><br />The Department continues to provide the Revenue Commissioners with details of all rent supplement payments on an annual basis to ensure this sector is tax compliant. The Department also continues to work closely with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to help ensure that rent supplement tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.</td></tr><tr><td>Divert staff from elsewhere in public service to clear the social welfare appeals backlog, and introduce a consolidated appeals process.</td><td>Implemented.</td></tr><tr><td>Put the household benefits packages out to tender, so that the Exchequer benefits from reduced prices.</td><td>Implementation not feasible based on advice from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Competition Authority as the Department is not the actual customer.  <br /><br /><br />Negotiations took place with the major utility providers which resulted in improved deals and yielded savings. </td></tr><tr><td>Raise the issue of payment of Child Benefit in respect of non-resident children at EU level, and seek to have the entitlement modified to reflect the cost of living where a child is resident. We will examine all possible flexibility within European legislation to reduce the cost of this payment.</td><td>Issue has been raised with the current EU Commissioner who is not willing to propose the legislation necessary. Therefore, it is unlikely progress can be made. Ireland is continuing to engage with other countries interested in this area and is participating in a group on Fair Free Movement which is trying to develop options which can be discussed with the EU Commission.</td></tr><tr><td>Ensure that trans-gender people will have legal recognition and extend the protections of the equality legislation to them.</td><td>The General Scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill was published in July 2013 and referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee (JOC) on Education and Social Protection. The JOC held a public consultation and hearings in October 2013 on the General Scheme and published its report in January 2014.<br /><br /><br /><br />Following Government consideration of the report, the General Scheme of the Bill will be referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting with the aim of the legislation being published later in 2014.</td></tr><tr><td>Reform the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers, to achieve better risk sharing, and to provide for greater flexibility for those who wish to retire on a phased basis.</td><td>A number of measures have been implemented and further measures are under consideration.<br /><br /><br />The Minister recently informed the Dail of her intention to introduce a scheme to improve pensions coverage once the economy is in a more sustainable position. In this regard, the Minister is observing the developments in other countries with some interest. <br /><br /><br />Analysis of the recommendations outlined in the OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System, published in 2013, is on-going and will inform further developments in the area of long-term pension policy.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector such as the Free Travel Pass and the Social Services Card (SSC) of this Department and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers.</p><p>  Approx. 615,000 PSCs have been produced to date. These include c.126,000 Free Travel variants.  PSCs are produced by a managed service provider, Biometric Card Services Limited, at a facility in Bray, Co. Wicklow.  The Department&rsquo;s Card Management Section deals with enquiries from customers who report that their PSC or SSC did not work at the nominated Post Office.  In general, there are three reasons why swiping a card in the Post Office may fail to work, including, a record for the cardholder does not exist on the An Post file, the magnetic stripe becomes faulty over time (e.g. scratched, proximity to other magnetic stripes, wear and tear etc.) or the card reader is faulty.</p><p>  To date, of the total number of PSCs issued, only 310 have been returned by customers as &ldquo;not working&rdquo;.  However, 87 of these functioned correctly when subsequently tested by Card Management Section. The remaining 223 (0.04% of all cards produced) did not work when tested.  These included cards that were faulty and cards that were damaged.  In all cases, the returned PSC was revoked and the person issued with a new one.  It is evident from these figures that there is almost a negligible level of faulty cards.  The Department endeavours to ensure that cards issued are of the highest quality, and as part of this ongoing quality control, An Post recently tested a sample of live cards in three separate locations and all read successfully without any failure. Additionally, a number of these cards were swiped over 100 times each and no failures were recorded.</p></reply>

The amount payable depends on an assessment of the parent&rsquo;s weekly means. In assessing means, account is taken of all cash income which the person is receiving, including maintenance payments.  Currently, earnings from employment or income from self-employment up to &euro;90 per week are disregarded in the assessment of means, with the balance assessed at 50%.  This means that people earning up to &euro;90 per week are entitled to the full rate of payment.  Other disregards which are offset from the gross earnings are PRSA/AVC contributions, superannuation, pension levy, PRSI and trade union subscriptions.  No payment is due where weekly earnings exceed &euro;425, regardless of family size.</p><p>  In the assessment of maintenance, housing costs up to &euro;95.23 per week are disregarded, with the balance assessed at 50%.  As a result of this approach, a recipient will always retain at least half of any maintenance paid.  On the basis of the information supplied by the Deputy, there may be entitlement to a reduced rate of one-parent family payment.  Where a person is working a minimum of 19 hours each week, there may also be an entitlement to family income supplement (FIS), which is based on net weekly income (including any social welfare payment) and the number of children in the family.  The current weekly income threshold for a two child family, above which no FIS is payable, is &euro;602.  If the Deputy wishes to forward me further details of the case, the Department will be in a position to provide a more detailed reply.  Alternatively, the person can make enquires at his or her local Intreo Centre.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that a public consultation was undertaken by Waterways Ireland on the proposed bye-laws governing Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and the Barrow system and this concluded on 3 February 2014. The proposed new bye-laws provide for the management of house boats, extended moorings and residential moorings. They will also modernise the charging regime which has remained unchanged for almost a quarter of a century.</p><p>  I am advised that Waterways Ireland received over 2,000 submissions in the course of the by-law consultation process.  Waterways Ireland is now giving full and careful consideration to all of these submissions and I am advised by Waterways Ireland that some of the submissions touch on the issues outlined in the correspondence that accompanied the Deputy's Question.  In particular, all proposed fees and charges are currently being examined by Waterways Ireland in the context of the submissions arising from the recent public consultation process.</p><p>  Waterways Ireland will then prepare a report setting out its proposed approach, including any revisions it may wish to make to its original proposals, having regard to all of the submissions received including those relating to the proposed fees. The report will be submitted to my Department and will then be referred to me, with recommendations for consideration and final decision.  As previously indicated, I will afford interested Deputies and Senators an opportunity to discuss the proposals with me prior to making the final decision.</p></reply>

These final designs have now been submitted to my Department and I will, therefore, be happy to meet with the relatives in the coming period.  I understand that a date for the proposed inspection of the national monument on behalf of the 1916 relatives has been agreed by the owners.</p><p>  The requirement for the submission of an Environmental Impact Statement as part of the consent application arose in this case as a consequence of new statutory requirements I introduced on 9 July 2012 in accordance with EU Directive 2011/92/EU.  The consent applicant was asked to submit the required Environmental Impact Statement on 10 July 2012.  My Department provides an advisory service in relation to compliance with the statutory requirements under codes of legislation relating to monuments and archaeology, the built heritage, and nature and wildlife protection. In this regard, five informal meetings took place between my Department and the applicants and their representatives between July 2012 and the submission of the Environmental Impact Statement in January 2013.</p><p>  In relation to No. 18 Moore Street, the Deputy will appreciate that my functions, as Minister, relate to ensuring that any works to that building do not adversely impact on the adjacent national monument.  The Preservation Order was made on the grounds that the protection of No. 16 is of national importance by reason of its historical significance as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising.  To achieve that objective, the Order also covers Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and includes the yards to the rear of Nos. 15 and 16 Moore Street, extending to Nos. 8 and 9 Moore Lane. The position regarding the area outside of the monument is set out in the planning permissions granted by Dublin City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-25a.1273.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032500079#WRBB00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 590 and 591 together. </p><p>  Our waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.  There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland.  As the Deputy is aware, Waterways Ireland has prepared draft bye-laws in respect of the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and the Barrow Navigation. These proposed bye-laws were the subject of a statutory public consultation process earlier this year. </p><p>  The proposed bye-laws are intended to support the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals. They will enhance Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s ability to manage, care for and maintain the canals and to help to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users including those that use the canals for residential purposes, and will help create and develop the canals into a waterways system that is modern and fit for purpose. </p><p>  There have been no changes to the bye-laws for over 24 years. There are areas of canal use which have developed in that time in an unregulated manner such as the use of the canals by people living permanently on their boats.  Under the existing bye-laws there is no provision of this type of use. A further problem is the permanent mooring of privately owned boats in key village and harbour locations which is deterring touring boat traffic as there is no access to be able to moor and visit, spend money, eat in local restaurants, etc in such locations.</p><p>  Active control of how boats use the canals is vital if they are to flourish for boating use and there has been exaggeration of for example the change to the charging regime.  New bye-laws are necessary to ensure the proper management and control of these nationally important recreational assets.  </p><p>  The draft bye-laws propose that the cost of the annual extended canals mooring permit would range from &euro;160 to &euro;1,600 in most cases, depending on the size of boat, location and services provided.  In the Grand Canal Dock in Dublin, the proposed cost of the extended mooring permit is &euro;2,500 per annum.</p><p>  The proposed bye-laws also provide for the management of house boats, defined as a boat on the canals which is being used as the sole or principal residence of the owner or an occupant with the owner's permission.  The proposed fee for the houseboat mooring permit, where these are provided, will range from &euro;1,250 to &euro;3,500 per annum, again depending on the locations and services provided. </p><p>  I am advised that Waterways Ireland received over 2,000 submissions in the course of the bye-law consultation process.  Waterways Ireland is now giving full and careful consideration to all of these submissions, following which it will prepare a report setting out its proposed approach, including any revisions it may wish to make to its original proposals. The report will be submitted to my Department and will then be referred to me, with recommendations for consideration and final decision.  As I indicated previously, I will afford interested Deputies and Senators an opportunity to discuss the proposals with me prior to making the final decision.</p><p>  I am informed by Waterways Ireland that over 50 extended mooring locations have been identified, mapped and published on the Waterways Ireland website.  Following the making of new bye-laws, Waterways Ireland's valuation staff will develop the proposed annual mooring charges for each of the mooring locations already identified and for any other locations that may be identified in the meantime.</p></reply>

Two civil servants (1.4 whole time equivalent) at clerical officer grade are engaged in my constituency office. The combined annual rate of pay for these officers, both of whom are paid at standard civil service rates, currently amounts to &euro;49,079.   Overtime and expenses, where they arise, are payable at standard civil service rates. I can confirm that no such costs occurred in respect of these officers in 2013 or to date in 2014.</p><p>  As both officers are located in my Department's headquarters, no additional accommodation costs arise in respect of their assignment to constituency work.  As I have previously advised the House, I have also appointed a personal secretary and a personal assistant, based in my constituency office in Listowel, in line with the above mentioned guidelines.</p></reply>

In the case of the arts, funding decisions, including bursaries, are a matter for the Arts Council.   In general terms, responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts. Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, and I have no role to play in relation to its funding decisions.</p></reply>

I understand that there were over 2,000 submissions made in the course of the public consultation process, all of which were submitted directly to Waterways Ireland as the body responsible for conducting the consultation process.  Waterways Ireland is now giving full and careful consideration to all of these submissions, following which it will prepare a report setting out its proposed approach, including any revisions it may wish to make to its original proposals. The report will be submitted to my Department and will then be referred to me, with recommendations for consideration and final decision.  As I indicated previously, I will afford interested Deputies and Senators an opportunity to discuss the proposals with me prior to making the final decision.</p><p>  The canals are normally open for navigation from April to October.  As the Deputy will be aware, the economic downturn has led to a decline in resources available in recent years.  Waterways Ireland, in common with other public bodies, has not been immune from the impact of this decline.  In this context, I am informed that Waterways Ireland is actively considering targeting its limited resources and manned services to the times of greatest use and benefit across all its navigations.</p><p>  The proposed bye-laws are intended to support the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the Grand and Royal Canals and the Barrow system. There will be a new free one month Visitor Permit which seeks to actively encourage boats to visit and tour on the canals.  The proposed bye-laws also seek to address the issue of boats on the canals remaining permanently moored in key locations such as villages, which are then inaccessible to boats visiting the canals and cruising along them.</p><p>  Overall, the proposed bye-laws will enable Waterways Ireland to develop the canals as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users and will help create and develop them into a waterways system that is modern and fit for purpose.</p></reply>

In that regard, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published Programme for Government Annual Report which sets out key areas of progress over the last 12 months. I also wish to draw his attention to recent D&aacute;il statements where I set out progress to date across the various commitments which fall within my area of responsibility and also key priorities for 2014.   For example, progress in the arts area includes the development of a series of commemorative projects for the Decade of Centenaries programme focussing in particular on the 2013-2016 period.  &euro;6m in total will be allocated in 2014 to a number of Departments including my own to fund a number of these commemorative projects.  In addition, a new Cultural and Heritage Centre is being established in partnership with Bank of Ireland at Parliament Buildings in College Green. A programme of exhibitions and events to be held here will be developed as part of the Decade of Centenaries.</p><p>  Progress has also been made in the encouragement of a culture of philantrophy in the Arts sector through the introduction of targeted initiatives in my Department.</p><p>  In the heritage area, the Review of Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) was published in January 2014 setting out significant reconfiguration of Ireland's NHA raised bog network to meet conservation targets.  Turf cutting will continue on 45 NHAs while cutting on a further 36 NHAs will be phased out over three years and 25 new, mainly State owned, sites will be proposed for designation to replace the habitats lost through de-designation of the more heavily cut sites.</p><p>  In the Irish language area, a progress report on the implementation of the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish language was published in July 2013.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta continues to drive economic development in the Gaeltacht. Its client companies created 616 new full-time jobs in 2013 with a further 560 expected as a result of projects already approved. &Uacute;dar&aacute;s client companies employ over 7,650 people, both full-time and part-time, and contribute over &euro;400 million in the form of direct expenditure in the Irish economy.  Good progress was also made on the commitment to review current investment and funding programmes that benefit Irish language organisations. Foras na Gaeilge announced new funding arrangements last year to support the development of the Irish language in both jurisdictions.  Six lead organisations were selected to specialise in six major areas of activity.</p><p>  I am satisfied that significant progress has been made so far across the range of commitments in the Programme for Government relating to my areas of responsibility and I look forward to building on that progress over the remaining two years of the Government's mandate.</p></reply>

The Review has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured NHA network. This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain NHAs by 2017, the designation of further NHAs and the partial or complete de-designation of certain NHAs.</p><p>  The bog to which the Deputy refers is one of the NHAs that has been signaled for complete de-designation and this will be done in due course. As a result of the review, the existing arrangements for domestic turf cutters on this bog will continue pending de-designation. My Department has written to all property holders who could be identified on the bog to inform them of the results of the Review. In addition, notices outlining the outcome of the Review have also been placed in local papers. </p><p>  It should also be noted, however, that separate legislative requirements also continue apply to large-scale turf-extraction, including, where relevant, requirements for planning permission and EPA licensing.</p></reply>

It is intended to catalyse action among small business owners to invest in the online trading aspect of their business. The scheme will provide individual qualifying businesses with a voucher of up to &euro;2,500 to be used with the company&rsquo;s own matching funding for the implementation of a trading online component to their business. The scheme is targeted at those small and micro enterprises (with less than ten employees and whose annual turnover is less than &euro;2m), who do not have an online presence or at those who are seeking to improve their online offering by adding, or improving, a trading online dimension.  &euro;5 million has been provided for the voucher scheme in 2014 in my Department's Vote<font color="#1F497D">.</font>   Planning is currently underway for the national rollout of the scheme which follows the completion of a pilot phase in the Dublin area. Under the pilot, 50 businesses were awarded vouchers in a competitive process which was oversubscribed. The successful companies were selected based on their project plan which included expected growth in jobs and exports. The pilot attracted businesses across a whole spectrum of activity including retail, wholesale, product and service providers. </p><p>  My Department is working closely with the County and City Enterprise Board network (soon to be Local Enterprise Offices) and Enterprise Ireland on the national scheme. Preparations are being scaled up and it is planned that vouchers will be made available initially in Dublin city and county, Cork city and county, Waterford city and county, Kerry and Louth and will then move to national rollout during the summer. </p><p>When launched, the voucher scheme will be advertised nationally and on the National Digital Strategy web page of my Department's website. It is envisaged that up to 2,000 small businesses will benefit from this initiative from mid-2014. The eligibility criteria that operated in the case of the pilot are available on the Dublin City Enterprise Board web page at    and it is likely that very similar criteria will apply in relation to the national scheme. </p><p>I have also made arrangements for companies who feel that they may be eligible, and would like to be informed when the scheme is being rolled out, to contact my Department at  with their name and contact details and my officials will notify them when the national scheme is open for applications.   </p></reply>

Now in operation for over 18 years, the LIEN engages over 160 of the largest energy users in on-going relationships, including site visits, through workshops and seminars, special working groups, networking clusters, and annual energy performance reporting. LIEN members share information on energy-saving technologies and techniques to maximise savings and maintain competitiveness. Energy spend across the LIEN is approximately &euro;870 million and now represents 17% of National Total Primary Energy Requirement (TPER). LIEN members recorded savings of 580GWh in 2012 which equates to a &euro;40 million saving.   The Energy Agreements Programme comprises approximately half of the LIEN membership and supports large industry to implement an energy-management system through the new ISO 50001 standard. Consistent annual savings across the Network averages between 2% and 3% per annum. Cumulative savings of in excess of 28% have been achieved to date.</p><p>  The SEAI&rsquo;s focus continues to be on promoting energy efficiency and associated cost reduction programmes through the small business support centre. During 2013, close to 300 organisations availed of the Advice Mentoring and Assessments (AMA) and/or EnergyMap training with a further 300 engaging in networking events, seminars, master classes and awards, collectively resulting in energy savings to SMEs of &euro;2.6 million. Annual savings of over 10% are being generated by the participating businesses year on year. </p><p>  Following the commitment in the Programme for Government and NEEAP, my Department has developed the National Energy Services Framework to help develop the energy-efficiency market in the non-domestic sector throughout Ireland. The Framework provides an integrated resource to both businesses and public bodies to help them become more energy efficient. The key to the success of the Framework will be the ability to identify and build a pool of investment grade projects. The first tranche of exemplar energy efficiency projects was launched in June 2013. Collectively, the exemplar projects will see investments of up to &euro;55 million in energy saving measures, resulting in annual energy cost savings of &euro;7 million. A total of &euro;480,000 in technical assistance has so far been committed across the initial 21 exemplar projects.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. The regulation of the industry, including regulatory issues surrounding speeds, is a matter for ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg&rsquo;s website at   , as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.</p><p>  The legislation to enable the ESB become a player in the telecommunications market has now successfully passed through all stages of the legislative process. This will allow ESB, either alone or in partnership with another operator, to engage in the provision of broadband services in competition with other existing market players. I would again reiterate that such involvement is purely on a commercial basis.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4 m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100 Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120 Mbps and 200 Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. </p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the roll-out of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.</p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

An environmental impact assessment, which requires public consultation as well as consultation with prescribed bodies, entails consideration of the potential impacts of a project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors. Under the EIA Directive, it is not possible to permit a project unless it can be determined following assessment that it would not have an unacceptable environmental or social impact.</p><p>  In this context, in December of last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a call for tenders to engage the relevant expertise to carry out scientific research into the potential impacts of hydraulic fracking. As part of the development of this process, the terms of reference for this study were the subject of a public consultation process and the submissions received were considered in finalising the procurment documents advertised. It is expected that a report from this study will not be published before 2016. </p><p>  I wish to confirm that no applications have been made to my Department to date proposing the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling. Furthermore, until there has been time to consider the findings of the EPA research, the use of this technology in Ireland will not be authorised.</p></reply>

The potential for investment, jobs and growth, are among the matters under consideration. In parallel with the CBA my Department is also developing a Renewable Energy Export Policy and Development Framework. I have stated on a number of occasions that transparency in the development of the framework is crucial and that the views of local communities must be at the heart of the transition to renewable energy. The Stage 1 consultation on the framework, which involved the publication of Stage 1 information and summary documents, ran late last year, and gave all interested parties an opportunity, at the outset, to present their views on how the Government should develop national policy to realise the opportunity to trade renewable energy with other EU Member States including the United Kingdom. The process is moving to Stage 2 with the publication of the scoping report for public consultation in the coming weeks. National press advertisements and updates on my Department's website will inform all stakeholders of the commencement of the Stage 2 consultation.    During Stage 3 the draft policy, the Environmental Report (on which the Strategic Environmental Assessment will be based) and Natura Impact Statement (on which the Appropriate Assessment will be based) will all be published and a public consultation will provide all stakeholders a further opportunity to contribute to make observations on the development of the framework. </p><p>  Discussions with the UK on a proposed IGA are continuing.

It will involve extensive work throughout the country, including building 800km of new transmission and upgrading 2,000 km of existing lines. </p><p>  Grid25 will reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels by putting the infrastructure in place to enable us use our own natural resources, help us create less carbon waste and enable us to reach our 40% targets for the generation of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. It will also provide capacity to facilitate regional economic development, together with jobs creation and growth, alongside the development of renewable energy sources. It will allow for long term growth in the demand for electricity and ensure the efficient operation of the All Island Single Electricity Market.</p><p>  The Government does not direct EirGrid to particular sites, routes or technologies. However, the July 2012 &ldquo;Government Statement on Transmission and other Electricity Infrastructure&rdquo; does require EirGrid to take account of all relevant national and international standards, and to follow best practice and ensure value for money. Decisions on both siting and technologies for energy infrastructure are matters for the developers and for the forward planning process, through regional and local development plans and at project level through the development management process.</p><p>  The issue of how the various projects under the Grid 25 Strategy will be financed, and the breakdown of associated expenditure by the company on public relations, consultancy and advertising are all matters for EirGrid and not matters in which I have a function. However, in relation to network investment costs, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) undertakes reviews of such costs incurred by both EirGrid and ESB every five years with additional monitoring carried out annually. The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that the significant network investment needed is efficient and delivered at the lowest possible cost to electricity consumers, while also ensuring that the grid investment necessary to enable greater fuel diversity (i.e. renewables) and security of supply is achieved.</p></reply>

At Budget time, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform factored a total of &euro;110m into the Estimates for 2014 in respect of projects supported from the sale of State assets. &euro;45m of this will fund part of the advance works associated with the new PPP Programme.

The confirmation indicated that there had been a substantial number of fish in the cages affected by this weather event.</p><p>  An assessment of the number of escapee fish involved is a matter for the Department of Agriculture Food and Marine and confirmation is awaited. </p><p>  IFI were not advised of any other potential escapes.</p><p>  Taking action for the recovery of escaped salmon from an aquaculture facility is dependent on several key issues:</p><p>1.  Immediate notification of the escape occurring - preferably within 24 hours as set out in licence conditions;</p><p>2.  Early mobilisation of personnel and assets in the particular area;</p><p>3.  Favourable sea conditions to ensure the recovery operation is safe. The presence of other cages and mooring ropes etc. in the vicinity of an aquaculture facility can make working conditions hazardous;</p><p>4. Wide dispersal of escapee fish - once an escape occurs fish can disperse very quickly and within a very short time it<font color="#FF0000"> </font>would be virtually impossible to recover in any significant numbers.   Depending on the time escapee fish have been loose, they can spread out to sea or enter local rivers. In such cases IFI&rsquo;s primary concerns are that escapee salmon enter wild salmon rivers and attempt to spawn either in the year of escape or possibly the following year due to the potential impact of weakening wild stocks which are genetically unique to each river. The success of recovery operations have always been dependant on the factors outlined above.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in the setting of gas or electricity prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated parts of these markets. Since 4 April 2011, prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated and business and domestic customers may avail of competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies. Price setting by ESB's Electric Ireland and all other electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for those companies operating in that retail market.   Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, and the small size of the Irish market. The wholesale price of gas is the most significant factor in the case of Ireland for electricity and gas. This has risen steadily since 2009 driven by events such as those in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan.</p><p>  ESB&rsquo;s profit after tax and before exceptional items was &euro;415m in 2013. This was an increase on the previous year due to a number of factors including payroll savings of &euro;51m and a higher energy margin of &euro;60m, of which two thirds relates to the regulated network business.</p><p>  In October 2013, ESB announced a price increase from 1 January 2014 by Electric Ireland in order to absorb the additional costs arising from higher fuel and network charges. The increase was also intended to absorb the cost of the increase in the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy which was approved by the CER to take effect from 1 October 2013. ESB stated at the time of its announcement that the company was conscious of the cost pressures being faced by its customers and the aim was to keep increases to customers as low as possible for as long as possible. However, costs are increasing due to factors outside Electric Ireland&rsquo;s control.</p><p>  It is worth noting that ESB paid an interim dividend of &euro;68.4m to the State in addition to a special dividend of &euro;161m in January 2014 out of proceeds from the sale of overseas generation assets in 2013. The Board has recommended a final dividend payment of &euro;28.8m, bringing total dividends for 2013 to &euro;258m and to &euro;1.2billion over the past ten years. I would also highlight that ESB contributes substantially to the Irish economy every year through dividends, investments, taxes and jobs. ESB provides significant employment both directly, with 7,500 employees, and indirectly through contractors and service providers.</p></reply>

I have no direct statutory function in relation to liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, including the Shannon LNG project. </p><p>  Decisions on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors and tariffing are statutorily matters for the CER under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. The CER as the independent energy regulator has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness. The CER also has a duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers. </p><p>  I and Government colleagues have consistently been supportive of the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a LNG terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry. The LNG facility would bring connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market. The prospect of such a facility is therefore a potentially positive step for the island of Ireland. While neither I nor my Department have any direct role in regard to the project, I have met with principals of the companies proposing to develop the project.</p><p>  Tariff reform is being driven by the entry of Corrib gas into the system. The rationale for the CER&rsquo;s high level decision of 29 June 2012 as regards pricing and treatment of the interconnectors is that if the current regime were to persist, and with new sources of gas such as Corrib gas and Shannon LNG, the price of gas would rise significantly for all Irish consumers, regardless of the source of the supply. Given our high dependence on gas for electricity generation this would also give rise to electricity price increases and would negatively impact on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. Full details of the CER&rsquo;s rationale for its decision are to be found in the CER Decision Paper of 29 June 2012 (CER/12/087) available from the CER website at   .</p><p>  The CER decision subsequently became the subject of a Judicial Review taken by Shannon LNG. On 11 December 2013, the High Court upheld the CER decision of 29 June 2012 on reform of the gas tariffing regime. I understand that Shannon LNG has appealed the High Court decision to the Supreme Court.</p><p>  The CER for its part is currently progressing the detail of tariff settlement as envisaged in the June 2012 decision and has recently notified stakeholders of the establishment of a Networks Tariff Liaison Group, which will include a representative from Shannon LNG. It has also advised stakeholders as regards the consultation process and its intention to finalise a Decision over the summer months. Therefore, it is in the interests of all stakeholders, including consumers, that clarity in regard to tariffing arrangements is provided as soon as possible and I would urge all concerned to engage with the CER on this regulatory issue.</p></reply>

The legislative framework governing inland fisheries is extensive, but quite dated. While the principal instrument is the 1959 Inland Fisheries Act, there are a myriad of other provisions. I made clear some time ago my intention to work to bring forward a legislative code fit for the twenty-first Century and have been working on this with my Department.  Modernising the legislative code in this area presents a unique opportunity to create a new and better way to manage the resource. In that regard, I have always sought to obtain a wide and meaningful engagement with all stakeholders in an open and transparent process and in this regard I organised and attended a series of public information and consultation meetings. The 70 proposals and submissions received on foot of the consultation process are published on the Department&rsquo;s website. While there is a wide range of views I am committed to listening to views from all sides. </p><p>  I want to again make it absolutely clear that no rod licence was proposed, nor is it intended to introduce such a licence. I have been absolutely clear and consistent on this point. </p><p>  I recently had a number of very positive and helpful meetings with angling representatives and I am happy that all of the Federations are in active discussion on the important issue of what the new legislation might include. There is a real opportunity for the angling community to work together in a positive and mutually respectful way in order to secure a bright future for the sector. I want to convey my support for the important discussions between the Federations and to reiterate my commitment that no legislative proposals will be advanced by me until the discussions are complete and I have heard the broad consensus on the new legislation. </p><p>  I welcome all proposals for developing the angling sector in Ireland. In this regard, it is intended that further comprehensive stakeholder consultation will also take place prior to any finalisation of the proposed Inland Fisheries Bill. </p><p>  I am keenly aware that not all anglers are members of clubs or federations and would urge all Deputies to encourage such anglers in their areas to participate in the future round of consultative meetings.  </p></reply>

The State does not become involved in the provision of services unless there is evidence of clear market failure.The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is one such example of State intervention. This scheme was designed to provide basic broadband connectivity to largely rural areas of the country that were not in receipt of commercial services.   Between the significant on-going commercial investments and the targeted State interventions basic broadband services are now available throughout the country. In these circumstances, I see no need to extend the Universal Service Obligation for landline telephony to cover broadband services. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. In addition, the recent enactment of legislation to facilitate the ESB's entry into the telecommunications market, either alone or in partnership with another operator, will contribute to the roll-out of high speed broadband and facilitate further competition in the Irish market.</p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.</p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

Membership of the group included members of the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA), the Housing Practitioner Network, Local Authority housing personnel and officials from my Department. Consultations were held with organisations working with older people and people with a disability, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, ALONE, HSE, Ataxia Ireland, the Irish Society for Autism and the National Disability Authority. The aim of the review was to spread the benefits of the schemes as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in their operation.   </p><p>  There has been no change to the maximum grant available under the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, which remains at &euro;30,000, or the Mobility Aids Grant, which remains at &euro;6,000. In the case of the Housing Aid for Older People, the maximum grant has been reduced from &euro;10,500 to &euro;8,000. It should be noted that the average grant paid under this scheme in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was &euro;4,162, &euro;4,106 and &euro;3,995, respectively, well below the maximum available. The age limit for eligibility has been increased from 60 to 66 years; however, a lower age limit may apply at the discretion of the local authority in certain cases.</p><p>  Changes have also been made with regard to the assessment of means of applicants. To bring it into line with the means assessment for applicants for social housing, all household members&rsquo; income, with certain exceptions, will be included in the assessment of means. The level of income beyond which no grant is payable has been reduced from &euro;65,000 to &euro;60,000. In the case of an applicant where a household member is aged under 65 there is no impact on grant eligibility. However, where appropriate, their income will be taken into account in assessing household income. </p><p>  I have increased the level of funding available for the grant schemes by 12% to &euro;38.4 million in 2014. Every local authority has been allocated increased funding for grants compared to the initial allocation in 2013. The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment, approval and payment of grants to applicants under the various grant measures, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. </p></reply>

My Department launched the Public Safety Initiative (PSI) in March 2011, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling &euro;4.5m to local authorities from the funding made available. To date, &euro;3.26m has been drawn down. </p><p>  The Public Safety Initiative provides funding only in instances where a developer has abandoned the development. However, in circumstances where the developer is merely inactive the responsibility for the maintenance and resolution of issues surrounding the development are matters which need to be addressed between the developer and the relevant stakeholders, and my Department has no remit in this regard. </p><p>  Budget 2014 contains a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments. The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition. </p><p>  My Department is currently evaluating SRF proposals from local authorities. I hope that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible. </p></reply>

Approval was also given for the provision of funding to the local authorities to cover the cost of accommodating HAP recipients, and it was agreed that the Department of Social Protection (DSP) would provide for the implementation of the mandatory direct deduction of rental contributions from the welfare payments of HAP recipients and local authority tenants. My Department and DSP continue to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in developing and introducing HAP. On 17 December 2013 the General Scheme of a Housing Bill providing for HAP was approved by Government and the Bill is in preparation, as a priority for enactment to facilitate the implementation of HAP in 2014. </p><p>  My Department is working closely with key stakeholders in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP, but more specifically at this stage in relation to the lead authority, Limerick City and County Council, initiating a pilot project by end of Quarter 1 2014. Subject to the required legislation being in place the full HAP scheme will then roll out to the other 6 local authorities (Cork, South Dublin, Monaghan, Kilkenny, Louth and Waterford) identified for participation in the first phase of HAP. </p><p>  Roll out to the remaining local authorities is scheduled to begin in 2015. During implementation, it is envisaged that authorities will initially focus on taking across new applicants, before moving on a progressive basis to dealing with those already in receipt of rent supplement. It is intended that the pilot and implementation phases will prioritise, as much as possible, the transfer to HAP of long-term unemployed rent supplement recipients, or those who are homeless or in danger of homelessness.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it .  Irish Water will not collect charges from any households not connected to a public water supply, including households served by private wells. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p><p>  The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.   The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers. </p><p>  An inter-departmental working group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges. This includes the examination of issues arising for those with specific medical conditions, which require high water usage.   The group comprises officials from my Department and from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.   A report will be submitted for consideration by Government based on the group&rsquo;s examination of the issues involved and the Government will decide on the proposed approaches to be taken in relation to affordability, medical needs and the free allowance. </p><p>The Government has committed to the provision of a free allowance, above which charging based on usage would apply. There is no question of people who do not use their free allowance being fined.   </p><p>  The CER will announce its decision on the approved water charges plan in August 2014. In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water, including the funding available for a free allowance and any proposed affordability measures.</p></reply>

The testing programme combines round-the-clock measurements from the permanent monitoring network and a programme of sampling followed by laboratory testing. Measurements are taken from the air, the marine environment, food products and drinking water. Data from these monitors is continuously fed back to a central system at RPII and displayed on the RPII&rsquo;s website: </p><p>  Following the incident at the Fukushima site, my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, in conjunction with the RPII, monitored the unfolding events in Japan. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, a national co-ordinating group, comprising the relevant Departments and agencies on the Emergency Response Co-ordination Committee, met a number of times to co-ordinate the response, <i>inter alia</i>, in the areas of food imports, general imports and travel advice.</p><p>  Following the incident at Fukushima, the RPII detected trace amounts of radioactivity in samples taken during the period March to May 2011, but the amounts here were at levels so low as to be only detectable with highly sensitive radio-analytical instrumentation.  As such, they were of no radiological significance in Ireland and accordingly, no protective measures were required. The levels detected were consistent with those measured elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>  The RPII&rsquo;s <i>Assessment of the Impact on Ireland of the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Accident</i>, published in March 2012 and available on the RPII website, concluded that the accident provided a good test of Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to respond effectively to a nuclear emergency. It demonstrated that a comprehensive monitoring network, capable of measuring even trace levels of radioactivity in the environment, is in place. </p><p>  My Department participated fully in the international response to the Fukushima incident and used the opportunity afforded by the EU Decision on stress-testing nuclear power plants around Europe to push for the highest safety standards to be applied. </p></reply>

The Charge operates on a self-assessment basis. The 2009 Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. Interpretation of the legislation may be a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately may be a matter for the Courts. </p><p>  Section 4 (4 ) of the 2009 Act provides that where a decree of divorce or a decree of judicial separation has been granted in respect of a marriage, a residential property in which a spouse retains an ownership interest but which is occupied by the other spouse as his or her sole or main residence will not attract a liability for the charge in respect of the spouse who does not reside there. There may be instances where the parties to a marriage have entered into a separation agreement but where no judicial recognition as such has been accorded to the separation agreement. If the separation agreement provides as above - i.e. one party is entitled to reside in the residential property free of rent while the other does not reside there but retains a financial interest in it - then the party not residing in the property is not an 'owner' within the meaning of the Act because they are no longer entitled to the rent of the property. In these circumstances, no liability for the charge would apply.   </p></reply>

If satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved through dialogue and negotiation , the option of seeking civil legal remedy may be considered. Given that a clear statutory framework is in place, I have no proposals for the introduction of a remediation process along the lines suggested. </p><p>  My Department continues to liaise with local authorities in relation to significant building control issues that have arisen in a number of multi-unit developments across the country . In this regard, local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Safety Act 1981, the Building Control Act 1990 and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant in relation to fire safety arrangements in residential buildings, and local authorities have successfully used such powers to deal with a number of instances of non-compliance. </p><p>  I have also amended the Building Control Regulations to require, in respect of building projects commencing on and from 1 March 2014, lodgement of design documentation, inspections during construction overseen by registered construction professionals, and certificates of compliance signed by designers, builders and assigned certifiers. The new regulations are designed to ensure that competence and professionalism become part and parcel of building projects generally and will lead to a new era of quality in our construction industry and ensure that the legacy of defective buildings seen in recent years will not recur.   </p></reply>

EU commitment to an effective, long-term globa l response to climate change is evident in the Climate and Energy Package adopte d in December 2008 , the Communication s from the Commission on A Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050 , and A policy framework for climate a nd energy in the <i></i> period from 202 0 to 2030.    Ireland has consistentl y supported EU pro-activity and leadership on climate policy, both in relation to framing the internal agenda and to the positive influence which the EU seeks to bring to the w ider international agenda under the UNFCCC.</p><p>  The programme for the development of national climate policy and legislation which I issued in January 2012 is the process under which national greenhouse gas mitigation policy and climate change adaptation policy are being progressed. In addition to the comprehensive open consultation undertaken by my Department in 2012, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht facilitated a round of stakeholder engagement on climate policy analysis undertaken by the Secretariat to the National Social and Economic Council and the outline Heads of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill , both of   which I released in February 2013.   I am now considering the Joint Committee&rsquo;s report, as well as a range of other issues, in the context of finalising the draft Heads of the Bill. Subject to the approval of Government, my intention is to publish the final Heads before Easter 2014.   </p><p>  In anticipation of the planned primary legislation, a National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050 is now being developed. At present, Departments with responsibility for the key sectors in the national transition agenda are currently preparing the sectoral elements for incorporation into the national roadmap. The key sectors are electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture. I intend to release the first draft of the 2050 National Low-Carbon Roadmap, together with a draft Strategic Environment Assessment, for a substantial period of open consultation later this year.   </p><p>  In parallel to the mitigation agenda, the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, which I issued in December 2012, provides for the development and implementation of sectoral and local adaptation action plans     which will form part of a comprehensive national response to the impacts of climate change. Under the framework, sectoral plans will be developed by the relevant Government Department or Agency and adopted by the relevant nister. Draft sectoral plans are due to be published by mid-2014, and details of the lead Departments and Agencies are set out in section 4 of the Framework. Local adaptation action planning will be undertaken by local authorities through the spatial planning process, with full engagement of key stakeholders, which provides an established means through which to implement and integrate climate change objectives, including adaptation, at local level. </p></reply>

Local authorities were not informed that contracts regarding the delivery of water services infrastructure not signed before 31 December 2013 could not proceed, rather that such projects would be reviewed by Irish Water in line with its&rsquo; strategic objectives. </p><p>  Irish Water is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2016 that will provide for the transition of projects included in the 2010 &ndash; 2013 Water Services Investment Programme.

The rates of duty applicable for half yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge respectively. This additional cost element takes account of the extra workload for staffing in motor tax offices and the National Vehicle and Driver File, and the resultant administrative costs and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices. </p><p>  The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-yearly and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of &euro;50m. A loss in income from this source would have a negative impact on the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund, and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.

The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the 2013 survey and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition. </p><p>My Department is currently evaluating SRF proposals from local authorities. I hope that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.   </p><p>  As regards other housing related supports made available, or potentially available, to County Wicklow, under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP), funding is provided to local authorities for a range of measures to improve the quality and standard of the social housing stock, including the regeneration of disadvantaged estates and flat complexes, estate-wide remedial works, the energy retrofitting of older properties and the provision of adaptations and extensions to meet the specific needs of tenants, along with the provision of social housing.  This year my Department has allocated funding of just under &euro;3 million to Wicklow County Council in respect of their 2014 social housing programme. In addition, earlier this month, as part of a two year local authority home building initiative, I announced the provision of 10 social units in the Wicklow County Council area at an estimated cost of &euro;780,000. </p><p>  My Department has also recently written to local authorities asking them to issue a &ldquo;Call for Proposals&rdquo; to Approved Housing Bodies for a new Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) for the period from 2014-2016. Some &euro;41 million is being provided nationally for projects assisted under CAS in 2014. Separately, my Department has also been in contact with local authorities advising that funding of up to &euro;30,000 per dwelling will be provided for a suite of retrofitting works to bring vacant properties back to a high standard.  In these two programmes, funding will be allocated on the basis of equitable and evidence based criteria which reflect the merit and cost effectiveness of proposals and the degree of local housing need. Local authorities are required to submit proposals to my Department by the end of March and I intend to announce details of the funding allocations as soon as possible afterwards.</p></reply>

While the matter of both authorised and illegal top -   ups in rent supplement have been discussed in the context of developing the business processes for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) my Department has not included an estimate of rental top-ups for the purposes of HAP in terms of what currently might be paid by tenants under the rent supplement scheme. </p><p>  In respect of the staff resources, the business process design exercise for HAP which was completed in 2013 involved input from all the relevant key stakeholders. This process included a preliminary examination of the organisational structure that will be required for HAP, including any change management issues that may arise. In the context of that exercise the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA), as part of the wider local government reform agenda, is considering the delivery possibilities including the costs and resource requirements. The CCMA, in conjunction with the local authorities involved in the first phase of HAP, are providing on-going advice to my Department in relation to the resources that will be required by local authorities to implement HAP. Limerick City and County Council as lead authority has led on preparation of a business case, under the direction of the HAP Project Board, for the delivery of HAP by local authorities. The business case is at an advanced stage of drafting. </p></reply>

As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital. Research indicated that the ban in Dublin resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths. The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas. On 31 August 2012, following a public consultation process, I gave effect to consolidating solid fuel regulations, S.I. No. 326 of 2012, that introduced a number of improved and updated provisions with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels. The updated provisions included the following -   </p><p>- the boundaries of most existing smoky coal ban areas were reviewed to take account of urban development in the intervening years since the regulations were originally made;   </p><p>- a complementary ban on the burning of smoky coal inside ban areas was introduced, to better support the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution; and   </p><p>- the ban was extended to sev en new towns with effect from May 2013, including Greystones and Wicklow   . </p><p>The ban now applies in 27 cities and towns nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones.   Maps of all smoky coal ban areas are available on my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash;</p><p>  Monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective. The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas. Similarly, the border with Northern Ireland would present enforcement challenges if a national ban on smoky coal were unilaterally introduced. However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.</p><p>  Under the auspices of the North South nisterial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from resid ential solid fuel use on an all- island basis. The study will include- </p><p>  - an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels; </p><p>  - consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy; and </p><p>  - an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching, the availability of smokeless fuels to supply an all-island market and job creation opportunities in the manufacture and supply of smokeless fuels.</p><p>   A final report is due in August 2014.</p></reply>

The Regulations are enforced by authorised local authority personnel who may undertake inspections of premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel , as well as collect samples.   A local authority may bring a prosecution under section 11 of the Air Pollution Act 1987 for breaches of the Regulations. The maximum penalty for breaches of the Regulations is a fine of &euro;5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months on summary conviction. </p><p>  The Regulations also require that each local authority submits annual returns to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), detailing activities undertaken relating to the implementation and enforcement of the Regulations in their functional areas. EPA figures show that in 2012, a total of 331 enforcement actions were initiated by local authorities. The returns for 2013 are not yet available. My Department has established a local authority implementation group (LAIG) for solid fuel enforcement. The LAIG serves as a forum to facilitate an exchange of information and intelligence between local authorities, the EPA and other interested parties with the aim of improving the consistency of implementation and enforcement of the Regulations.

Specific control requirements in relation to certain dog breeds were set out in the Control of Dogs (Restriction of Certain Dogs) Regulations 1991 and updated in 1998.   The decision to introduce these  urther specific control requirements was taken as a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners versus the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury.</p><p>  Several jurisdictions have addressed the matter of restrictions of particular breeds of dogs in a similar way to Ireland. It is worth noting that England, Northern Ireland, France and New Zealand all have similar restrictions on specific breeds of dogs.  My Department is, and will continue to be, in regular contact with interested parties such as Dogs Trust and the ISPCA on several matters, including the regulations in question. It is not my intention at present to amend the relevant legislative provisions.</p></reply>

This will be underpinned by new local governance arrangements that will seek to enhance involvement by citizens and communities in the implementation and targeting of services. The new measures will see the establishment of Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each local authority area over the coming mont hs in line with the provisions of   the recently enacted Local Government Reform Act 2014.</p><p>  These Committees will bring together both statutory and not-statutory partners, including the community sector, to bring greater co-ordination to area-based activity in their respective areas. Each LCDC will be tasked with developing the community elements of a 6-year Local Economic and Community Plan for its area, encompassing State funded local and community development programmes and interventions, including the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) which currently funds the Waterford Traveller Community Development Project, through the National Traveller Partnership (NTP).</p><p>  I am confident that the new committees, working with a wide range of local community groups, including also with local Traveller Interagency Groups, will bring a strong, strategic focus to the implementation of the Local Economic and Community Plan as well as the LCDP. This implementation will involve local development actors including development workers engaged in Local and Community Development Programmes in the Waterford area, and, therefore, the skills and experience that has been built up will continue to be available and utilised locally.   </p><p>  The social inclusion unit that currently operates in Waterford City Council will be part of the new unified city and county local authority when the merger is complete.  Waterford is one of 16 local authority areas with a social inclusion unit, and while the area of operation of the Waterford Social Inclusion unit will be greater following the merger, it will remain a valuable resource for the area, ensuring a continued strong focus on social inclusion. </p></reply>

While there has been considerable Exchequer investment in waste water treatment infrastructure in recent years, clearly that investment has not been sufficient and the report confirms where future investment is required.</p><p>  On 1 January 2014, Irish Water assumed responsibility for public water services. The establishment of Irish Water and the reform of water services provision are intended to deliver a new more sustainable funding model for the sector. Irish Water will be able to source much needed finance which can then be invested to address the remaining infrastructure deficits highlighted by the EPA report. I am also confident that Irish Water will eliminate the inadequate management practices which the EPA&rsquo;s report has highlighted as contributing to one third of sewage plant incidents. </p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 requires Irish Water to put in p lace a n investment plan setting out where it considers investment in infrastructure is necessary for the effective performance of its functions. In developing investment plans, Irish Water are required to take account of the water services strategic plan prepared under the legislation and a range of other policy considerations including river basin management plans and local area plans. Before preparing an investment plan, Irish Water is required to consult with   the E nvironmental Protection Agency and with the   planning authorities   . </p><p>  Irish Water is currently preparing an investment plan for 2014 &ndash; 2016 that will provide for the transition of projects previously included in my Department&rsquo;s 2010 - 2013 Water Services Investment Programme. </p></reply>

However, tenants seeking to fund the purchase through loan finance from the housing authority must meet the criteria that apply to such loans, which are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 and associated credit policy.  This policy provides that loans are not available to social welfare recipients, except where these constitute long-term Department of Social Protection payments in conjunction with a primary income of a permanent and salaried nature.  The final decision on whether or not to approve a loan in a particular case lies with the relevant housing authority, which must satisfy itself as to the borrower&rsquo;s capacity to service the loan over its full term.   </p><p>  The discounts available to tenants under the incremental purchase model are related to income rather than length of tenancy, thus enabling low-income households to move into home ownership earlier than would otherwise be the case.  The discount-related charge that the housing authority applies to the dwelling under incremental purchase is structured to make it attractive for households to put down long-term roots in the ir localities, thereby fostering more sustainable and integrated communities.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.  A residential property not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge.  This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and be living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons and in such a case, the property that the owner is no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it is the only residential property that person owns.  The 2009 Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. </p><p>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR charge.  The Act provides for a period, from on 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014, during which time no new late penalties will be applied to existing liabilities.  If payment is not made in full, or, if settlement terms are not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date is applied on 1 September 2014.  In addition, the entire NPPR liability is increased by a factor of 50% and frozen.  It is very much in the interest of non-compliant owners to come forward to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off opportunity.  The NPPR charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment.  Local authorities will be taking a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner. I am advising all non-compliant owners to log on to, or alternatively to contact their local authority and make arrangements to discharge their outstanding liabilities before 1 September 2014 to avoid incurring additional fees. </p></reply>

Since then, my Department has been liaising with the City Council to finalise the planning process and commence the demolition and refurbishment programme.  In 2013, my Department approved the City Council's proposals for the retrofitting of apartments to facilitate the de-tenanting of those apartment blocks which are scheduled for demolition.  This will facilitate the demolition of vacant blocks and the start of preparatory work for the construction of some 50 new apartments on the cleared site. </p><p>  The planning and design of the individual components of the overall regeneration programme is a matter for the City Council in consultation with the local community.

It is not a compensation scheme and section 14(8) of the Act specifically states that homeowners can not seek the recoupment of costs associated with the remediation of a dwelling undertaken prior to the commencement of the scheme.  The pyrite remediation scheme is one of &quot;last resort&quot; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress. Inclusion in the scheme is predicated, <i>inter alia</i>, on the dwelling being subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, and where this can be verified having regard to the I.S 398:1-2013, prior to works commencing.  This is in line with how similar Government schemes operate or have operated in the past, where prior approval is a key eligibility requirement for a scheme.  There are no plans to amend the legislation. </p><p>  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties, the homeowner, the builder, the supplier and/or their respective insurers and in the event that the parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts is available.   </p></reply>

The Environment Section of the relevant City or County Council is the appropriate contact point for reporting a noise nuisance in this regard.  In addition, under section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, where any noise is so loud, so continuous, so repeated, of such duration or pitch or occurring at such times as to give reasonable cause for annoyance, then it is open to any person, or group of persons, to bring a complaint to the District Court. The Court may order the person or body making, causing or responsible for the noise to take the measures necessary to reduce the noise to a specified level or to take specified measures for the prevention or limitation of the noise and the person or body concerned must comply with that order. </p><p>  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available to download from my Department's website at the following address: <i>. </i> The Court may take into account whether the person alleged to have caused a noise nuisance took all reasonable care to prevent or limit the noise by using facilities, practices and methods of operation that are suitable for that purpose.   </p><p>  The Private Security Authority (PSA), under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality, is responsible for the licensing, control and supervision of all installers of security equipment.  The PSA has powers to maintain and improve standards in the provision of services, including standards for intruder alarms.  As of 1 August 2006, alarm installers cannot legally operate without a PSA licence, the granting of which requires that the installer is compliant with the Irish Standard for intruder alarm systems, IS EN50131.  While this standard does not specify a maximum decibel level, it does specify a maximum duration of 15 minutes for the sounding of external alarms on buildings, which must cease automatically after this maximum duration.  This applies to all external alarms installed after 1 August 2006.   </p></reply>

However, before putting the question of signing and ratifying the Convention to Cabinet, the legislative and administrative changes that might be required to implement the Convention must be established.Consultations with relevant Government Departments and State agencies in relation to articles of the Convention which might impact on their areas of responsibility are now being undertaken.  In addition, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality have recently held public hearings to examine the issues of domestic and sexual violence with a view to compiling a report with recommendations on what measures can be put in place to reduce such violence.  My Department is already considering a wide range of proposals including proposals for reform from voluntary sector organisations and the recommendations from the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee will also be considered when it becomes available.  The development of these proposals will result in the consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation promised by this Government to address all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation, in a way that provides protection to victims.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-25a.1686.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032500087#WRKK01500"><p>I wish to inform the Deputy that demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board has increased significantly since the downturn in the economy and this has led to an increase in waiting times.  The waiting times as of 1 March 2014 are set out in the table below.  Demand in 2013 was at the same level as it was in 2012 and while there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.  The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2014 as it was in the previous three years.</p><p>  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised.  I know that waiting times are a matter of constant concern to the Board and that it keeps them under very active review.  I am also aware that the Board is constantly keeping the delivery of its services under review with a view to getting legal services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.  Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery.  The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board last year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.  In September 2013 I signed into law by way of Regulations, a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid.  The Regulations include a reduction in the capital eligibility threshold for legal services and they also include increases in the contributions payable by most persons seeking legal services. These provisions should have some impact, albeit relatively marginal, on the resources available to the Board.</p><p>  In response to the changed environment, the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services.  I will outline the nature of some of those steps.  The Board has been piloting a triage approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage.  The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times.  The aim of the triage approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice.  Consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes.  If the applicant requires further services they remain on the waiting list.  There is or has been a backlog of applicants to be seen for triage purposes, which is why it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month.  Where the triage approach is operative, there is a waiting time for the triage appointment and a waiting time for the second consultation.  A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative.  This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.</p><p>  In August 2012, the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres.  This is a start-to-end system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services.  It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise.  In November 2011, I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board.  A key reason for this transfer was to improve the synergies between the State-funded family mediation services and the State-funded civil legal aid services.  Most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law.  Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a litigation-first approach that may on occasion be too common.  Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House, which is where the Dublin District Family Court sits, involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there too.  Similar initiatives have been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated.  I know the Board is working particularly hard on promoting mediation as a meaningful option.</p><p>  While the Board's asylum-related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single grant-in-aid.  With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model, thereby effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased.  I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy.  I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice and legal area such as the Courts Service and the HSE )now the Child and Family Agency), with a view to trying to ensure State-funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.  I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to.  I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>Waiting times as at 1 March 2014<table><tr><th>Law Centre</th><th>Part-Time Centre</th><th>Waiting time for a first consultation</th><th>Further waiting time for a second consultation (centres operating triage)</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Athlone</td><td>24 weeks</td><td>9 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>Mullingar</td><td>24 weeks</td><td>10 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td> - </td><td>25 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td> - </td><td>17 weeks</td><td>42 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td> - </td><td>20 weeks</td><td>22 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td> - </td><td>5 weeks</td><td>31 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td> - </td><td>40 weeks</td><td>15 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Cork South</td><td> - </td><td>64 weeks</td><td>54 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td> - </td><td>16 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td> - </td><td>23 weeks</td><td>20 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td> - </td><td>30 weeks</td><td>6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Francis St</td><td> - </td><td>12 weeks</td><td>53 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Seville House</td><td> - </td><td>29 weeks</td><td>16 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Gardiner Street</td><td> - </td><td>17 weeks</td><td>42 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td> Carlow</td><td>3 weeks</td><td>45 weeks</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td> Kilkenny</td><td>3 weeks</td><td>44 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td> - </td><td>18 weeks</td><td>40 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td> - </td><td>44 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td> - </td><td>17 weeks</td><td>29 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>Drogheda</td><td>29 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>22 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Montague Court</td><td> - </td><td>22 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td> - </td><td>17 weeks</td><td>24 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td> - </td><td>4 weeks</td><td>35 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td> - </td><td>8 weeks</td><td>43 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Injuries Unit</td><td></td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td> - </td><td>48 weeks</td><td>59 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Boyle</td><td>5 weeks</td><td>24 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>Sligo</td><td>7 weeks</td><td>27 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Smithfield</td><td> - </td><td>44 weeks</td><td>35 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td> - </td><td>17 weeks</td><td>23 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>- </td><td>22 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td>- </td><td>17 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>-</td><td>24 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>-</td><td>47 weeks</td><td>7 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>- </td><td>13 weeks</td><td>n/a</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The key objective involved was to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  In this context, the Commissioner has concluded, in relation to certain stations, that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In making his recommendations on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  I fully agree with the Commissioner's conclusions in these matters.  Garda stations form part of the portfolio of State properties owned and maintained by the Office of Public Works.  In that context, the sale of Garda stations is a matter for that Office.</p></reply>

The execution of the warrants issued may have resulted in custodial sentences being imposed for non-payment of the fines, but this information is not available from Courts Service statistics.  Warrants could still issue in relation to some fines imposed in 2013 if the due date for payment has not yet expired.  The Irish Prison Service has also provided details of the number of people imprisoned for the non-payment of a TV licence following the execution of a warrant in the period concerned, as set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th><div>No. of persons imprisoned for non payment of TV Licence</div></th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td><div>75</div></td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td><div>152</div></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td><div>183</div></td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td><div>272</div></td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td><div>411</div></td></tr></table>The number of prisoners who are in prison for non-payment of a court ordered fine, including those imprisoned for the non-payment of a TV licence, is a tiny fraction of the overall prisoner population.  To illustrate this point, on 28 February 2014, nine people or 0.22%, out of a prison population of 4,086 were in custody for non-payment of fines.  None of them was in custody as a result of the non-payment of a TV licence.  The average cost of accommodating a typical fine defaulter based on the 2012 Cost of Offender figures (including variable costs of prisoner catering, prisoner gratuity, bedding, prisoner toiletries, dentist fees and medicines) equates to &euro;10.44 per prisoner space per day.</p></reply>

Outside of this area, registration is undertaken in Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na District stations.  The public office in Burgh Quay is by far the busiest registration office in the State serving over 70% of those non-nationals subject to registration requirements.  Every effort is made to accommodate the various categories of persons required to register.  The GNIB Public Office is open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. each Monday to Thursday and from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. each Friday (excluding bank holidays).  The Offices also remains open through lunchtime.  Priority is given in the early morning period for particular categories including those coming here to work, etc. with tickets for people registering their presence in Ireland for study-related purposes being allocated after 9 a.m.  This is to minimise the amount of time people at work are required to be away from their jobs.  It is worth noting that the public immigration offices receive in the region of 130,000 people annually in respect of registration of non-EEA people residing in the State and applicants seeking re-entry visas as well as callers seeking information or for other business.</p><p>  The nature of the registration requirements necessitates the personal attendance of the applicant at his or her registration office.  Every effort is made to ensure the process is undertaken in a timely manner.  First-time registrations take longer because of the need to take biometric information.  The GNIB endeavours, where possible, to provide a same-day service for non-nationals who pay the required fee for a registration certificate by way of Debit or Credit card.  A person paying the said fee by way of bank giro is required to return to the Registration Office on another day when the payment has been verified for the purpose of being issued with a registration certificate.  I am conscious of the need to maintain and develop good service levels to customers.  In this regard, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is undertaking a number of projects with the aim of developing and improving immigration services.  In the area of reform of in-country aspects of immigration services, INIS is looking at developing a range of measures including online application and appointment systems for certain services, including registration.  This should help alleviate time spent waiting for services and assist the person in scheduling appointments to best suit their working arrangements.</p></reply>

However, as the application did not satisfy the eligibility criteria, the application was refused, also in November 2012.</p><p>  Long Term Residency is granted on the basis that non EEA national has completed five years legal residency on work permit/work authorisation/ working visa or green card permit conditions. The applicant must be deemed to be of good character. Additionally. all applicants must have permission to remain in the State at the time the application is submitted, and be in gainful employment throughout and after the application process. Residency is calculated  from the corresponding Stamp1/Stamp 4 endorsements in an applicant's passport and not by the dates of commencement and expiry of each work permit/work authorisation/ working visa or green card permit.</p><p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for Long Term Residency if and when they are in a position to meet the eligibility criteria. Full details of the qualifying criteria can be found on www.inis.gov.ie.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.The Deputy may consider using the email service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.  </p></reply>

I have, however, been informed that some 25,000 applications were received for the current competition.  It is understood that around 18,000 candidates completed stage 1 tests of which less than 13,000 reached a satisfactory standard. These 13,000 candidates were placed in three Bands in order of merit.  All candidates have been informed by PAS of the results of these tests and of their position in each Band.</p><p>  The top 5,000 candidates were placed in Band 1.  These were then called to the next stages of the competition which involve further online unsupervised assessment tests and ultimately supervised tests, interviews, medical examinations and security checks.  All these tests are designed to identify candidates who are suitable to be a Garda trainee. Candidates who are successful through all stages will be placed on a panel for entry into training in the Garda College.  A candidate who fails any stage of the process will be eliminated from the competition and will not be allowed re-enter. </p><p>  The Regulations provide that, as part of the competitive selection process organised by the Public Appointments Service for full-time membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, <i>&quot;due recognition to any satisfactory service by the person as a reserve member&quot;</i>  shall be given to such candidates.  This provision was introduced in order to acknowledge the beneficial experience and skills gained by a reserve member and to allow them, at assessments and at interview,  the opportunity to highlight that experience and skill. It is important that all persons wishing to join the full time force undergo the same competitive selection and recruitment process.  In doing so the integrity of the process is maintained at all stages of the competition.</p><p>  My objective is to maintain Garda strength at 13,000 and the number of trainees to be recruited will be determined taking that objective into account along with the rate of departures from the force over the coming years. It is hoped to have 300 recruits entering training in Templemore in 2014.</p></reply>

As he will be aware, the background circumstances are linked to a very tragic set of events which occurred in 2009 and resulted in the death of two persons.  I am very conscious of the fact that these deaths have impacted significantly on the families concerned. </p><p>  The primary legislation currently applicable to coroners is the Coroners Act 1962.  With regard to the holding of an inquest the position is that under the 1962 Act a coroner is a statutory officer exercising quasi-judicial functions, in relation to which he or she is independent.  Accordingly, a coroner is responsible for the holding of an inquest and for conducting the inquest.  In that regard it is not open to myself or to my Department to intervene in relation to a particular case.  In so far as section 15 of the Act is concerned it should be noted that this section is primarily concerned with the removal of coroners from office and it does not confer general powers of inquiry on the Minister.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Coroners Bill 2007 was restored to the Order Paper in 2011.  The Bill provides for a comprehensive overhaul of the law relating to coroners and it makes provision for the recognition of the views of a victim&rsquo;s family.   In particular section 36 of the Bill provides that the coroner is required to inform the family of the deceased person, or such interested person as the coroner considers appropriate, of a range of matters relating to the investigation of the death. For example, the coroner would be required, in so far as is practicable, to keep such persons informed of the progress and conclusion of the investigation. The Deputy can be assured that the concerns he has raised will be fully taken into account in the review of the Coroners Bill which is being carried out within my Department.   </p></reply>

My Department is also aware that the European Commission report makes no allegation that such profiling is actually carried out.  This is not surprising given that an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do not engage in racial profiling. In that regard I am advised that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not engage in discriminatory ethnic or racial profiling, and specifically that it does not engage in data gathering or data mining based upon discriminatory profiling in respect of race, colour, language, religion, nationality, national or ethnic origin, ethnicity or membership of the traveller community. </p><p>  Racial profiling in services offered by the Garda&iacute; is already prohibited by race discrimination under Equal Status legislation. However, investigation of crime, public order etc are not services - they come under the controlling functions of the State and, as such, are outside the scope of equality legislation. The question of whether we should create a legislative prohibition therefore needs to be considered in that light.</p><p>  This is of course a complex matter.  Ireland has become a much more diverse society and indeed the nature of Irishness has evolved as many people from overseas have made their homes here.  At the same time immigration control is an important national interest and our laws must be enforced.  I believe however that it is perfectly possible to operate an effective system of immigration control without resorting to racial profiling but relying instead on good intelligence and the professional judgement and experience of our Garda&iacute; and immigration officers and indeed this has been demonstrated to be the case. I will consider this matter further in the development of the Immigration Protection and Residence Bill which I propose to republish later this year.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the conduct of any court case including the reasons for a decision is a matter for the presiding judge. </p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that when a driver fails to pay a fixed penalty notice within 56 days, the Garda&iacute; apply to the Courts Service for the issue of a summons. The Courts Service fixes a date for the hearing of the case and the summons is issued to the Garda&iacute; for service on the defendant who is required to appear on the date specified on the summons.  Therefore, all summonses that are issued are listed for court. All of the persons summoned, however, may not appear before the court.</p><p>  If a summons is not served then the court has no jurisdiction to hear the case and a result of strike out not served is recorded. You will appreciate that summonses may not have been served by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a number of different reasons.  The Garda authorities may be unable to serve summonses in instances where they are unable to make contact with the individual concerned; there may be inaccurate or false name and address data relating to the person; the person may no longer be resident or known at the address; or the person may be residing outside this jurisdiction or indeed may have taken steps to avoid receipt of a summons.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Action Plan which I published along with the Garda Inspectorate Report into the Fixed Charge Processing System, I set out how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has already commenced a review of the summons serving process.  The outcome of this process, which is taking place in consultation with the Courts Service, will be examined by the recently established Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group and will form part of the regular reports from that Group to myself and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>  As already indicated to the Deputy in my reply to Parliamentary Questions numbers 462, 463 and 464 of 14 May 2013, the number of defendants summoned to court having failed to pay a fixed charge penalty point notice within 56 days of receipt of the notice in 2011 was 51,462 and in 2012 was 53,927. It should be noted that where an individual was summonsed in respect of more than one offence they are included once in those figures. </p><p>  The  table below shows outcomes in respect of all of the penalty point summonses issued following a failure to pay the fixed charge notice.  The statistics contained in the table are based on the number of outcomes rather than the number of defendants.  A defendant may incur a number of outcomes for different offences and the outcomes are counted separately.    The number of outcomes, therefore, is greater than the number of defendants referred to above.  Mandatory court appearances for other penalty point offences are not included.   </p><p><table><tr><th>Outcomes</th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th></tr><tr><td>Strike out not

There were however 39 Garda Stations closed in 2012 of which 4 were in the Mayo Garda Division (Glenisland, Tourmakeady, Mulranny and Bellacorrik). There were 100 Garda Stations closed in 2013 of which 6 were in the Mayo Garda Division (Ballyvary, Ballyglass, Ballycastle, Lahardane, Blacksod and Hollymount).</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the closure of the stations was proposed by the Garda Commissioner in his Policing Plans for 2012 and 2013.  The key objective involved was to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  In this context the Commissioner has concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In making his recommendations on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations. I fully agree with the Commissioner's proposals in this regard.</p><p>   While the number of retirements of Garda&iacute; in the Mayo Garda Division in 2000 to 2010 is not readily available, there have been 33 retirements of Gardai in that Division since 2011. The personnel strength of the Mayo Garda Division from 2011 to 31 January 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is shown in the following table. There are also currently 35 Garda Reserves and 32 Civilians attached to the Mayo Garda Division.<table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Strength</div></th><th><div>Retirements</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>309</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>300</div></td><td><div>16</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>307</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>31/01/2014</div></td><td><div>306</div></td><td><div>(up to 14/03/14) 3</div></td></tr></table></p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of all personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. This necessary ongoing flexibility in the distribution of personnel means that it is not feasible to identify specific vacancies within specific areas or Divisions of the Force.</p></reply>

Marriages of convenience are notoriously difficult to prove and our constitutional protection of marriage makes uncovering these situations more problematic.</p><p>  This is a complex issue and there is no single, legislative or operational approach that will permanently eliminate the problem.  The authorities deploy a range of measures and cooperate closely in tackling this problem.  This is a high priority of all the services, agencies and other organisations tasked with preventing or negating any benefits to the persons who engage in these activities.</p><p>  In addition to our operational response I have asked my officials to re-examine the provisions in the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2010 and to draft amendments dealing with immigration related marriages of convenience and sham marriages.  A similar approach is being taken in respect of the Free Movement Regulations that transposed the EU Directive into Irish law.  I also understand that officials from the Department of Social Protection are examining possible legislative measures to address the civil registration aspects of marriages of convenience.</p><p>  At the European level there are also a number of initiatives focused at abuse on legal migration channels such as marriages of convenience.  In 2009 the Commission published guidelines on the better implementation of Directive 38/2004/EC on Free Movement.  The guidelines contained a specific chapter of abuse and fraud which included some guidance on identifying marriages of convenience.  More recently; in 2012, the Commission began work, in consultation with Member States, on drawing up a handbook for practitioners investigation shame marriages or marriages of convenience.  We understand that work is well advance in relation to this handbook.</p></reply>

While I am of course concerned at these incidents, the Deputy will be aware that the most recent official crime statistics show a reduction in the number of recorded incidents of murder and manslaughter offences, and the number of killings associated with organised crime has also fallen in recent years.  I have sought a detailed report from the Garda authorities on the further specific statistics sought by him and will contact him again when it is available.</p><p>  No-one underestimates the challenges faced by the Garda&iacute; in tackling organised crime and investigating what are typically very carefully planned shootings but the Garda&iacute; are impacting on these organisations and disrupting their activities, with major drug seizures taking place, and many of those involved brought before the courts and serious penalties handed down.</p><p>  In particular, the Garda Policing Plan 2014 sets out the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activity.  Multi-disciplinary approaches are used to ensure the effective targeting of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation, the organised crime provisions in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p><p>  Homicide rates continue to be monitored closely and investigations are actively progressed under the daily supervision of local Garda Management and specially appointed Senior Investigating Officers supported by Garda&iacute; attached to National Units.</p><p>  I have every confidence that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, through targeted operations utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods.</p></reply>

The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Any decision regarding the suitability for a position of a particular vetting subject is a matter for the organisation concerned.</p><p>  Elements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 relating to the disclosure of convictions are under review at present having regard to a recent judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in (On the Application of) T and others v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester [2013]. The UK Court considered the circumstances in which it is appropriate to disclose convictions for old, minor offences with particular regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Having considered the judgement in that case, I intend bringing proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act. Given the close relationship between this Act and the Spent Convictions Bill, which is before the Oireachtas at the moment, any changes to the Vetting Act will have to be reflected in the Spent Convictions Bill. The amendment of the Vetting Act will also be done via the Spent Convictions Bill.</p><p>  Until now all records of all criminal convictions have been disclosed by the Garda&iacute; when vetting people for various employments. However, in future certain minor offences that are more than seven years old, where the person has not subsequently reoffended, will not be disclosed. In addition, cases of minor offences where charges are struck out will not be disclosed. More serious offences, however, such as all sexual offences, offences against the person, serious motoring offences, firearms offences, robbery, or any offence for which the person is convicted on indictment will continue to be disclosed in all cases.</p><p>  Pending commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 the revisions in approach outlined above will, in the interim, be applied on an administrative basis by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.</p></reply>

It remains the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the great majority of migrants comply with this condition.</p><p>  If a person is undocumented his/her case can be considered on its merits by officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.  Such cases are presented on a regular basis.  Part of this consideration involves looking at the extent to which the person's situation is through no fault of his/her own.  Other other relevant circumstances, particularly those of a humanitarian nature, will also be considered.  Sometimes consideration of the case will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.  In other cases, the  decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, would be that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.</p><p>  Broad regularisation programmes are problematic and could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services. At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In our case there are also significant considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</p><p>  Any significant departure from well established policies in this respect would have a major impact on the operation of the Common Travel Area both here and in the United Kingdom which is of the most fundamental importance to the economic well being of the State.</p></reply>

The Programme allows naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth and Syrian nationals already lawfully resident in the State to make an application for vulnerable close family members to join them in Ireland on a temporary basis for up to two years. These are persons who are considered by their sponsoring family member present in Ireland to be most at risk. A sponsor may be a single person or the head of a family unit.  Persons admitted under the programme will be entitled to work, establish a business, or invest in the State. A key condition of the programme is that these persons should not become a burden on the State. If these family members cannot find employment the onus will be on the sponsors to support them during their time in Ireland.</p><p>  I am informed by INIS that details of the SHAP application procedure and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) are available on the INIS website www.inis.gov.ie and that the final date for the submission of applications under the Programme is 5pm on Friday 25 April 2014. Queries in relation to this programme can also be made via email to SHAP@justice.ie.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Where a serving member is in authorised occupation of such quarters, the Regulations provide for deductions to be made from pay in respect of the accommodation provided.  On retirement or discharge from the Defence Forces a serving member ceases to be eligible to occupy quarters and is required to vacate the property within twenty one days.

In addition, they are liable to charges for electricity supplied to the quarters that they continue to overhold.</p><p>  Occupation of quarters by the spouse and children of a former member of the Defence Forces to whom the quarters were allocated is considered to be occupation by the former member themselves.

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas, and the total number of personnel currently posted from the Army, Navy and Air Corp to various  overseas operations under the aegis of the EU, are listed in the tabular statements attached.</p><p>  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 204 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) with 112 Defence Forces personnel.</p><p>  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission (EUTM) Somalia with six (6) personnel, the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with eight (8) personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with seven (7) personnel; the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with twelve (12) personnel; and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with seven (7) personnel. Four (4) personnel were deployed in August 2013 for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in South Sudan. Ireland also contributes 26 observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions, 3 personnel to the Nordic Battle group headquarters in Sweden and 15 other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters.</p><p>  Defence Forces participation in all overseas missions is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The overall drawdown of ISAF personnel is currently underway and the withdrawal of the Defence Forces personnel will be coordinated in this context. While it is anticipated that Irish personnel will complete their service with the mission in September 2014, this will be kept under review in the context of the  proposed NATO led follow on training advisory and assistance mission.</p><p>  As regards future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.</p><p>  Apart from the recent deployment of personnel to the UNDOF mission, no new deployments are envisaged at this time.</p><p>  The current contribution of some 404 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p><p><b><i>AS OF 01 MARCH 2014</i></b><table><tr><th>1.</th><th>UN MISSIONS</th><th><div>-</div></th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ</td><td><div>16</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNIFIL 42nd Infantry Group</td><td><div>184</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNIFIL Sector West HQ</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation ) Israel &amp;amp; Syria</td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo)</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast)</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNDOF (United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) Golan Heights Syria</td><td><div>112</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNMAS (United Nations Mine Action Service ) South Sudan</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>342</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>EUFOR (EU led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>EUTM Somalia (EU led Training Mission)</td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>EUTM Mali (EU led Training Mission)</td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ</td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>ISAF (International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan)</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS</td><td><div>382</div></td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)</td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>OSCE Mission in Belgrade &ndash; Serbia</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group Vienna</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING OSCE</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>EU MILITARY STAFF</td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Brussels</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>NORDIC BATTLE GROUP 2015</td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>FHQ Sweden</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF</td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Military Adviser Irish delegation to OSCE, Vienna</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Military Representative to EU (Brussels)</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Liaison Office of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels)</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS</td><td><div>404</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Irish Defence Forces personnel deployed to missions under the aegis of the EU (21 March 2014)</i></b><table><tr><th><div>Mission</div></th><th><div>Air Corps</div></th><th><div>Army</div></th><th><div>Naval Service</div></th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td>EUTM Somalia</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>EUTM Mali</td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>EUFOR BiH</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1 </td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>21</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice. Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multi lateral-training and assessment. This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces training methods and standards within an international military context.  Defence Forces personnel continue to have the most modern and effective range of equipment and technology available for their training and day-to-day roles.</p><p>  Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping duties, this also includes mission specific training.   Pre-deployment training is updated on a regular basis, to include lessons learned from previous missions.  Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment.  This equipment enables troops to carry out the roles assigned, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission. Ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and we continually review both personal equipment and force assets, to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles.  I am satisfied that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Partnership for Peace has allowed the Defence Forces to gain access to NATO standards &ndash; which are internationally-recognised as representing best practice in military and related matters such as operations, procurement, training, civilian cooperation, etc.</p><p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for me as Minister for Defence and is a matter that is kept under constant review at a senior level in my Department and in the Defence Forces.</p><p>  In the current economic climate the budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and equipment upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis in accordance with operational priorities with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.</p><p>  I am assured by the Chief of Staff that the Defence Forces are adequately equipped and trained to meet the many demands and tasks Government has assigned to them.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel and this current campaign will enable this to be achieved.</p><p>  Recruitment of personnel to the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps is determined in line with the operational requirements of each of the three services. The Defence Forces plan to induct up to 400 personnel to the Permanent Defence Force (both Army and Navy) and up to 500 personnel to the Reserve Defence Force (both Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve) in 2014. This will be the first intake of recruits to the Reserve following on from the reorganisation of the Permanent and Reserve Defence Force in line with the &lsquo;Single Force Concept&rsquo; whereby Reserve Units are embedded into Permanent Defence Force Formations.</p><p>  This new recruitment campaign is designed to attract enthusiastic and committed men and women from all backgrounds and ethnicities to a career in the Defence Forces. With the changes in the make-up of Ireland&rsquo;s population, it is important that we raise awareness and attract recruits from all backgrounds, including the new Irish, so that our Defence Forces, Permanent and Reserve, reflect the society that they serve.  As part of the recruitment campaign the Defence Forces are contacting various groups representative of the different ethnic groups in the State.  There is also extensive engagement with schools, colleges and sports clubs and organisations. The Defence Forces are particularly interested in attracting applications from women. The Defence Forces is committed to full equality among all its personnel irrespective of gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation.</p><p>  The recruitment competition for both the Permanent and Reserve Defence Force is being run through a centralised online application system on the Defence Forces website .  All correspondence is conducted via e-mail. Details of the competitions, the closing date for which is 9 April 2014, are available on the website.  </p><p>  While no specific measures are being taken to encourage the young unemployed to join the Defence Forces, the Recruitment competition has been widely advertised in the National and Regional Press and Media and is also on &ldquo;Careers Portal&rdquo;, a National career guidance website. Information on service in the Defence Forces is also available through the Defence Forces social media platforms, on Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>  Applicants for recruitment to both the Permanent and Reserve Defence Force will be required to complete broadly similar assessments. Candidates for recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force must successfully complete fitness testing, online psychometric testing, interview and psychometric testing verification, in order to progress through the competition. Following these stages of the recruitment process, successful applicants may be placed on panels and may be offered a position, subject to successfully completing a medical examination and obtaining Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Security Clearance. Candidates for recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force follow a similar process, but do not undergo psychometric testing. </p><p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

The acquisition of new equipment for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service is a matter that is kept under constant review at a senior level in my Department and in the Defence Forces, through joint participation in the High Level Planning and Procurement Group. This Group is charged with identifying equipment requirements and agreeing on a procurement programme to provide the Defence Forces with type and quantities of equipment necessary to carry out their assigned duties. These are all issues that are also a consideration in the drafting of the new White Paper on Defence.</p><p>  However, the fact remains that in the current economic climate the budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and for equipment upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis in accordance with operational priorities with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.</p><p>  On the transport side, the Defence Forces has a significant fleet of vehicles. In recent years, a number of vehicle purchases took place which included Minibuses, standard patrol vehicles and mid-coaches for troop transportation. In addition, funding is provided on a continuous basis for the required maintenance and servicing of vehicles in the military transport fleet.</p><p>  The Air Corps operate a maintenance plan which endeavors to ensure that the maximum number of operational flying hours is available from aircraft when most needed. The maintenance of the Air Corps fleet falls into three broad categories: scheduled, unscheduled and routine/daily. The use of Power by the Hour/Performance Based maintenance contracts assists the Air Corps in keeping downtime of aircraft to the minimum. The provision for the Air Corps in 2014 mainly relates to these maintenance and Power by the Hour contracts set up to keep the Air Corps fleet fully operational with specific maintenance work being carried out on the CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft related to the overhaul of engines on the aircraft.  The question of proceeding with any replacement aircraft programme for the Air Corps will be considered in tandem with the new White Paper on Defence, the overall equipment requirements of the Defence Forces generally and the funding envelope available in the coming years.</p><p>  The provision of two new offshore Patrol Vessels for the Naval Service is well advanced with the first ship due for delivery shortly and the second ship scheduled for delivery in early 2015.  These modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure the Naval Service continues to meet the required operational capability.</p></reply>

This programme has brought to fourteen the number of barracks closed during that time. To date nine of these barracks - Clancy (Dublin), Castleblaney, Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Monaghan, Cavan, Castlebar and a large portion of Longford - have been sold.  In relation to the remaining barracks agreement has been reached for the sale of Lifford barracks to Donegal County Council. Discussions had also been ongoing for a considerable period of time with the Council in relation to the sale of Rockhill House, however at a recent meeting with officials of my Department the Council was not in a position to give a firm commitment to acquiring the property at this stage. It is proposed therefore to dispose of the property by public auction within the next couple of months.</p><p>  Discussions are at an advanced stage in relation to the sale of the former barracks in Clonmel to South Tipperary County Council and I expect that the sale will be finalised over the coming weeks. The remaining part of Longford has been reserved for sale to the Office of Public Works for the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>  Magee Barracks in Kildare and Columb Barracks in Mullingar remain the property of the Department of Defence. Columb Barracks is currently used by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service for training purposes and a large part of the barracks has been licenced to Westmeath GAA Board for use as a potential centre of excellence. Discussions are at an advanced stage with the Board in relation to the possible lease of the whole facility and these discussions should be completed over the coming months.  </p><p>  In addition to the main barracks outlined above a number of other properties have also been identified as surplus to military requirements over the past twenty years. A large number of these have already been disposed of whilst others are in the process of being prepared for disposal. These mainly consist of married quarters, Reserve Defence Force (RDF) premises and training lands. An auction of ten former RDF properties in early December 2013 yielded approximately &euro;1m.  The total realised to-date in terms of sales of surplus property over the last twenty years is  &euro;106m approx.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit.The Defence Forces prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment. Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks. The military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner. </p><p>  As part of the recently announced recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts are being made to increase the number of female applicants as part of a wider campaign aimed at improving gender and ethnic representation and diversity in the Defence Forces.  In the case of female participation, these efforts include school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and use of social media.  </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the strength figures for the period 2009 - 2012 include personnel who were on secondment to, and being paid by other organisations, or on career breaks.

By its latest resolution 2131 of 18 December 2013, the Security Council stressed the obligation of both Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic to scrupulously observe the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement and abide by its terms. It underscored that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other than those of UNDOF. It also called on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions within the UNDOF Area of Operations.  UNDOF currently has a military strength of approximately 1,236 with a further 145 civilian staff. A total of six countries currently contribute to the mission including Ireland, India, Fiji, Netherlands, Philippines and Nepal.</p><p>  Following Government and D&aacute;il approval, the deployment of the 43rd Infantry Group to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights was successfully completed on 28 September 2013.  The 43rd Infantry Group, comprising 112 personnel, consists of a Force Reserve Company and support elements. Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility. The Irish Infantry Group is also tasked with carrying out patrols and convoy escorts as necessary. In addition to the Force Reserve Company there are also five (5) Defence Forces personnel based in UNDOF Headquarters in Camp Faouar on the Golan Heights. </p><p>  Irish personnel serving with UNDOF Force Reserve Company will be rotated on a six-monthly basis. Members of the 43rd Infantry Group will shortly complete their six month tour of duty at the end of this month when they will be replaced by members of the 44th Infantry Group. </p><p>  An incident, where Irish Troops came under small arms fire did occur in UNDOF in November last year. At that time an Irish patrol, with five (5) Armoured Personnel Carriers, was escorting Philippino personnel to their post in the UNDOF area of operations when they came under fire. Irish troops returned fire. While the patrol was withdrawing one Armoured Personnel Carrier was hit by an explosion which damaged its rear right wheel.  The cause of the explosion was later determined to be a landmine.  The patrol withdrew to a defensive location and later successfully returned to UNDOF headquarters in Camp Faouar.  During the incident in question, one member of the Irish patrol suffered a minor back injury.  He was treated in hospital in Israel, for precautionary tests and returned to duty in Camp Faouar the following day. </p><p>  Irish troops are deployed to the Golan Heights at a time of increased instability in that region.  That was the situation pertaining in the region when D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann considered this issue last July, when it decided to deploy the contingent to UNDOF.  It was never the case that this deployment was going to be easy.  Both the political and the security situation in the region is volatile; that is why we are there.</p></reply>

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.</p><p>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:-</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. I am aware that a claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter and has been the subject of intense discussions and negotiations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.  </p><p>  However, I am confident that in examining this claim from PDFORRA, all pertinent facts, including cost to the Exchequer and benefit to the Defence Forces are being considered.  It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association within the next few weeks.</p></reply>

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s fishery protection legislation and our obligations as a member of the European Union. A strategy for the replacement of Naval Service Offshore Patrol Vessels is currently in train. A contract was signed in October 2010, with Babcock Marine for the provision of two new offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service. The first ship to be named LE Samuel Beckett is scheduled for delivery in the coming weeks. The second ship to be named LE James Joyce will follow in January 2015. The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level. There are no plans to purchase an aircraft carrier for the Naval Service.</p></reply>

The directive is designed to further enhance the high level of protection achieved through the entire regulatory system for pesticides. This Directive (Directive 2009/128/EC) is transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 155 of 2012.  </p><p>  This S.I. prohibits the application of pesticides from aircraft (aerial spraying) except under extenuating circumstances and only after a comprehensive and exhaustive risk assessment is carried out. This risk assessment is carried out by the competent authority in each Member State. To that end, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the competent authority responsible for conducting such risk assessments and for the issuance of any permit to allow such aerial application to occur.  </p><p>  It should be noted that no aerial application of pesticides has occurred on farmland in Ireland since 1993. On that occasion it was deemed absolutely necessary due to extreme weather conditions whereby farmers were unable to apply plant protection products to potato crops using their own equipment. The exercise was carried out under the strict supervision of officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. In addition, my Department limited the products that could be applied to the affected potato crops. Only products with a more favourable environmental profile and that were of less concern to public health, were permitted.</p><p>  The aerial application of plant protection products is a very specialised job and thus is only carried out by specialist contractors (none of which are based in Ireland). The aerial application which occurred in Ireland in 1993 was carried out by a UK based contractor.  The issue of experimental weather modification is not a matter for my Department.</p></reply>

In general sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme.  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. </p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will experience immediate benefit as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m.</p></reply>

Lithuania does not have a quota for Blue Whiting in the Western waters, however  EU records show that they have received 5,000  tonnes from the Netherlands in 2014 as a result of an exchange.  Lithuania has a quota of 120 tonnes of Mackerel in  Western Waters.  I do not have information on how Lithuania internally allocate these quotas to its fleet and such information is not made available to Member States.  </p><p>  All fishing vessels must also comply with all EU Regulations relating to the Common Fisheries policy, including reporting of catches and respecting technical measures such as mesh size.  Control of the fishing within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fishery Zone is a matter for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, operational issues concerning sea fisheries control are a matter for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service.

In this reply, my Department explained that, in accordance with the rules governing the calculation of milk yield for the purposes of valuing a cow under the ERAD compensation schemes, the number of cows used for the purposes of this calculation is the number present at the breakdown test of 17 May 2012.  There was no option within these rules to use the number of cows at any of the earlier tests in the herd. It was also explained that, in any event, even if it were possible to discount the two cows that were stated not to be milking, there would be no material change in the valuation band used to calculate the milk yield of the herd.</p><p>  The person concerned was also informed that this decision may be appealed to the Agriculture Appeals Office, Kilminchy Court, Portlaoise, Co Laois and that any appeal must be lodged to the Agriculture Appeals Office within 3 months of this decision.</p></reply>

This inspection was carried out without the need to visit the farm. However, as it revealed overclaims it was necessary to carry out a rapid field visit (RFV). RFVs are not full farm inspections and involve an inspection of only the parcels where over-claims were detected by an examination of the satellite imagery and where confirmation is required, by an on the ground visit. Advance notice does not normally arise in inspections of this type.  </p><p>  Following the RFV the applicant was notified via a Formal Notification of the possibility of penalties. While this Formal Notification did issue to the applicant it is not standard operating procedure that applicants get copies of the complete inspection report. Following this inspection the person named was informed in writing dated 6 February 2014 that overclaims were found on specific parcels which he had declared and that it was the opinion of the inspecting officer that these overclaims were deemed to have been made intentionally</p><p>  The person named appealed in writing dated 14 February 2014. The matter was referred to the District Superintendent for re-examination. That re-examination concluded that the original findings were correct. In addition, it was discovered that a further parcel was ineligible as it was not stock proof. Based on these findings the person named was informed that the original decision was upheld. As parcels declared by the person named were deemed to have been intentionally over claimed the Terms and Conditions governing the scheme indicate that no payments are due in respect of the year concerned. This decision was communicated to the person named on 18 March. Part of that communication informed the person named of his right to appeal to the Agriculture Appeals office within three months of the date of the decision. </p><p>  The rules governing the schemes are set down in an extensive Help Sheet/Terms and conditions that issued with the application form. Officials from my Department have been in contact with the person named regarding the matter, however if the person named has a specific issue that requires clarification he can contact the relevant Section directly on this. </p><p>  Finally, maps for all eligible parcels claimed by any applicant in any given year are provided to all applicants, as part of the following year&rsquo;s application process.</p></reply>

Number 301 of 2007). Subject to due process, positive results are published. The committees referred to above make the final determination in relation to publication of the positive results.</p><p>  Samples are tested for prohibited substances in the National Greyhound Laboratory at Bord na gCon headquarters in Limerick.  When a sample is declared positive by the National Greyhound Laboratory, owners/trainers are afforded due process including a hearing at the Control Committee and an appeal to the Control Appeal Committee.  This can cause a significant time lag from the initial notification of the positive sample to subsequent publication of the results of the positive samples. Consequently, the number of cases published in a particular  year can span more than 1 calendar year.</p><p>  I understand from Bord na gCon  that in all, total of  4807, 6893 and 7307 on-course samples tests were carried out for prohibited substance in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. There were 45 (0.9%) laboratory positive tests in 2011, 56 (0.8%) in 2012 and 51 (0.7%) in 2013.    </p><p>  Of the 45 positive tests in 2011 - 41 were published by the Control Committee (although not all published in that year), 3 were dismissed in favour of the owner and 1 was appealed to the Control Appeal Committee, which upheld the original findings.     </p><p>  Of the 56 positive cases in 2012 - 8 were published by the Control Committee (although not all published in that year), 9 will be published shortly, 20 were found in favour of the owner, and 19 are still pending deliberation by the Control Committee.</p><p>  Of the 51 laboratory positive cases in 2013 , 7 cases were published by the Control Committee in January 2014, 11 are awaiting imminent publication, 2 cases were dismissed in favour of the owner and 31 are still pending deliberation by the Control Committee.</p><p>  I understand from Bord na gCon that the number of published details of positive findings in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 years was 31, 30 and 0, respectively. However, 17 cases were published in January 2014 and Bord na gCon expects that approximately a further 20 cases will be published shortly.</p><p>  On a general point, I have commissioned an independent review of certain matters in relation to Bord na gCon, which will include an assessment of the regulatory framework. I will be considering any  recommendations made in relation to these matters  on receipt of that report, which I expect to be finalised  shortly.</p></reply>

Only persons who fulfil one of the following can be considered as an &lsquo;active farmer&rsquo; and will be eligible to receive a direct payment:</p><p>a. A &lsquo;farmer&rsquo; is defined as a person who carries out an agricultural activity such as &lsquo;the rearing or growing of agricultural products including harvesting, milking, breeding animals and keeping animals for farming purposes&rsquo;. </p><p>b. Persons who do not engage in one or more of these activities must at a minimum maintain their land in &lsquo;good agricultural and environmental condition&rsquo;. </p><p>c. Where land can be described as an area &lsquo;naturally kept in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation&rsquo; (marginal land), each Member State must establish a level of &lsquo;minimum activity&rsquo; to be carried out by farmers on such land. As of yet it has not been decided what will constitute a &lsquo;minimum activity&rsquo; but one option is the application of a minimum stocking density. </p><p>In addition, farmers who qualify under the so called Scottish derogation must produce verifiable evidence that in 2013 they <i>&lsquo;produced, reared or grew agricultural products...&rsquo;</i></p><p>  Council Regulation 1782/2003 confined the allocation of entitlements to farmers who received a direct payment in the period 2000-2002. In Ireland&rsquo;s case this resulted in entitlements being allocated to farmers who were paid coupled support under the Suckler Cow Scheme, and/or the Special Beef Premium Scheme, and/or the Slaughter Premium Scheme, and/or the Ewe Premium Scheme and/or the Arable aid scheme. The farming of equines during this original reference period did not attract the allocation of entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme. </p><p>  A similar situation will apply under the new Basic Payment Scheme where the definition of agricultural activity or the production of agricultural products will be taken to apply to the Beef, Sheep and Arable sectors exclusively.

The number of live fish remaining after the storm event was in the order of 20,000.</p><p>  In accordance with the requirements of European Regulation No. 1069/2009 all aquaculture operators are obliged to send mortalities to Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine approved facilities for disposal (e.g. rendering, incineration).  My Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectors carry out routine inspections to ensure compliance with these requirements.</p><p>  Due to the ongoing severe weather conditions that prevailed at the site up to recently no fish mortalities were collected. At the first available opportunity my Department arranged a dive inspection of the area and this took place on the 13<sup>th</sup>  March.  The dive inspection indicated that there were no dead fish present.  I am advised by the Marine Institute however, that where dead fish remain in the bottom of a cage for extended periods (i.e. more than a week or so) they decompose and the bodies of the fish disintegrate making any estimate of numbers difficult. In addition the effects of rough weather and scavengers feeding on the remains will tend to accelerate the disintegration process. </p><p>  My Department continues to keep the position under review.</p></reply>

Matters related to regulation and competition such as this are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the first instance. I would also suggest that if the Deputy has specific information on anti-competitive practices in the beef sector that he brings this to the attention of the Competition Authority. </p><p>  My Department monitors the kill figures from Irish meat plants and I note that that slaughtering of bull beef in the first 11 weeks of 2014 (up to the week ending 16 March) stood at almost 65,000 head which represented an increased kill of almost 2,000 head (3%) over the same period in 2013. In addition the number of live cattle exported to the end of week 10 (week ending 9 March) is approximately 42,000 head which is up 6% over the same period in 2013. This is positive news and belies the perception that there has been a reduction in outlets for slaughter of bull beef or live exports. It should also be noted that Irish beef prices were 106% of the EU average R3 steer price in 2013 and notwithstanding recent fluctuations remain relatively high. The average price change over the first 10 weeks of this year for the benchmark R3 steer is an approximate 1.8% reduction but it must be remembered that it is common for prices to decrease slightly in the first quarter of any year. </p><p>  In relation to the current difficulties between farmers and processors, the Deputy will appreciate that ultimately questions of price and market specification are matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle and it is neither appropriate nor possible for me to intervene directly on these issues. Nonetheless I met with both farmer representatives and processors recently to discuss the current situation. Following that interaction, I have called on the factories, in collaboration with the farming bodies, to resolve the various issues that have lately caused difficulties for some producers. At my request, Meat Industry Ireland (MII) member companies have kept their livestock offices open to deal with farmers with any particular queries or concerns on the marketing of their stock.  MII member companies have made available contact details for each of their main plants to enable farmers to phone them directly.</p><p>  The relationship between processors and farmers is an interdependent one. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. The current situation clearly underlines the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain and to address supply chain issues in such a context. An industry-led solution to the current uncertainty is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.</p></reply>

As the only EU Fisheries Minister to be invited to speak at this prestigious event I spoke to delegates about the importance of seafood for global food security and separately updated delegates on the new reformed EU Common Fisheries Policy which was negotiated to conclusion by the Irish Presidency in 2013. </p><p>  In addition to my role as speaker at the event,  I met with my Norwegian counterpart at the Conference Minister Monica Maeland.  We discussed issues of common interest, including the then ongoing negotiations on North East Atlantic Mackerel which is of such importance to both countries.</p><p>  I was also able, along with BIM, to meet with a number of seafood companies with a view to broadening and deepening cooperation to the mutual benefit of the Norwegian and Irish seafood sectors. Specifically, we explored opportunities for the Irish seafood processing industry and took the opportunity to learn more about Norway&rsquo;s aquaculture industry and how it perceived the future development of the industry.   A key focus throughout my discussions was on encouraging,  wherever possible, new inward investment across the Irish seafood sector. I fully believe there will be considerable benefits for Ireland both from a job creation and investment perspective from my visit to the North Atlantic Seafood Forum.</p></reply>

I have made compensation available to suckler cow farmers who have multiple cases of persistently infected (PI) calves in their herds in order to encourage the early disposal of these calves. The compensation scheme offers these farmers &euro;100 for the second and subsequent calves removed from suckler herds to a knackery.  The compensation is confined to suckler herds because the &ldquo;payback period&rdquo; in these herds is much longer than for dairy herds: it is estimated that the benefit of the eradication of this disease to dairy farmers will exceed the cost involved after a period of 6 months, compared with 12 months for suckler herds. </p><p>  The provision of compensation for calves culled under the compulsory phase of the BVD programme must be placed in the context of the low value of these animals, the economic benefits accruing to farmers arising from the eradication of this disease and, particularly, the short payback time involved for individual farmers as well as the scarce budgetary resources available to my Department.  It has been estimated that the overall benefit of the eradication of this disease is beneficial to farmers in the short to medium term. </p><p>  I have no plans to change the existing compensation arrangements.</p></reply>

These include the provision of slurry storage and animal housing whilst it is also proposed to provide additional grants for new dairy buildings under an enhanced grant scheme for young farmers.   The young farmer scheme will involve a specific grant rate of 60 per cent compared to the standard grant rate of 40 per cent which will be generally available under the other on-farm investment schemes.</p><p>  I would hope to be able to include further details in relation to these grants in the Rural Development Programme itself when it is finalised in the near future.   EU Commission approval for the Programme will be required before any new national measures are introduced on the basis of the Programme.   Accordingly, it is not possible at this stage to fix definitive dates for the introduction of the schemes concerned. </p></reply>

In terms of the performance of the sector in 2013, I am pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew,<i></i>reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 8%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by<i></i>  around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. The market outlook for Irish sheepmeat in 2014 looks reasonably stable as a result of ongoing tight EU sheep supplies and a reduced presence of New Zealand lamb.  Average prices to date this year are almost 6% ahead of 2013.</p><p>  On the export front I intend to drive further the search for new markets in 2014.  My Department in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities. The need for alternative markets as a buffer against market volatility was obvious in the sheep export statistics for 2013.  Because of the economic downturn in the UK and France our exports to those markets dipped but we were able to offset this loss with increased exports to Belgium, Germany and Sweden thereby showing a positive net result for the sector at the end of the year. In addition, veterinary certificates have been agreed with Libya and Singapore, which facilitate the live export of sheep to these destinations. </p></reply>

While there is no regulatory date by which DAS payments must commence, it is generally recognised and indeed acknowledged in the Farmers&rsquo; Charter, that the third week in September of any given year is the earliest feasible payment date, given the volume and complexity of processing involved. To date, payments worth &euro;199.1 million have issued to over 94,000 farmers. </p><p>  Payments continue to issue on a weekly basis, with individual cases being paid the amount due as they are confirmed eligible. It should be appreciated, however, that many applicants, who declare land situated in a Disadvantaged Area are not eligible for payment under the Scheme. Many of these applicants do not maintain any animals and those that do maintain animals do not keep sufficient livestock to meet the minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare. This is a normal feature of the Disadvantaged Area Scheme. </p><p>  Successive EU audits have made it clear that payments should not issue under Area Based schemes, including Single Farm and Disadvantaged Areas, until all queries associated with an application are resolved. </p><p>  The payment position, on a county basis, is as outlined below.  </p><p><b>2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme</b><table><tr><th><div>County </div></th><th><div>Paid</div></th><th><div>Amount</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Carlow</div></td><td><div>697</div></td><td><div>&euro;1,361,659.01</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cavan</div></td><td><div>4,565</div></td><td><div>&euro;9,436,332.32</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Clare</div></td><td><div>5,745</div></td><td><div>&euro;13,008,871.66</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cork</div></td><td><div>6,599</div></td><td><div>&euro;14,518,239.93</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Donegal</div></td><td><div>7,672</div></td><td><div>&euro;17,538,305.11</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Dublin</div></td><td><div>113</div></td><td><div>&euro;247,421.83</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Galway</div></td><td><div>11,143</div></td><td><div>&euro;23,197,259.53</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Kerry</div></td><td><div>7,118</div></td><td><div>&euro;16,776,899.53</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Kildare</div></td><td><div>451</div></td><td><div>&euro;757,654.89</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Kilkenny</div></td><td><div>1,642</div></td><td><div>&euro;3,247,464.83</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Laois</div></td><td><div>1,586</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,987,307.60</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Leitrim</div></td><td><div>3,227</div></td><td><div>&euro;7,043,841.82</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick</div></td><td><div>2,677</div></td><td><div>&euro;4,937,451.36</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Longford</div></td><td><div>2,243</div></td><td><div>&euro;4,647,079.76</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Louth</div></td><td><div>679</div></td><td><div>&euro;1,098,758.96</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Mayo</div></td><td><div>10,694</div></td><td><div>&euro;22,287,185.84</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Meath</div></td><td><div>1,233</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,111,583.49</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Monaghan</div></td><td><div>3,848</div></td><td><div>&euro;7,286,705.46</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Offaly</div></td><td><div>2,228</div></td><td><div>&euro;4,160,916.39</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Roscommon</div></td><td><div>5,361</div></td><td><div>&euro;11,220,481.84</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Sligo</div></td><td><div>3,746</div></td><td><div>&euro;7,836,540.71</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Tipperary</div></td><td><div>4,167</div></td><td><div>&euro;8,394,055.92</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Waterford</div></td><td><div>1,307</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,532,622.30</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Westmeath</div></td><td><div>2,467</div></td><td><div>&euro;4,646,904.11</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wexford</div></td><td><div>1,275</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,213,040.68</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wicklow</div></td><td><div>1,614</div></td><td><div>&euro;3,780,421.60</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This figure is about 10% of the volume of beef which we exported from Ireland to Poland. Typically, beef imports from Poland are made up of lower value manufacturing product or carcass beef, which undergoes some further processing by Irish companies before re-export. Imported Polish beef is generally not destined for the domestic Irish market. For reasons of commercial confidentiality, I am not in a position to identify the companies concerned. </p><p>  Rules on the labelling of meat and meat products are laid down in EU legislation. For beef, the current rules require compulsory origin labelling, with place of birth, rearing and slaughter specified.  There is no evidence to suggest that third country beef is being imported into Ireland and processed and labelled as Irish beef.</p><p>  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each meat plant by my Department. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>  Checks are also conducted at retail level by the Health Service Executive (HSE), working under the aegis of the FSAI which has an overarching supervisory role in relation to labelling matters. </p></reply>

Ultimately it is a matter for farmers in both jurisdictions to decide for themselves where their best advantage lies with regard to buying and selling their animals. In the same way, questions of price and market specification are matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle and it is neither appropriate nor possible for me to intervene directly on these issues. While I do meet and discuss issues of common interest periodically in the North-South Ministerial Council and other fora with Michelle O&rsquo;Neill and other Northern Irish Ministers, it is not within our gift to change or influence the trade in cattle between our jurisdictions.</p><p>I am of course aware that there are difficulties currently in the sale of cattle from here to Northern Ireland because of price differentials arising from constraints brought about by the labelling system operated by the UK retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing there. The retailers&rsquo; long-standing policy is to market UK and Irish beef separately. This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country, thus decreasing the attractiveness of Irish born cattle for Northern Irish meat plants whose customers are large UK retailers. In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcasses have to be deboned in a separate   batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. </p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised the issue of stocking beef from Irish born cattle slaughtered in the UK with British retailers over the years, there are no indications that their marketing policy is likely to be reversed soon. Nevertheless, Bord Bia in its ongoing interactions with British customers will continue to pursue all opportunities, to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.</p></reply>

In general sheep farmers holds low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. </p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2009 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. </p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will experience immediate benefit as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s</p><p>  Initial Unit Value in 2015 will not affect the Linear Cut to the value of existing single payment scheme entitlements in 2014. </p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. </p></reply>

I am aware of the issue raised by the Deputy but I also note that there are relatively few of these calves in the country, as cross-breeding is relatively limited and operated in approximately only 5% of dairy herds. With at least 50% of the progeny being female, this leaves a limited number of male progeny to be sold at marts.</p><p>  I am aware that the issue of cross-breeding in dairy herds has been growing in popularity and is proven to provide cows with high economic value. The downside of this is that the male calves have a low market value due to their unsuitability for beef production. I am hopeful that ongoing efforts by the likes of the ICBF to develop a viable sexed semen sector in the country will help to avoid this issue in the near future.</p></reply>

As you are aware I have recently published a consultation document on the new RDP, which sets out a range of proposed measures for inclusion.</p><p>  The main areas proposed for support in the new RDP are:</p><p>-  a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS. This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers, and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions, </p><p>-   continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now Areas of Natural Constraint), to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year, </p><p>-   incentives for on-farm capital investment, </p><p>-   knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions, </p><p>-   a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd, and</p><p>-   other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming etc.</p><p>  In response to the recent open call for written submissions on the proposed measures, over 120 written submissions were received by the deadline of 19 February. Following examination of these submissions, an ex-ante evaluation incorporating a Strategic Environmental Analysis and an Appropriate Assessment is being carried out on the proposed RDP measures by independent, external evaluators. This process will involve a further stage of stakeholder consultation.</p><p>  In keeping with the timelines agreed at EU level, it is intended to submit a draft of the new RDP to the European Commission in the second quarter of 2014. This draft will then form the basis for detailed discussions over a number of months with the European Commission. </p></reply>

DAS (now to be known as Areas of Natural Constraint) is to be delineated by Member States using soil and climatic criteria, as proposed by the Commission, as follows:</p><p>-   Climate, including Low Temperature and Heat Stress;</p><p>-   Soil, including Drainage, Texture &amp;amp; Stoniness, Rooting Depth and Chemical Properties;</p><p>-   Soil &amp;amp; Climate, including Soil Moisture Balance;</p><p>-   Terrain, including Slope.</p><p>  An area (administrative unit) would be delineated as an area of Natural Constraint, when it meets the proposed threshold set for one of the above criteria only. The Commission are suggesting the delineation be carried out a LAU2 level &ndash; District Electoral Division (DED) in Ireland&rsquo;s case. To qualify under the new system, an area will need to show that at least two-thirds of its utilised agricultural land meets at least one of these criteria.</p><p>  The resultant Areas of Natural Constraint would be subject to a fine-tuning process. These so called Second Stage Criteria are designed to remove areas which, although they meet the biophysical criteria, are deemed to have overcome the natural disadvantage and, therefore, should not benefit under the Scheme. The Second Stage Criteria would not apply to the criteria Low Temperatures, Heat Stress and Slope. The suggested ones for the other criteria are as follows:</p><p>-  Soil Moisture Balance: Fine tune using % of area that is covered by fixed irrigation.</p><p>-  Drainage: Take account of the artificial drainage, which can in effect move soils from one class to another.</p><p>-  Texture and Stoniness, Rooting depth and Soil Chemical properties: Fine tune using production related indicators.</p><p>  Commencement of the process must firstly await finalisation of the Teagasc innovative Irish Soil Information System (ISIS), which is designed to complete the national soil survey and which is scheduled for completion in late 2014. On completion of ISIS the necessary comprehensive delineation may initially commence to see which land is included and excluded as Areas of Natural Handicap. Under the CAP Reform agreement, Member States have until 2018 to introduce a new regime.  </p></reply>

As a contracting state under the Hague Convention, the Adoption Act 2010 provides that adoptions by Irish prospective adoptive parents may be made subject to Irish and Indian requirements being satisfied  in line with relevant laws and the provisions of the Hague Convention. It is a matter for contacting states whether they wish to impose restrictions on whether and how inter-country adoptions of citizens of that State may be effected.</p><p>  I recently facilitated a meeting between the Irish India Support Group and the Adoption Authority in order to provide prospective adopters up to date information on the status of adoptions from India. At this meeting the Adoption Authority advised that there remains a general moratorium by the Indian Central Authority (CARA) on India accepting adoption applications from other countries other than in special circumstances. The Authority has recently received an announcement from CARA that India is currently accepting packs from non-resident Indian prospective adoptive parents for the adoption of Indian children (&ldquo;normal&rdquo; category). This means that India remains closed to non-Indian prospective adoptive parents at this time in respect of what it terms  &ldquo;normal&rdquo; categories of children. The Adoption Authority understands that CARA is accepting applications in respect of children which are termed &quot;special needs&quot;, which includes children over five years of age and sibling groups. The Authority is currently attempting to establish from CARA a possible time frame for the acceptance of application packs in the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; category from non-Indian nationals.</p><p>  The Adoption Authority has advised it is their position that it is necessary to have an Irish registered accredited body to facilitate inter-country adoptions from India in order to safeguard the process for the child and the adoptive parents.  The Authority has recently decided to delegate its functions under Articles 15, 16 and 17 of the Hague Convention to Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency with regard to adoptions from India. Helping Hands is awaiting approval by CARA in order to proceed in this regard.</p><p>  I have arranged a follow-up meeting with the Irish India Support Group and the Adoption Authority in May in order to update the group on progress made.</p></reply>

Following my invitation to the Russian Ministry of Education and Science in August 2013 , a delegation of Russian officials travelled to Ireland in October 2013 for discussions on a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation. The meeting of the 22nd October 2013 was very positive and detailed discussions took place between the Russian officials and officials from my Department, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the  HSE.  At the meeting significant progress was made and my Department, in early November 2013,  forwarded to the Russian side further detailed proposals based on the discussions which took place. Following this my Department prepared revised draft wording on a number of specific points which were recently forwarded to the Russian Authorities. In transmitting these revisions to the Russian authorities it was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.</p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April of 2012 was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasibility and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement. The Authority has also sought and received advice on the legal compatibility of Irish adoption law with that of Ethiopia. The AAI legal advisors have considered this advice and certain clarifications are being sought. The Authority is also trying to establish the position of the Ministry of Women's Affairs in Ethiopia with regard to the desire of the Ethiopian authorities to entering into talks in relation to a bilateral agreement with Ireland.  The Authority will advise me of the position when all the information is available. It is not possible to provide a timeframe for when the Authority's deliberations will be finished. While Ethiopia is striving to improve its child welfare and adoption procedures, it has not yet reached a stage where intercountry adoptions, if re-commenced could be guaranteed to be ethical or legally sound.</p><p>  PQ 13095 makes reference to intercountry adoption with Nigeria. As Nigeria has not ratified the Hague Convention a bilateral agreement would be necessary in order for intercountry adoptions to take place. There are no plans in this regard.</p><p>  The Adoption Authority is currently engaging with a number of Hague countries, such as China, India, the USA, Bulgaria, Thailand and the Philippines and is currently seeking to expand the number of Hague countries with which it engages.</p></reply>

The CCS programme provides funding to community childcare not-for-profit services to enable them to charge reduced childcare rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low to middle incomes.</p><p>  Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The objective of the funding provided under the programme is to ensure that disadvantaged and low income families can have access to quality childcare support.  Parents qualifying for subvention support can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge.  The weekly difference between the subvention support and overall cost, which should include all costs associated with providing the service, must be met by the parent.  As the CCS is a specifically targeted programme, there is no provision to provide additional funding over and above that generated by the parental profiles.  There is no other funding available to my Department to fund the event outlined by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, provides a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.

A Special Care Unit provides secure residential services to children and young people who are in need of specialised targeted intervention. Children are detained in special care if their behaviour is deemed to pose a risk to themselves. The detention, by order of the High Court of a child in a Special Care Unit is considered as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, and when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable.</p><p>  When a decision has been made to make an application for Special Care, the Social Worker submits an application with supporting documentation to the National Special Care Admission and Discharge Committee.  The application will contain up-to-date information, the circumstances surrounding the real and substantive risk to the child and details of the discharge plan with the proposed onward placement of the child.  The Committee will examine the application against the <i>Criteria for Admission to Special Care and Guidance Applying for a Placement in Special Care</i>   (2012).</p><p>  I am advised by the Child and Family Agency that there were 14 applications for admission to Special Care to date in 2014.  Eight of these were approved, one did not meet the criteria for admission and there are five applications under consideration.  The Committee has had five emergency meetings to date in 2014. There have been no appeals considered by the Appeals Panel so far this year.</p><p>  In 2013 there were 104 applications for admission to Special Care.  Thirty two of these were approved, 45 did not meet the criteria for admission and a further 27 applications were withdrawn.  There were 33 emergency meetings of the Committee in 2013. Twenty two appeals, 10 of which were upheld were considered by the Appeals Panel in 2013.</p><p>  In 2012 there were 65 applications for admission to Special Care.  Thirty seven of these were approved, 19 did not meet the criteria for admission and a further 9 applications were withdrawn.  There were 25 emergency meetings of the Committee in 2012.  Five appeals, 3 of which were upheld were considered by the Appeals Panel in 2012.</p></reply>

Given the legislative framework utilised to manage the interaction between the Child Care Act 1991 and the Health Act 2007, in relation to special care provisions, Regulations under the Health Act 2007 are required in advance of the commencement of these various sections.</p><p>  Work is at an advanced stage in my Department in drafting the required Regulations for Special Care Units. I would hope to have the Regulations finalised in the near future, and shortly thereafter to draft a commencement order for the relevant sections of the 2011 Act.</p><p>  Other sections of the Act that are not yet in force are being kept under review as to their commencement in association with relevant policy and service developments.</p></reply>

Since this date the staff of the former NEWB, including its Educational Welfare Officers, have transferred to the new Agency.</p><p>  Within the Child and Family Agency, the statutory Education Welfare Service (EWS) has specific responsibility for the Agency&rsquo;s general function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Agency has advised me that   the details of Educational Welfare Officers in Dublin who are on maternity leave, sick leave or any other form of leave, their locations and whether they have been replaced, are as follows:<table><tr><th>Leave type</th><th>Number of EWOs</th><th>Location</th><th>Replaced</th></tr><tr><td>Maternity</td><td>3</td><td>1 - Dublin 24<br /><br />1 - Dublin 8 and Dublin 2<br /><br />1 - Dublin 13</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Sick leave</td><td>1</td><td>Dublin 15</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Parental Leave (full time)</td><td>1</td><td>Dublin 8 and Dublin 10</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Secondment</td><td>1</td><td>Dublin 12</td><td>No</td></tr></table>  To ensure continuity of service and a targeted approach to areas and cases of greatest need, all locations where a leave event exists receive a service provided by the Senior Educational Welfare Officer, responding to the most critical situations where children are out of school or have no place.   I have requested further details from the Agency of any plans that may exist to provide additional cover for such temporary leave events.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency will deliver an integrated approach to educational welfare services through the continued reform of work practices in its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service; Home School Community Liaison Programme (402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (&euro;24.756m in funding provided to support 124 school cluster projects and related initiatives). This integrated model of service is designed to provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools.</p><p>  The decision by Government to amalgamate the NEWB and its services into the new Child and Family Agency broadens the focus of the Agency and tackles educational welfare as a key outcome for children in its own right and as a positive contributor to other outcomes. It will provide opportunities for more effective working amongst the range of professionals involved in directly supporting children and their families.</p></reply>

In 2013, the total number of adoptions registered in the Register of Intercountry Adoptions, including adoptive parents habitually resident both in Ireland and abroad, was 141. The total for 2012 was 242 and the total for 2011 was 342.</p><p>  The legal framework required by the Adoption Act, 2010, which brought into effect the Hague Convention, has created a much lengthier and robust framework for regulating intercountry adoption. This includes a number of steps to ensure the integrity of the adoption process such as the placement and referral process.</p><p>  In line with its obligations under the Hague Convention and the Adoption Act 2010, the Adoption Authority must ensure that international standards of best practice are applied to its operations, including compliance with the requirement for full, free and informed consent by birth parents and respect for the principle of subsidiarity in intercountry adoptions. The Authority is also mindful of Ireland&rsquo;s responsibilities under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has been ratified by Ireland and includes among other safeguards in Article 21 the necessity for the principle of &lsquo;subsidiarity&rsquo;, whereby intercountry adoption is seen as a measure to be considered only after other suitable alternatives to place a child in his or her own country have been exhausted.</p><p>  It is a fact throughout Hague Convention contracting states that there has been a significant decline in recent years in the number of children available for adoption as average wealth has grown and standards of child protection safeguards have improved in countries which would previously have placed large numbers of children for adoption. This is a welcome development for children who are now being cared for in their own countries, often by extended family members. For comparison purposes, the total number of children adopted into the top twelve receiving states in 2004 was 43,142. In 2011, this figure had dropped to 21,911 &ndash; a drop of 50%. A significant decrease in the number of children being made available for intercountry adoption by their country of origin has obvious consequences in terms of the ease or otherwise with which intercountry adoptions can be effected by prospective adoptive parents in Ireland.</p><p>  I am advised by the Adoption Authority that it remains absolutely committed to facilitating and recognising intercountry adoptions to the extent that children become available for adoption outside their own country and where all relevant legal requirements are fulfilled. To this end, the Authority is currently engaging with the Central Authorities in a number of countries including, India, China, USA, Bulgaria, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.</p></reply>

The Petitioner was unsuccessful in her petition to the High Court challenging the Provisional Referendum Certificate issued on foot of the Children's Referendum.  The Court dismissed the petition and the Petitioner&rsquo;s Counsel made an application to the Supreme Court for a priority appeal hearing date.  The Supreme Court granted this application and the Hearing date is to be advised.</p><p>  The Petitioner had also challenged, by way of plenary proceedings, the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Referendum Act 1994. The Court Hearing of these proceedings was held in December 2013 and the judgment is awaited.</p><p>  I would point out that the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, passed by the Oireachtas in December 2013, makes provision relating to the best interests and views of the child in the performance of the Agency's functions.</p><p>  The General Scheme and Heads of Bill of the proposed Adoption (Amendment) Bill was published in September 2012 in conjunction with the publication of the referendum proposal to inform the public of proposed changes to adoption law envisaged if the Constitutional amendment was approved.</p><p>  The provisions of the proposed Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 will change the criteria, applicable under section 54 of the 2010 Act, under which the High Court may authorise the making of an adoption order without parental consent, in the case of a child who is in the care of prospective adopters and where that child&rsquo;s birth parents have failed in their parental duty to the child. The Bill will also provide for the voluntary placement for adoption of any child irrespective of the marital status of his or her parents.</p><p>  It is my intention to bring the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible, following conclusion of all proceedings and processes relevant to the Children&rsquo;s Referendum.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister for Justice and Equality recently published the General Scheme of a Children and Family Relationships Bill.  As the Minister stated in the press release which he issued in that connection, the proposals in the General Scheme seek to ensure our law reflects the principles, rights and obligations contained in Article 42A -  if upheld - of the Constitution.</p></reply>

There are a number of general policy questions around the nature of our adoption regime and I consider it timely to consider a review of adoption.  Given the range and complexity of the issues this will require scoping and preliminary examination after which decisions will be made on the extent and time scale for the review to see if proposals for legislative change emerge from this review or the nature of such proposals.  Based upon the many domestic and international legal aspects to adoption the issue of further legislative development will certainly be considered. This review will inform future operational and legislative considerations regarding the Adoption Act, 2010.  For the present, however, my legislative priority in the area of adoption is the preparation of  information and tracing legislation.  In addition, my Department is also working closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence on the draft Children and Family Relationships Bill, which it is proposed will contain measures in relation to adoption by civil partners.</p></reply>

This area of services, representing a very small number of children in care, is also the most challenging. The report outlined the importance of good care planning and the availability of special placements for children who need them. The findings of the report show the need for improved assessment, care planning and early access to therapy for children with high level needs.</p><p>  A number of recommendations for both the Child and Family Agency and my Department are included in the report. It is worth noting that there has already been progress in a number of these areas in recent years, with further work currently underway.</p><p>  The new Child and Family Agency, which was established on January 1<sup>st</sup> brings a dedicated focus to child protection/welfare and family supports; to oversee further service developments and reforms. A new service delivery framework has been introduced involving a national approach to case assessment and management. Children and families identified as having welfare needs can be quickly diverted to family support services, allowing social workers to assess and respond to child protection concerns in a timely fashion. A new streamlined management system and quality assurance framework is being also implemented by the Agency.</p><p>  The Agency is developing a  National Child Protection Notification System, which will give social workers, emergency departments and Garda&iacute; timely access to information on child protection history. The National Child Care Information System, to manage information on children in care, is now at implementation phase and being rolled-out by the Agency. A comprehensive strategic plan for residential care is also being developed by the Agency.  A new supervision policy for social work staff was implemented in 2013.</p><p>  National Standards for Child Protection &amp;amp; Welfare Services were published in 2012. The Health Information and Quality Authority commenced inspection of the HSE Child and Family Social Work Services against these standards in late 2012 and inspections of these services in the Agency are continuing.</p><p>  The Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group is continuing to support the on-going implementation of Children First; with legislation to place aspects of Children First guidance on a statutory foot to be published shortly.</p><p>  The Ombudsman's report also found that multiple placements were a feature in some of the 10 cases described in the report. I note that in December 2012, 172 children (2.7 % of children in care) had experienced three or more placements in the previous year.  The comparable rate for England and Wales stands at 10% per annum.</p><p>  It is imperative that to be successful in improving the delivery of children&rsquo;s services that lessons are learned from the past and recommendations are implemented.  The wide ranging reform programme that has been undertaken to date and continues in the  Child and Family Agency will address many of the problems highlighted in this report.</p></reply>

The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced rates to qualifying low income and disadvantaged families who need to access after-school services.  A new School Age Childcare programme was recently introduced and makes available 600 after-school places which targets social welfare recipients availing of employment opportunities.</p><p>  The provision of quality after-school services is a priority for my Department and I recently brought forward legislative changes to the Child Care Act that will allow for the introduction of new after-school regulations. These regulations are currently being drafted and I expect that the final draft will provide a legislative framework to support the delivery of a more co-ordinated and quality after school service in this country.</p></reply>

Following this my Department prepared revised draft wording on a number of specific points which were forwarded to the Russian Authorities in February of this year.

It also briefed the adoption support groups on its intentions in this regard.  The Authority has been dealing with callers throughout the transition period and has sought to explain in an empathetic way the direction which the adoption process was taking and has also endeavoured to keep them updated on any significant developments.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Adoption Authority of Ireland is a regulatory body whose statutory functions are prescribed by legislation and while the Authority is always mindful of the stresses and emotional issues which face prospective adoptive parents, it is not charged with the responsibility of counselling applicants on adoption matters. This task would be seen as part of the assessment and follow up process provided by the Child and Family Agency. However, the Authority does have a number of professional Social Workers among its staff who can be called upon, when necessary to deal with those applicants who require professional support.</p></reply>

The new scheme was announced in February 2013.</p><p>  Pobal assisted my Department with the application and evaluation process for the programme.</p><p>  Applications for new youth caf&eacute;s were invited from organisations and consortia involved in the provision of services to young people, with at least 3 years&rsquo; experience in the development of youth services. It was a requirement of the scheme that applications were to be submitted &lsquo;online&rsquo; by 12 April, 2013. Detailed guidelines on the application and appraisal process and supporting documents in relation to best practice for youth cafes was made available to applicants on the Pobal website.</p><p>  Some 95 applications for support under this scheme were received by Pobal.</p><p>  To be eligible, applications were required to demonstrate that the proposed new youth caf&eacute; would be developed in line with my Department&rsquo;s Youth Cafes in Ireland: a Best Practice Guide; that the facility would be a target service for 12 &ndash; to 25 year olds and  aim to meet the needs of the local youth population, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  Criteria also included the extent to which the proposed new youth caf&eacute; would add value to existing provision for young people in a locality, the capacity of the organisers to effectively manage the project, the involvement of youth in the development of project, how the project would be sustainable and the strength of the overall proposal.</p><p>  Eligible applications were then appraised on the basis of a detailed assessment of the extent to which the criteria were met. The applications that scored well in the initial process with Pobal were further evaluated in the Department taking account of youth population, existing youth service provision and geographic considerations. Following the completion of the assessment and evaluation process some 30 proposals for new youth cafes projects were approved for funding and for inclusion in the next phase of the youth caf&eacute; programme.  These successful applicants have now entered the pre-contracting development stage and are working with Pobal to progress their projects in this regard.</p><p>  Details of the successful projects are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dcya.gov.ie.</p><p>  I have been advised that the application from the group in question did not score sufficiently high in the evaluation process to be included in the list of successful projects. Should the group wish to contact Pobal, arrangements can be made to provide comprehensive feedback on their application under the scheme.</p><p>  I have arranged for a copy of the detailed guidelines on the application and appraisal process provided to all applicants to be sent to the Deputy.</p></reply>

We will improve the quality of the pre-school year by implementing standards and reviewing training options.</td><td>In addition to maintaining the free pre-school year, Budget 2014 provided &euro;4.5m to improve the quality of pre-school services through: a Learner Fund to assist existing staff meet the new qualification requirements being introduced in September 2015; the establishment of a Quality Support Service which will assist services in implementing Siolta and Aistear; and the recruitment of additional Early Years Inspectors to strengthen the existing inspection regime.<br /><br /><br />A re-focus of funding in 2014 will allow participants in Community Employment to avail of the (afterschool) child-care places.</td></tr><tr><td>3.32.11</td><td>We will end the practice of sending children to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</td><td>Following the announcement in 2013 that St. Patrick's Institution was to close, all sentenced 17 year olds and the 18-20 year old population of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution have now been transferred to the Wheatfield Place of Detention.  The only children now remaining at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution are 17 year olds who are remanded in custody pending trial.  They continue to be detained in a dedicated unit pending their transfer to Oberstown.  Construction is underway on the new &euro;56.4 million facility at Oberstown with the first three new residential units to be available in the third quarter of 2014, which will be used to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for the 17 year olds.</td></tr><tr><td>4.1.1</td><td>We will fundamentally reform the delivery of child protection services by removing child welfare and protection from the HSE and creating a dedicated Child Welfare and Protection Agency, reforming the model of service delivery and improving accountability to the D&aacute;il.</td><td>The Child &amp;amp; Family Agency was established with effect from 1 January 2014, putting in place a new regime of governance and accountability for child and family services. The Agency has a dedicated remit for child welfare, protection and family support services and involves the merging of Child and Family services from the HSE with Family Support Agency and National Education Welfare Board services. The Agency has a budget of over &euro;600 million and a staff of 4,000, and represents one of the largest single public sector reforms undertaken by Government.</td></tr><tr><td>4.1.2</td><td>We are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Ryan Report including putting the Children First Guidelines on a statutory footing and legislating for the use of &ldquo;soft information&rdquo;.</td><td>The general scheme of the new legislation to put the Children First Guidelines on a statutory footing has been published. This will place obligations on professionals and organisations working with children to report suspected child protection concerns, to share information and to engage in inter-agency and multi-disciplinary working. <br /><br /><br />The forthcoming National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework 2014-2018 will meet one of the key recommendations of the Ryan Report to bring together relevant policies including those relating to prevention and early intervention initiatives, early childhood education, area based approaches to address child poverty, and addressing youth homelessness and aftercare provision.</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Cross Departmental Commitments</b><table><tr><th>PfG Ref:</th><th>Commitment  &ndash;  Department of Children and Youth Affairs                                </th><th>PfG Annual Report 2014  &ndash;  DCYA Update</th></tr><tr><td>3.37.5<br /><br />Listed under PfG Cross - Departmental commitments &ndash; DCYA has lead responsibility</td><td>A new approach is needed to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched. We will adopt a new area based approach to child poverty, which draws on best international practice and existing services to tackle every aspect of child poverty. Initially, this model will be rolled out to up to ten of Ireland&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities, in cooperation with philanthropic partners to co-fund and manage the project.</td><td>Following a call for proposals and an assessment process, a further ten areas around the country have<br /><br />been admitted into the design phase of the Area Based Childhood Programme.

Such arrangements are a private contractual matter between the patient and the care provider(s).</p><p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine (Fampyra&reg;) in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.</p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (  ).  The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.</p><p>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure which will provide a GP service to approximately 240,000 children that must currently pay to see a GP.</p><p>  The implementation of this new service requires primary legislation and work on preparing this is ongoing.  Preparations are also proceeding in relation to the necessary administrative arrangements. Details of application procedures and the start date for the new service will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.  As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department. This review is due to commence in April 2014 and will be completed by December 2014.</p><p>  The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, &quot;Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth&quot; (FACCT).  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007.  In addition, a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) will commence shortly.</p><p>  The Forum on Fluoridation, established in 2000, reviewed the policy of water fluoridation and recommended in 2002 that it should continue as a public health measure.  In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. </p><p>  Annual expenditure in recent years which includes operational costs, capital costs and the supply of hydrofluorosilicic acid has been in the region of &euro;3.5 million - &euro;4 million.</p></reply>

One of the objectives of Regulation 883/04 is to ensure that persons exercising their right to move and to stay freely within these areas do not suffer disadvantages in accessing or paying for healthcare.  The Regulation is binding on all Member States and does not allow for any discretion in establishing entitlement.</p><p>  As a general rule, public healthcare is provided according to the legislation of the country of residence as if the individual were insured in that country.  The cost of this public healthcare is the responsibility of the State to which social security system the individual is linked.  Therefore, a pensioner in receipt of a qualifying pension in a Member State, who is residing in another Member State, is entitled to access public healthcare on the same basis as persons who are insured with and resident in the Member State of residence, provided that he/she is not subject to the social security legislation in that Member State of residence  <i>. </i></p><p>  The implementation of a system of universal health insurance will not affect the requirement for Ireland to continue to comply with EU Regulations in this regard.</p></reply>

Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of healthcare delivery.  A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors of blood and the recipients of blood and blood products. </p><p>  The EU Directive on quality and safety of blood requires that &quot;all necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the health of individuals who are recipients of blood and blood components&quot;.  The permanent deferral of men who have sex with men [MSM] from donating blood is not based on sexuality or orientation but on the fact that there are increased levels of HIV infection among men who have sex with men in Ireland.   </p><p>  The IBTS' decisions are evidence-based and, in making decisions, it reviews the data that are available in Ireland from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and from other sources internationally.  The most recent full year for which data are available from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre is 2012.  In 2012, 341 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in Ireland.  The highest proportion of new diagnoses, 166 (48.7%) was in MSM.  This proportion has been increasing since 2004.  Full year data for 2013 is not yet available but the data for the first two quarters of 2013 show rates similar to 2012.  These rates of HIV infection in MSM are disproportionately high, considering that MSM account for a much smaller proportion of the population.  </p><p>  The IBTS keeps its eligibility criteria for donating under regular  review.  It also works closely with blood services internationally and keeps developments in this area under review.</p></reply>

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for a medical card.  The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner.  The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card. Under the legislation, there is no entitlement to a medical card based on having a particular disease or illness (nor has there been previously).  However, if an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis. Where persons submit an application, as a new applicant or a renewal review, without additional medical documentation and are refused, they will receive a letter giving a calculation of the guideline thresholds and where these have been exceeded.  Also, at this stage, they are informed of the option to furnish further medical documentation, to demonstrate medical expenditure related to an illness or disease, in support their application.  The HSE has a panel of Community Medical Officers to assist in the processing of applications for medical cards on a discretionary basis, where the income guidelines are exceeded but where there are difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness or physical disability.</p><p>  Where discretion is exercised with regard to an applicant with an illness or disease, it is the medical costs of that condition on a person's financial situation that is relevant to the assessment for a medical card.  In accordance with the legislation, it is not possible to award a medical card by virtue of an illness or a disease or the severity thereof.  The HSE does not record, on the GMS database, the medical conditions of an individual and, therefore, it is not possible to state whether persons with a medical condition did not qualify for a medical card.</p><p>  All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility. This review process is applied across all medical card holders, and is not targeted at condition specific groups.</p></reply>

This policy is reflected in the significant investment and changes that we have brought to Mental Health since 2012 and covers the provision of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).  The implementation of that policy includes CAMHS Teams, in-patient care, and development of forensic mental health services for children.<i></i></p><p><i>  A Vision for Change</i> envisages 99 multi-disciplinary teams to provide acute secondary mental health care for children in the community, including hospital liaison and day hospital services.  There are now 61 CAMHS teams in place, compared to 54 in 2008. It also recommends the provision of 80 Child and Adolescent psychiatric in-patient beds.  In 2008 there were 16 such beds, while now there are 51 beds operational nationally<b>,</b> with more planned.  Further capacity will be available with the completion of the CAMHS Forensic Unit as part of developing the National Forensic Mental Health Service, and the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  To underpin the new initiatives approved to-date, around 230 new posts were allocated to CAMHS Teams over 2012-13, and recruitment of these is well underway.  More CAMHS posts are due to come on-stream over the course of this year.</p><p>  A Vision for Change (paragraph 10.12) recognises the needs of children requiring special consideration, including children in care.  It recommends that the primary support for these children should be provided by the psychological  services in community care or by the local Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Team, where specialist care is required.  The needs of such children would be decided and, where necessary, prioritised following professional assessment.  In circumstances where children are placed in a HSE area outside of their own locality, and the criteria governing these cases, I have referred this matter to the Executive for direct reply to the Deputy, as the Executive has operational responsibility in such cases.</p></reply>

The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation, which I expect to be published shortly.</p><p>  I am satisfied that there is ample evidence to suggest that access to primary care services helps to improve health outcomes, to prevent the development of chronic conditions and to effect savings in the acute hospital sector.</p><p>  The Report of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy recommended that all children under the age of six years should be given access to free GP care.  The Trinity College Centre for Health Policy and Management and the Adelaide Hospital Society report entitled <i>Social Health Insurance: Further Options for Ireland</i>, noted that internationally there are strong grounds for providing free health care for children, particularly given their burden of ill health.   </p><p>  A draft contract for the provision of free GP care to children under six years, is currently the subject of a consultation process.  I would wish to emphasise that the document is a draft and I have no doubt that there will be changes to the text following the consultation process.  I have offered to meet with the GP organisations in the coming weeks for more detailed discussions on the scope and content of the draft contract.  This will afford them the fullest opportunity to raise any and all issues which they may have regarding the draft contract.  Furthermore, I wrote to the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) on 27<sup>th</sup>   February 2014, stating that the Department and the HSE are fully prepared to engage meaningfully with them and are prepared to negotiate with them on all aspects of the scope and content of the proposed contract.  However, the ultimate setting of fees must remain a matter for the Minister for Health, though there will be an opportunity for their input on the fee structure, which it is proposed to address by means of a separate consultation process.  The IMO has been formally invited to meet with the Department and the HSE to commence this process.</p><p>  With reference to the question which infers that the draft contract is placing a &ldquo;gagging order&rdquo; on GPs, the specific clause in the draft contract relating to this (Clause 28.4.4) is intended to reflect and be protective of the HSE's interests given that the primary statutory obligations to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services will rest with the HSE.  It is not in any sense intended to impose unwarranted or inappropriate restrictions on individual GP contractors in advocating on behalf of their patients.  A similar clause can be found in the form of agreement with Clinical Dental Technicians, which was introduced in 2011.  The clause in question should be viewed in the context of the entire draft document, where the intent is to balance the duties, obligations and rights of both parties, while at the same time, having due regard to the overriding statutory obligations that will rest with the HSE.</p><p>  Under the existing contract, GPs contracted under the General Medical Services Scheme must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them (or a locum/deputy) for emergencies outside normal practice hours.  Co-operatives provide an ideal facility to enable GPs to discharge this obligation.  The draft under six contract also makes provision for GP out-of-hours services, the details of which I expect will be the subject of further discussions with the GPs.  I would wish to state again that no decision has been taken on the rates of fees payable to GPs for services included in the draft under six contract, including out-of-hours payments.  These will be addressed through the fee setting process outlined above. </p><p>  The Deputies' questions raise a number of other specific issues, including disease surveillance and health promotion.  Such activities will ensure that the proposed scope of service under the contract is not limited to &ldquo;diagnosis and treatment&rdquo; but will include participation in active health promotion, disease surveillance, prevention and appropriate management of chronic conditions.  I expect that issues such as these and the regularity of performance reviews will be the subject of further discussions with the GPs.</p></reply>

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for a medical card. The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner. The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card. Under the legislation, there is no entitlement to a medical card based on having a particular disease or illness (nor has there been previously).  However, if an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis. Where persons submit an application, as a new applicant or a renewal review, without additional medical documentation and are refused, they will receive a letter giving a calculation of the guideline thresholds and where these have been exceeded. Also, at this stage, they are informed of the option to furnish further medical documentation, to demonstrate medical expenditure related to an illness or disease, in support their application. The HSE has a panel of Community Medical Officers to assist in the processing of applications for medical cards on a discretionary basis, where the income guidelines are exceeded but where there are difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness or physical disability.</p><p>  Where discretion is exercised with regard to an applicant with an illness or disease, it is the medical costs of that condition on a person's financial situation that is relevant to the assessment for a medical card.  In accordance with the legislation, it is not possible to award a medical card by virtue of an illness or a disease or the severity thereof.</p><p>  The National Assessment Guidelines for a medical card or  GP visit card state that the &lsquo;exercise of discretion by the HSE, in favour of the applicant, should be considered where meeting the costs of services covered by a medical card or a GP visit card compromises the applicant&rsquo;s or his/her family&rsquo;s ability to meet reasonable expenditure.  </p><p>  The HSE will give consideration to a range of medical or social factors that present on an application in deciding whether to approve a medical card on grounds of &quot;undue hardship&quot; or &quot;unduly burdensome&quot;, having regard to the applicant's overall financial situation, in the arranging of GP services by the applicant for himself/herself and dependants.</p><p>  The decision maker may make appropriate inquires or seek advice from other sources to assist with coming to a decision on the applicant's overall financial &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo;, including the applicant&rsquo;s doctor, Social Worker, Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)  and the HSE&rsquo;s Medical Officers.</p><p>  I trust the above reply outlines the circumstances, in addition to income, taken into account in deciding whether to approve medical card eligibility on discretionary grounds. More detailed information is contained in the HSE's Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines, which are available from the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service.</p></reply>

The level of resources needed to provide for the complex care and treatment needs of this patient group is significantly higher than for patients who have a certain level of mobility or independence.  The treatment of these patients can often be extended beyond the normal length of stay. The National Rehabilitation Hospital actively manages the waiting time for admission to the high intensity rehabilitation beds.</p><p>  The Government has committed to part funding a 120 Bed Rehabilitation Unit with Integrated Therapy spaces to replace the existing National Rehabilitation Hospital, at an estimated total cost of &euro;54 million. In the past couple of years an additional four new Consultants in Rehabilitation Medicine were appointed to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in addition to the existing seven Consultants at the hospital.</p><p>  The HSE has made commitments in the 2014 Operational Plan to progressing the implementation of the Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy.  A Steering Group has been established to guide the implementation of the Strategy and to ensure adequate links with the Clinical Rehabilitation Medicine Programme. </p></reply>

If a person does not return their review form within the time specified, their continuing eligibility cannot be confirmed and their medical card/GP visit card cannot be reissued. In these circumstances, or where the review process establishes that a person no longer holds eligibility, the eligibility ceases.</p><p>  Persons are requested to return their completed review forms, at least one month in advance of the due expiry date of their existing eligibility in order to give the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and/or to get back to the person if the application is incomplete or requires any further details to be provided. </p><p>  A person (and their dependants, if it applies), the subject of a medical card/GP visit card eligibility review assessment, will continue to have their eligibility extended pending the outcome of a review assessment, provided:</p><p>  1. they have returned their review form within the time specified, and</p><p>  2. are engaging with the HSE in enabling their review assessment to complete. </p><p>  Outside of the date period three months prior to the expiry date of a person&rsquo;s current approved eligibility, the HSE reserves the right, when appropriate, to undertake a review at any other time to confirm a person&rsquo;s eligibility. Instances where such reviews might be occasioned include but are not confined to: following on from a change to the schemes qualifying eligibility criteria, notified changes to a person&rsquo;s circumstances that may affect continuing eligibility, random reviews asking that a card holder confirm &lsquo;ordinary residence&rsquo; in Ireland.</p><p>  Approximately 10,000 letters are issued each month to cardholders asking that they sign and return to the HSE a Declaration of Residency form.  On receipt of this Declaration, eligibility to the GMS Scheme continues. If a person does not return the Declaration of Residency form, their eligibility ceases.</p><p>  The Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) (NO. 2) Act 2013 with effect from 18th   December 2013 provides for the reduction in the Persons age 70 or older medical card income qualifying thresholds to &euro;500 gross income per week for a single person and &euro;900 gross income per week for a couple. The HSE is required to identify those persons who no longer have full eligibility as a result of this change and in place of the medical card issue a GP visit card to those with gross income up to &euro;700 (single person) /&euro;1,400 (couple) per week. Those persons aged 70 or older with gross income above &euro;700/&euro;1,400 per week will have no eligibility to either a medical card or a GP Visit Card. This assessment review process has commenced and 6,000 review letters have been issued to customers. </p><p>  The HSE is now completing medical card reviews for approximately 86,000 individuals per month. It is expected that increased data sharing between Revenue, Department of Social Protection and the HSE has the potential to further reduce the level of documents and information required from families as their eligibility status is reviewed.</p></reply>

Staff of these organisations are classified as public servants and set rates of remuneration apply.

The contract between the HSE and GPs under the GMS Scheme stipulates that fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences".  Consultation fees charged by general practitioners to private patients and to GMS patients outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.

As a result, the nursing resource in Letterkenny General Hospital will be restructured, delivering benefits to both children and adults with Diabetes.  The current resource of two Clinical Nurse Specialist posts and one Staff Nurse post in the Diabetic service at Letterkenny General Hospital will remain unchanged.  One of the two hospital Clinical Nurse Specialist posts will have a focus on children with diabetes and the other will have a focus on adults with diabetes.  The existing midwifery allocation to support pregnant women with diabetes will also continue unchanged.  The new post of Integrated Diabetes Clinical Nurse Specialist is an additional resource which will link hospital-based diabetic services to community-based diabetic care services.  This role is an essential resource in empowering patients to achieve optimum diabetes control by utilising clinically sound collaborative links between primary care and secondary care providers, as envisaged in the National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme developed by the National Clinical Programme for Diabetes.  The outcome of these changes will be that nursing support for children with diabetes within the hospital will remain at current levels.  Overall services will be enhanced through the support of the Integrated Services Clinical Nurse Specialist, who will work across both the hospital and the community.</p><p>  In addition to the enhanced nursing resources outlined above, the hospital is in the process of recruiting permanent Consultants to two vacant posts within the Paediatric service.  One of these posts is being advertised as a Consultant Paediatrician with a Special Interest in Diabetes.  In the interim, Consultant cover for children with diabetes is currently being provided by a locum Consultant Paediatrician.</p></reply>

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following on a ruling of the High Court children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the HSE as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.</p><p>  Although the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is taking a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.  In addition, targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.</p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into integrated multidisciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the implementation of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  This involves the roll-out of a new model of service, the objective of which is to bring about equity and consistency, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their difficulty.  The Programme is a key priority for the HSE in 2014 with an additional &euro;4m allocated to assist in its implementation.</p><p>  My Department has requested the HSE to respond to the Deputy in relation to the detailed data that he has sought on the operation of the assessment process.</p></reply>

The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country.  However, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the necessary statutory provisions to fully implement the Directive and will have them in place as soon as possible.  Nevertheless, there are arrangements in place in respect of the key provision of the Directive in relation to a national contact point (NCP), which has been set up within the HSE and will administer the information and reimbursement aspects of the Directive.  The principal function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost, the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the rights, if any, that they may have through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP will be able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.</p><p>  The Directive allows Irish residents to avail of health care in other EU member states that they would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, and which is not contrary to Irish legislation.  The costs must be born by the individual and he/she then seeks reimbursement for the cost of the healthcare upon return to Ireland.  Costs will only be reimbursed up to the level that would have been arisen if the health care had been provided in Ireland or the actual cost of the healthcare in the other member state, whichever is the lesser.  Where the medical treatment being sought is not available in Ireland, patients may, as at present, apply for the Treatment Abroad Scheme operated by the HSE under EU Regulation 883/04.</p><p>  Regarding the financial implications of the Directive it has not been possible to estimate with a degree of certainty the financial implications of this Directive at a national level.  What can be said is that the majority of patients are expected to choose to be treated in their own member state, for family support, language, cultural and financial reasons (the patient pays the costs of the healthcare under the Directive to his\her provider in their preferred member state and only receives reimbursement on completion of the treatment).  Any estimation is made more difficult in that the experience of cross border health care to date has been limited to that provided to patients under EU Regulation 883/2004, in the form of the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAB), and that with the Directive, there will now be two potential routes for patients to receive planned healthcare in another Member State.  My Department and the HSE will be monitoring the number and cost of reimbursements under these two routes over the next year.</p></reply>

The policy establishes a framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, which seeks to ensure an integrated and quality assured approach in their management, so as to reduce the burden of these conditions.  The implementation of the National Stroke Programme, since 2011 to date has resulted in improved services for stroke patients.  One of the programme's targets was to increase the rate of safe thrombolysis from 3% to 7.5% by the end of 2013.  In 2013 the HSE reported a national stroke thrombolysis rate of 10.5% for the third quarter of that year, which exceeded targets and is comparable to the highest rates internationally.</p><p>  The national 24/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis is progressing, with emergency thrombolysis provided now to patients in all regions of the country, via improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new physicians. available now in 23 hospitals.  As mentioned earlier, significant improvements in thrombolysis rates have been noted as high  as 10/5% in the third quarter of 2013.  The National Stroke Programme is currently planning the second national audit of stroke care, to independently validate data provided via the HIPE system.  The audit will include a review of the organisation of stroke care at hospital level and the outcome of care for the patient. Previous national and international audits of acute stroke care will inform the methods used in order to all for comparison of the findings.</p></reply>

This study reviewed the use of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in a population-based cancer screening programme and compared the results with screen-film mammography.  The study involved 188,823 screening examinations of women aged between 50 and 64 years.  Of these 35,204 (18.6%) were obtained using full field digital mammography (FFDM).  The re-call rate and cancer detection rate of FFDM were compared with results from screen-film mammography.  In this study FFDM gave rise to significantly higher cancer detection and recall rates than screen-film mammography.</p><p>  Digital mammography facilitates enhancement of image quality which is particularly associated with improved visualisation of dense breast tissue.   The improved images lead to higher detection rates for cancer which is seen as a positive.  This facilitates earlier treatment of known cancers.  Digital mammography does not play any part in causing these cancers.</p><p>  Furthermore, digital mammography results in significant reductions in the radiation dose associated with screening examinations and it allows images to be acquired in a shorter time.  It is also possible to manipulate the examination of images from different angles to obtain better detail. </p><p>  A standard protocol for viewing mammograms is routinely used in all the BreastCheck units.  BreastCheck offers a triple assessment approach to diagnosis which involves a combination of clinical examination, additional imagery (mammography or ultrasound) and cytology. The standardised cancer detection ratio is assessed centrally by the Programme Evaluation Unit for the entire BreastCheck programme.  The health of women is at the centre of all aspects of  BreastCheck.  Also BreastCheck provides transparent information to women who are invited for screening - with the benefits and limitations of screening clearly explained.</p><p>  The latest projections from the National Cancer Registry indicate that the incidence of cancer, including breast cancer, in Ireland is expected to rise in the period up to 2040.  They attribute this in the main to demographic changes such as population size and an aging population.  Breast cancer survival in Ireland has improved significantly in recent years due to a combined approach of screening, symptomatic detection and improved treatment.  Breast cancer 5 year survival is now estimated at 81.8% for people diagnosed between 2003-2007, up from 76.8% for people diagnosed between 1998-2002. </p></reply>

I am determined to address costs in this sector in the interest of consumers and I  have made it clear to insurers that I believe significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums. </p><p>  As part of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, I appointed Mr. Pat McLoughlin as Independent Chair to work with insurance companies and the Department to identify effective cost management strategies to help ensure the long-term sustainability of the private health insurance market.  Mr. McLoughlin's first report was published on 26 December 2013 and the second phase report is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks. </p><p>  Many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's web-site www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.  The HIA may also be contacted by 'phone at LoCall 1850 929 166.</p><p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that the Government remains committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance, so that it is affordable for as many people as possible, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to Universal Health Insurance.</p></reply>

These services and supports which are co-ordinated by the HSE National Advocacy Unit are intended to provide that individuals receive tailored assistance to address their specific requirements, where appropriate.  It is acknowledged that treatment and individual medical needs may need to be reassessed over time to take account of changes in their condition or circumstances.  </p><p>  The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to rapid diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis.  Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals to provide advice, information and access to local services.</p><p>  On the education side, the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) engaged with all of the schools being attended by children with narcolepsy to provide guidance and assistance on the condition and the supports available.  These include special education home tuition, the provision of supplemental learning support/resource teaching support on a needs basis and the provision of Special Needs Assistants (SNA) support if required.  Furthermore, reasonable accommodations, including special examination centres and rest breaks were provided for students who sat state exams in last June.  Similar arrangements will be available on a needs basis to students sitting state exams in future years.  The Department of Education and Skills issued circulars providing information to schools on the nature, likely symptoms, possible effect of the condition of narcolepsy on students and the supports available for students.</p><p>  With regard to third level, students diagnosed with narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination can access the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme, which is a college/university scheme which offers enhanced access routes to third level education.</p><p>  All health and educational services and supports will continue to be provided on an ex-gratia basis.  Those services and supports will be reassessed on an ongoing basis to take account of the individual's condition and circumstances.</p></reply>

However, while the situation is avoided where possible, all hospitals must optimise the availability and occupancy of all bed spaces. As a result, there are extenuating circumstances where mixed wards can occur in Emergency Departments, Acute Medical Assessment Units, Intensive Care Units and Coronary Care Units. In these situations best practices are in place to protect the privacy and dignity of patients. The ongoing improvements in ward accommodation and increase in single room accommodation aims to provide appropriate accommodation for all patients.</p><p>  The HSE intends that all  newly built acute hospital in-patient accommodation at new hospital builds, major additions to existing hospitals or major renovations to existing hospital in-patient accommodation areas should be made up entirely of single patient rooms and that all newly built non-acute hospital in-patient accommodation, when included within an acute hospital setting, should be made up of a minimum of 50% single patient rooms.</p></reply>

Following Government approval, the Minister published two reports in May 2013: the Report on <i>The Establishment of Hospital Groups as a transition to Independent Hospital Trusts, </i>and &ldquo;<i>Securing the Future of Smaller Hospitals: a Framework for Development.  </i>The establishment of acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum configuration for hospital services to deliver high quality, safe patient care in a cost effective manner. </p><p>  Seven Hospital Groups have been established on a non-statutory administrative basis as follows: (i) Dublin North East; (ii) Dublin Midlands; (iii) Dublin East; (iv) South/South West; (v) West/North West; (vi) UL Hospitals Group and (vii) Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group.

The HSE  is putting arrangements in place to ensure the appointment of Group CEOs to the two remaining Hospital Groups and the appointment of Group CEOs will be followed by appointments to group management teams.  </p><p>  Each hospital group will be required to develop a strategic plan within one year of establishment.  The plans will describe how they will provide more efficient and effective patient services; reorganise these services to provide optimal care to the populations they serve; and how they will achieve maximum integration and synergy with other groups and all other health services, particularly primary care and community care services.  The strategic plan for the South/South West Hospital Group will build on the significant work already underway in reconfiguring services  in the South.</p></reply>

This will be followed by consultation on the general approach set out in the White Paper and a separate consultation on the future health basket.

In 2012 the HSE completed a prioritisation exercise for all primary care centre locations. In addition to the locations' ranks as a result of the prioritisation exercise, the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors including GP participation. GP commitment to sharing accommodation with HSE staff and delivering health care services from these facilities is essential for primary care centre delivery. Therefore locations cannot proceed unless GPs are prepared to engage in the process.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care centres are also subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available and to successful planning processes. Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic exercise, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.  </p><p>  As with all capital projects the primary care infrastructure programme must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer. There is limited funding available for new projects over the period 2014-2018 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place. The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet needs now and in the future.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.</p><p>  The Irish Government supported the original decision by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) to approve the allocation of EU funding to the Narrow Water bridge project and committed an upfront funding contribution of &euro;3.9 million in January last year.  The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances.  This funding contribution was due to be matched with a contribution from the Northern Ireland authorities in line with the agreed funding ratios for the Programme.  The Government was disappointed that the tender process resulted in a doubling of the initial costs budgeted for by the project partners for the construction of the bridge.  The Government has indicated on many occasions that it would be willing to help to address the shortfall in funding for the Narrow Water Bridge, but this depends entirely on matching contributions from the other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive.  These commitments have not as yet been forthcoming.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the recovery programme that this Government has had to pursue to put the country back on its feet, unfortunately, there is a further reduction in regional and local roads spending in 2014 of over &euro;60 million.  Ultimately it is from this budget that any additional funding from this State would have had to come and we would not have been in a position to provide a further &euro;10 million towards this project as well as to underwrite any potential further overspend.</p><p>  The progression and importance of this project has been discussed at the North South Ministerial Council on a number of occasions most recently on the 8 of November last year.  In the Plenary Joint Communiqu&eacute; issued subsequent to that meeting, it was stated that &quot;Ministers remain supportive of the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge and have asked for an urgent analysis of the issues involved.  They remain conscious that the priority is not to lose the EU funding involved.&quot;</p><p>  It is important to note that there are time constraints with regard to the SEUPB funding, which has to be spent by 2015. SEUPB decided to withdraw the letter of offer for the Narrow Water project and explore  options for the reallocation of the funding to eligible projects capable of being delivered by December 2015.  While this development is unfortunate, this is a project that the Government would like to see delivered in the future and remains committed to.  However, we simply do not have the scale of resources required to advance it at this stage when the priority must be on road maintenance and restoration as against new projects.</p></reply>

I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that there are no current plans to re-open Dunleer station and no proposal in that regard has been made to my Department.  As the Deputy will be aware, CIE is in a difficult financial position and is dependent on continued bank funding.  It has no resources of its own available to fund new projects and there is no funding in the current capital plan for Dunleer station.  The lifetime of the Government's capital investment plan runs to 2016 and within that capital plan, the priority is to protect the operational network and maintain safety standards, rather than the opening of new stations.</p><p>  Consideration of a new government capital investment plan beyond 2016 will begin shortly and consideration can be given to this project within that  overall process.  However, prioritisation  will depend on the overall funding made available to transport for all modes, and within that, the funds made available for heavy rail.  The priority for heavy rail post 2016 will, as at present, be the protection of the operational network and the maintenance of safety standards.  If there are additional funds after that, and this is not certain, there will be competing demands between the opening of new lines, the improvement of existing lines, rolling stock upgrades, the upgrade of in use train stations, as well as the opening of new train stations in different parts of the country.  All of these competing demands will be subject to robust analysis and will require strong business cases justifying their value and demonstrating how they will significantly increase patronage on the rail network.</p></reply>

The general point at issue here arises from a change to driver licensing law in 1989.  Before the change there was a single licence category which covered driving of a car and driving of a car with trailer.  After the change there were two separate categories.  Drivers who had a full licence before the change were entitled to both of the new categories when renewing their licences.  Some people did not tick the box for the car-plus-trailer category, and therefore lost their trailer entitlement.  They were entitled to reclaim that category for up to ten years.  Obviously, that period has long passed.  Last year, following representations from the Irish Farmers Association, among others, I asked the RSA, on a once-off basis, to allow people who inadvertently lost their trailer entitlement in this way to reclaim it.  The significance of 13 November 1989 is that this was the date on which the licence reforms in question came into effect.</p></reply>

No. 477 of 2006), the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test.  In 2008, the RSA having reviewed the car testing specification, proposed a number of modifications to the National Car Test (NCT).  A public consultation on those proposals was conducted by the RSA in 2009 and, having considered the views received, recommended, amongst other developments, that annual testing of cars over ten years old, be introduced.  I accepted that recommendation and decided that with effect from 1 June 2011  all cars older than 10 years other than vintage cars must undergo annual roadworthiness testing.</p><p>  The effects of wear and tear on a vehicle become more evident as it ages and prior to the introduction of annual testing road traffic collision statistics showed that a significant proportion of fatal collisions and serious injuries arose from collisions that involved vehicles that were 10 years old or over.  It is for these reasons I believe that annual testing of such vehicles is a valuable safety measure.  With regard to exempting ten year old vehicles from testing fees every second year of their annual testing schedule, I have no proposals to do so.  The fee charged represents the per test cost of carrying out the testing service.</p></reply>

As I have previously indicated to the House, there were some initial teething problems when the NDLS was launched in late October of last year, and these led to some unacceptable delays in processing driver licence applications, which developed over the first few weeks of the new service.  I met with the acting CEO of the RSA at the time to discuss this, and the RSA introduced a number of measures to address the problem.</p><p>  I understand that the NDLS is now processing applications within eight to thirteen days, in cases where there are no problems in the application, that is to say, in cases where the NDLS does not have to contact the applicant for clarification or additional documentation.  The NDLS assures me that it is on course to have a 5-8 day turnaround for non-problematic applications by the beginning of April.</p></reply>

However, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have no function in relation to the administration of the scheme.  The resolution of the funding difficulties in the scheme is primarily a matter for the trustees, the members of the scheme, the companies participating in the scheme and the regulator of such pension schemes - the Pensions Board.Pension Schemes are closely regulated under Irish and European pension law and the Pensions Board is the statutory regulator.  There are prescribed procedures and limitations in place governing any reductions in pension rights introduced to address funding difficulties in a scheme such as the IASS.  Policy in this regard is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>  The trustees of the IASS announced in February that they had decided in principle on a number of changes to address the funding difficulties of the scheme.  The trustees, who are central to any solution to the funding difficulties, are required by law to act in the best interests of all members, be they active, deferred or pensioner members.  The letter from the trustees to the employers and unions formally requests them to give appropriate consideration to the position of the deferred members in further discussions.  Following consultations between my Department, the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, IBEC and ICTU, an Expert Panel has been established to carry out a detailed investigation of how a final resolution of the industrial relations issues relating to the IASS can be secured.  That investigation will include discussions with the relevant stakeholders, including representatives of deferred members, and the Panel has been asked to make a preliminary report by the end of March.</p></reply>

Therefore, the question of applying for funding from the European Investment Bank (EIB), or any other EU funding programme, does not arise at this time.  It should be noted that no EU funding, loan or grant was secured for phase one of the Western Rail Corridor.</p><p>  Consideration of a new Government capital investment plan beyond 2016 will begin shortly and eligible transport projects prioritised under that plan will be submitted for funding to the EIB.  Whether any heavy rail projects are prioritised will depend on the overall funding made available to transport for all modes, and within that, the funds made available for heavy rail.  The priority for heavy rail post 2016 will be, as at present, the protection of the operational network and the maintenance of safety standards.  If there are additional funds after that, and this is not certain, there will be competing demands between the opening of new lines, the improvement of existing lines, rolling stock upgrades, the upgrade of in-use train stations, as well as the opening of new train stations in different parts of the country.  All of these competing demands will be subject to robust analysis and will require strong business cases justifying their value and demonstrating how they will significantly increase patronage on the rail network.</p></reply>

This is the only light or heavy rail project that is being progressed under the <i>&quot;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-16: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&quot;, </i>the Government's capital investment programme that runs until 2016.  As there are no other new eligible light or heavy rail projects currently progressing, the question of preparing further  applications for funding from EIB does not arise at this time.  However, in conjunction with the  Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform I maintain  contact with the EIB regarding the funding of appropriate projects, including public transport projects, which might be prioritised for development under the next capital plan post 2016.  The EIB has indicated a keen interest in supporting suitable public transport projects which address bottlenecks  and bring added value to the transport network.</p></reply>

The policy on regional airports post-2014 is currently being developed in my Department and will reflect the outcomes of the recently published IWA Knock Study and will also have to comply with the recently adopted revised EU Guidelines on State Aid for airports and airlines. Publication of the revised Guidelines is still awaited. No final decisions have been made in respect of future PSO supports for the Kerry/Dublin or any other routes at this time.</p></reply>

However, there are significant constraints on my Department's overall capital budget. Furthermore, there are other capital demands arising from my primary responsibility to provide a marine emergency response service. My officials have discussed this matter earlier in the year with Mountain Rescue Ireland and as outlined to them, it will be some time later this year before it can be established whether there is any capital funding that could be utilised for mountain rescue services.</p></reply>
