The increase in prescription charges will account for &euro;43 million of this target. The Government is committed to achieving these savings while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>  Medical card holders will be required to pay a &euro;2.50 charge per item for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists, subject to a cap of  &euro;25 per month for each person or family. Prescription charges do not apply to children in the care of the HSE or to methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme. These new rates will be effective from 1 December 2013.</p></reply>

Its overall intention was to review the state of the financial management system in place in the health sector in Ireland at the time in the context of the serious overruns projected to occur in 2012, the continuation of a challenging financial environment for the foreseeable future and the radical reforms envisioned in the Programme for Government.</p><p><b>Recommendations</b></p><p>  The report made a number of recommendations to improve the financial management process within the HSE, with particular reference to managing the transition phase that the health sector was undergoing. The recommendations were grouped into 3 distinct areas:  Improving Financial Performance; Policy Considerations; and Effective Transitioning (Managing the Change).  </p><p><b>New Integrated Financial Management System</b></p><p>  The Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Services &ldquo;Future Health&rdquo; identified, as one of the key challenges, the need for an integrated financial management system. The current financial management system in the HSE was largely inherited from the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the other bodies which were subsumed into the HSE. It has evolved over many years as the structure of the organisation has changed. However it is acknowledged, that given the new requirements for financial management and comprehensive financial reporting, the current operating model is inadequate for its purpose. The Department of Health is committed to working with the HSE to ensure the development and roll out of a comprehensive financial management system as a matter of priority.</p><p>  As part of the process of further strengthening the financial management of the Health Service Executive independent expertise was engaged to evaluate the financial performance management system and a Finance Reform Board has been established within the HSE made up of senior management and representatives from the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p><b>Current Position</b></p><p>  The Finance Reform Board and my Department have endorsed proposals regarding the development and roll out of an integrated financial management system with my the full support and approval. Proposals for significant new projects must be approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which requires a robust business case to be made. The HSE is currently finalising a business case for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

I have received assurances from the HSE that the recruitment process for these new posts is being given priority within the HSE.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>  In relation to expenditure against the 2013 allocation of &euro;35 million and associated 477 posts, the HSE is currently validating the position regarding the new posts filled at the end of October and will then be in a position to estimate the spend once that data is available.  I will provide this information to the Deputy when it becomes available.</p></reply>

In October, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that up to &euro;250m would be available for the project from the sale of the National Lottery, adding to the &euro;450m Exchequer funding already indented.</p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the body responsible for the capital project.  Last August, I announced appointments to this Board to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January this year.  These appointments bring architectural, planning, procurement, engineering and construction expertise to the project.  Also in August, I announced appointments to the Children's Hospital Group Board which, as client for the project, will play a key role in ensuring the new hospital is optimally designed and completed as swiftly as possible.  Earlier this month, Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman took up post as CEO of the Children's Hospital Group, and will play a central role in driving forward the integration of the three hospitals, and the project as a whole.</p><p>  Prior to the commencement of construction, key elements of the project include design development, decant works for the site and planning permission. The new Board has reviewed the design team procurement process, which had been initiated in July, and decided on a change of approach based on its collective expertise and taking into account changing market conditions. While this means that the design team will be selected in Spring 2014, rather than by the end of this year as originally planned, the Board is confident there will be no delay to the project overall.  Work on the review of urgent care centre configuration is at an advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals in this regard to Government shortly.</p><p>  Pre-application planning discussions have commenced, a masterplan for the St. James's Hospital campus is being prepared and St. James's Hospital is working closely with the Development Board and the HSE in relation to the decant phase of the project.</p><p>  Work on developing a detailed timeline is continuing, which will reflect the urgency and priority of the project and also its scale and complexity.  However, at this stage, the Board is confident that construction can begin in Spring 2015.</p></reply>

It includes provision of &euro;2,562 million in respect of the Primary Care Reimbursement Service and &euro;400 million for Primary Care services.  This is an increase of 1.7% and 7.6% respectively on the 2012 figures.</p><p>  Successful transformation of our health services requires a corresponding transformation of the existing funding model.  The first stage in transforming this funding model is to clarify funding streams through the creation of directorates and corresponding programme based budgets.   As part of this process, a Primary Care Directorate was established within the HSE in 2013.  This directorate will oversee the development and strengthening of primary care.</p><p>  In 2013, Primary Care funding of &euro;20 million, nationally, is being invested to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line primary care team posts and to enhance the capacity of the primary care sector.  264.5 additional Primary Care posts, including 72 Public Health Nurses and 40.5 Registered General Nurses, have been approved.  The filling of these posts is at an advanced stage.  From 1st  July 2010, the GP trainee intake increased from 120 to 157 training places per year, in line with GP workforce requirements.</p><p>  Earlier this year, a review was carried under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 in relation to the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates payable to certain health professionals under the relevant Regulations.  Having carefully considered the submissions made during the consultation process, the Minister for Health decided to make an overall reduction of 7.5% in fees and allowances payable to GPs under the GMS and other schemes.  Under the FEMPI legislation, the Minister for Health is required to carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates fixed under the regulations each year.  This will involve a full consultation with stakeholders in 2014.</p><p>  The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health system.  The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary health care.  Considerable progress has been made already in the delivery of primary care centres and 32 centres have opened since May 2011.  </p><p>  Since 2012, primary care infrastructure has been approved and is underway at 15 locations through refurbishment, extension of suitable properties or through new build.  Construction is underway at 6 locations and planning permission has been granted at an additional 22 locations under the 'operational lease' mechanism.</p><p>  The HSE is working with the National Development Finance Agency to progress the PCC Public Private Partnership programme.  Planning applications for the PCC sites have been lodged recently or will be shortly.</p><p>  I am aware that many GPs have invested in their practices.  This, coupled with the increased investment in Primary Care by this Government will provide enhanced, safer services for patients.</p></reply>

These changes took effect from April last. </p><p>  For clarity, the exclusion from travel to work costs relates to removing the weekly amount of &euro;50 allowed to cover standing charges, such as depreciation or other running costs, used when considering travel to work costs as an outgoing where public transport is not available or suitable and a car is required. This means that the HSE will continue to consider the standard mileage costs or public transport costs when assessing eligibility.  </p><p>  Expenses for childcare costs have not been  excluded from the means test assessment.  There are no proposals to reverse the changes introduced.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure. </p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to healthcare for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health and Children has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service and has agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal primary care health service as a first step towards the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.  A range of options are under consideration with a view to bringing developed proposals to Government shortly.</p></reply>

I met the three support groups representing the women concerned in August 2013. At that meeting, I acknowledged that this was a complex issue about which Government had not yet finished its deliberations.  A number of those present described their personal experiences and I acknowledged the adverse effects endured by many  women and their families as a result of symphysiotomy.  In this context I proposed to appoint a judge to meet with the women in order to facilitate decisions on how best to bring closure for them.</p><p>  My officials are actively considering this issue and I intend bringing preliminary proposals to Government in the coming weeks.  I intend to publish the Walsh report when I have received Government approval regarding how best to proceed in relation to this issue.    </p><p>  My priority continues to be to ensure that the women who have had this procedure have their health needs comprehensively and professionally met. In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who may be experiencing any adverse effects as a result of undergoing this procedure. These services include the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.</p></reply>

In calculating the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), the WHO takes account of vital statistics as compiled by national statistical offices (i.e. the Central Statistics Office in the case of Ireland) but also applies a separate weighting to adjust for potential under-reporting.  For most developed countries, including Ireland, the weighting factor is 1.5.  The most recently published WHO statistics are based on this methodology. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland recently implemented a Confidential Maternal Death Enquiry (MDE) system using the same model which has been in operation in the United Kingdom (UK) for many years.  The first report of the MDE for Ireland was published in 2012 and covered the years 2009 to 2011.  Future WHO analysis for Ireland will take account of the MDE results.</p><p>  Comparison with the UK's most recent MDE shows Ireland with a ratio of 8.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 maternities (2009 to 2011) compared with 11.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 maternities (2006 to 2008) for the UK.  It needs to be emphasised that Ireland and the UK are virtually unique in having fully comprehensive MDE reporting systems.  The WHO recognises that international rankings of maternal mortality are, therefore, problematic given the difficulty of obtaining accurate estimates of the levels of under-reporting which exist in most countries.</p><p>  Nevertheless, taking full account of the MDE results, Ireland has amongst the lowest levels of maternal mortality in the developed world and this will continue to be reflected in WHO statistics.  Finally, it also needs to be noted that Ireland is a small country and rare occurrences such as maternal mortality will be subject to significant fluctuations in rates where the data are based on a single year or even where data are aggregated over several years.  As evidence of this, the 95% confidence limits for the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Ireland's MDE covering a three year period (2009 to 2011) range from  4.6 to 12.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 maternities.</p></reply>

The introduction of Hospital Groups will provide for organisational change in the first instance, giving more autonomy and better enabling the reorganisation of services in a well-planned manner.  Over time, this will help to improve services and deliver better outcomes for patients. </p><p>  In July, expressions of interest were invited through the Public Appointments Service for appointment as Chairpersons and members of Hospital Group Boards.  Chairs have now been appointed to all seven Hospital Groups.  CEOs are in place for three of the Groups, and the process of recruiting CEOs for the remaining four Groups will shortly commence, in consultation with Chairpersons, through the Public Appointments Service.  My Department will also enter into discussion with the Chairs with a view to appointing the remaining Board members as soon as possible. </p><p>  A Strategic Advisory Group is now being established which will oversee the establishment of Hospital Groups and the subsequent reorganisation of acute hospital services.  Each group of hospitals will work together as single cohesive entities managed as one, to provide acute care for patients in their area, integrating with community and primary care.  This will maximise the amount of care delivered locally, whilst ensuring complex care is safely provided in larger hospitals.  Hospital Groups will be required, within one year, to develop a strategic plan which will outline their plans for future services within the group area and the role of hospitals within each group will be considered in detail in the context of this strategic plan.</p></reply>

The Special Action Group on Obesity comprises representatives from the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, <i>Safe</i>food and other key stakeholders, to examine and progress a number of issues to address the problem of obesity.  The range of measures being implemented by my Department seeks to promote a healthy lifestyle, to encourage people to make healthier food choices, to become more active and take the first steps towards reducing obesity.  </p><p>  The Special Action Group on Obesity is concentrating on a range of measures including actions such as: calorie on menus in restaurants, how best to support healthy eating choices, the supply of healthy food products in vending machines, the detection and treatment of obesity, healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.  As one of the measures specifically designed to combat Childhood Obesity, on Monday 21<sup>st</sup> October, I launched the <i>Safe</i>food/Healthy Ireland/HSE three year Childhood Obesity Campaign &ndash; <i>Childhood Obesity: Let's take it on &ndash; one small step at a time </i>which is designed to create greater awareness among parent's about the threat of childhood overweight and obesity and provide practical tips to help address the problem with the ultimate aim and effecting behaviour change.  </p><p>  I also tasked SAGO with establishing a sub-committee to investigate and develop a range of options around pricing and other mechanisms in order to reduce consumption of foods and drinks from the top-shelf of the Food Pyramid (as per the Department of Health's Healthy Eating Guidelines) as these foods and drinks are not necessary for health.  The sub-committee's report and recommendations were presented to me on Wednesday, 23<sup>rd</sup> October when I attended a meeting of SAGO and an action plan is now being developed around these recommendations.</p><p>  Because the issue of Childhood Obesity is of such serious concern for me I placed it centre stage of the Irish Presidency of the EU and was successful in having the EU mandated to draw up an EU Action Plan to tackle Childhood Obesity.  This Plan has been drafted and will be finalised before the end of the year.  SAGO will continue to liaise with other Departments and organisations in a cross-sectoral approach to further progress initiatives to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity<b>.</b></p></reply>

The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure.  These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels. </p><p>  A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including </p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, </p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, </p><p>- timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>- reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states.  The price of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.</p><p>  A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the HSE only reimburses generic products which are priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013 with an additional &euro;28 million saved in 2014.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.  It is estimated that this system will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines.  Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State.  The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. </p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August.  The second and third lists containing groups of esomeprazole and rosuvastatin products were published on 20th and 24th September respectively.  Once the IMB has assessed the initial 20 priority products, then a further list of priority products will be identified and assessed by the IMB and the process will continue until all medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.</p><p>  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB  a two stage price reduction process gets underway.  First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September.  Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts.  Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.  The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013.  Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p></reply>

I wrote to the HSE on Thursday 31 October to confirm that the Executive has until 15 November to submit its Service Plan.  In that letter, I also conveyed to the Executive that my overriding priority is patient safety, with the next priority being to treat patients in as timely a fashion as possible.</p><p>  Clearly, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer is a high priority for the HSE.  I welcome the huge improvements that have been made in recent years, led by the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  It is very encouraging to note that five year relative survival for all cancers is rising and is now 56.4% for people diagnosed between 2003-2007, as compared with 49.6% for people diagnosed in 1998-2002.  The Mater Hospital and St. James's Hospital are the two adult designated cancer centres among the hospitals referred to by the Deputy and according to the latest figures available (August 2013), both are in compliance with the HSE Service Plan access targets, which relate to access to breast, prostate and lung cancer clinics. With regard to paediatric cancer care, I am advised that children  are treated according to international protocols and standards of care, that all care is clinically prioritised   and that there are no extraordinary delays for children accessing cancer services.</p><p>  Clearly 2014 will be a very challenging year for the health services.  In meeting this challenge, the goal, wherever possible, is to cut the cost of services rather than the level or quality of the services delivered, and to accelerate the pace of reform. The reform programme for hospitals, as set out in Future Health,aims to deliver more responsive and equitable access to services for all patients; to organise public hospitals into more efficient and accountable hospital groups, which can deliver better patient care for less cost; and to ensure that smaller hospitals continue to play a key role.</p></reply>

Current expenditure on healthcare fell by 10% between 2009 and 2013 and will reduce by a further &euro;361m or 3% in 2014.  Reductions in the health budget are compounded by underlying cost pressures, including substantial population growth and rising incidence of chronic disease.  </p><p>  In addressing the significant financial challenges faced by the health system, the focus is on actions that enhance efficiency, secure sustainability and do not compromise the overall goals of the health system.  My objective is to protect frontline services by cutting the cost of services rather than cutting the services themselves.  Various cost saving measures include reducing the public sector pay bill, the fees paid to professionals and payments to pharmaceutical companies. </p><p>  A total of &euro;666 million of health savings measures have been identified to meet the overall health expenditure ceiling reduction of &euro;361 million for 2014, Programme for Government Commitments of &euro;57 million and health service pressures of &euro;248 million. Clearly the Health Sector will be facing serious challenges in 2014 to keep within its budgetary limits. The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding will be set out in the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s 2014 National Service Plan.  Given the budgetary constraints on the health services in recent years, it remains a priority to focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered, and to reduce costs so as to minimise any negative effect on service provision. </p><p>  The saving measures agreed by Government to be taken by my Department in order to adhere to the 2014 Expenditure Ceiling post adjustments, are set out in the Expenditure report 2014. </p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness or disability.</p><p>  Under this legislation, the determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Section 45 requires the HSE to have regard to a person's, and their spouse or partner's overall financial situation in view of their reasonable expenditure. The HSE gives effect to this legislation and Government policy through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  Where a person's income is in excess of the income thresholds set out in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE uses its discretion to grant a medical card to a person who is unable, due to undue hardship, to arrange a GP service. In doing so, the HSE is obliged to have regard to the financial situation and expenditure of the individual and his or her dependents. </p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill in palliative care, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. </p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness in palliative care, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the HSE responds pro-actively to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals in these circumstances. </p><p>  The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework.  As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure. </p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014, when the specifics of the legislation are known.  </p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to healthcare for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access GP services that are free at the point of use. </p></reply>

I wrote to the HSE  last Thursday 31 October to confirm that the Executive has until 15 November to submit its Service Plan. In that letter, I also conveyed to the Executive that my overriding priority is patient safety, with the next priority being to treat patients in as timely a fashion as possible.  Clearly 2014 will be a very challenging year for the health services. In meeting this challenge, the goal, wherever possible, is to cut the cost of services rather than the level or quality of the services delivered, and to accelerate the pace of reform.

The formation of Hospital Groups, which I announced last May, will allow each Group to manage their own affairs and operate with maximum autonomy. It will also ensure that the treatment required by patients is received at the most appropriate level in the most appropriate and safest setting. I have now appointed Chairs to all seven Hospital Groups, the process of recruitment of CEOs has commenced and the process of establishing a Strategic Advisory Group to oversee the reorganisation of services by Hospital Groups is underway.   The overall aim is to provide efficient and effective care, as close to the patient&rsquo;s home as possible, with a view to improved health outcomes and satisfaction for patients.</p></reply>

With the rapid activation of the Hospital's Major Emergency Plan, patients and staff were safely evacuated, arrangements made with other hospitals and the NAS to ensure that appropriate treatment would remain available to patients and a massive clean-up operation was commenced within hours.  I am particularly grateful to the Western Trust of Northern Ireland, to Altnagelvin, Enniskillen, Sligo and Galway hospitals for their assistance and to the staff of Letterkenny General Hospital who were willingly redeployed to some of these locations to assist with patient care.</p><p>  A key factor in re-establishing services was the replacement of radiology services, through the provision of a mobile CT and modular digital radiology facilities in the carpark, the outsourcing of MRI and the restoration of ultrasound capability.  Modular units were also sourced for the reprovision of ED services and a phased re-opening commenced 3 weeks after the flood.</p><p>  Works on Gynaecology ambulatory care were commenced within weeks and are now complete; this service has been re-commissioned.  A building has been identified in the town centre for the provision of outpatient clinics; it is currently being fitted out.  Work on the hospital Pharmacy has commenced and is due for completion in February 2014. Contractors have been on site from 11 November to work on the Emergency Department and Acute Medical Assessment Unit and these are to be completed in March 2014. A Multipurpose Radiology Interventional Suite, which will have greater functionality than the previous radiology facility at the hospital, has been approved by the national capital steering group and is at design stage.   Project teams have also been established for services in those areas which were significantly impacted by the flooding, such as CCU, Cardiac investigations, medical records, laboratories, mortuary and staff facilities.</p></reply>

There are a number of separate measures currently underway to ensure sustainability of the market, which include cost control initiatives, revised Risk Equalisation Credits to protect community-rated health insurance for all and the ongoing consideration of appropriate regulatory measures necessary to support the market.</p><p>  With regard to health insurance costs, I have consistently emphasised the vital need to address the rising cost of private health insurance and the necessity for all private health insurers to address their cost base aggressively.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance to generate ideas to address health insurance costs.  In June of this year, I  appointed an independent Chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin,  who will work with my Department and the insurers on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market. I want all insurers to address the base cost of their claims and to see all procedures provided in an appropriate, safe, healthcare setting. Work on this review process is progressing well and I expect to receive an initial report from the Chair very shortly.  </p><p>  I am committed to progressively increasing the extent to which risk equalisation compensates for the costs of insuring older customers.  A permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) was introduced with effect from 1 January, 2013. Prior to the introduction of the permanent RES, an Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy had been in operation from 2009 to 2012. Yesterday I received Government approval to the immediate publication of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013, which sets out revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duties that will apply under the Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 March 2014.  Different risk equalisation credits will apply to 'advanced' and 'non-advanced' health insurance policies. There will be no change to the stamp duty payable on lower cost 'non-advanced' health insurance, which will help to ensure that the option of lower cost health insurance remains available. The stamp duty for health insurance products providing 'advanced' cover will increase from &euro;350 to &euro;399 per adult and from &euro;120 to &euro;135 per child. This will help direct support, in the form of higher risk equalisation credits, where it is needed most and will subsidise health insurance for the most vulnerable patients. Under the Health Insurance Acts, I set the rates for risk equalisation credits and the Minister for Finance sets the rate of stamp duty require to fund those credits.      </p><p>  The decreasing membership of the health insurance market, in addition to the adoption of industry-wide strategies, represents a significant challenge to the long term continuation of community rating and sustainability of the market. In particular, the proliferation of plans available on the market and the increasing segmentation of the market due to strategies adopted by the commercial providers is of growing concern to me. I am open to considering any practical measures or initiatives which help to maintain affordability, and provide greater clarity, for consumers seeking to purchase health insurance. I intend to address this further in the New Year in order to simplify things for the consumer and will consider the regulatory measures necessary to ensure a smooth transition from the current system of a voluntary private health insurance market to a Universal Health Insurance system.</p></reply>

It is hard to see in any context how the purchase of a bank which has been focussed on downsizing over the past number of years would match the goals and ambition of strategic investment.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) which will absorb the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF).</p><p>  Using the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, we will maximise our resources to enhance growth in the Irish economy and improve key infrastructure to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and to create employment.  Officials of my Department are currently preparing the necessary legislation which I anticipate will be enacted early next year.  Already, in the lifetime of this Government, the NPRF has established funds that support both strategic projects and a number that support SME financing.  Further assessment of the need to create a Strategic Investment Bank over and above the contribution expected from the ISIF will be informed by the requirements of the economy once the Government&rsquo;s key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed.</p></reply>

I will be bringing forward an amendment at Committee Stage to provide that where a student is being charged a full adult premium that the adult ceiling for relief will apply.  This amendment was sought by the health insurance industry.  In addition, the current scheme of relief requires a defined relationship between the policyholder and the individual insured in order for the tax relief to apply for premiums paid on behalf of others.  I have decided to remove this requirement through a Committee Stage amendment also.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that sufficient personal details for individuals covered by health insurance policies which would enable students in full-time education to be identified are not necessary for administering the granting of tax relief at source for medical insurance premiums, and are, therefore, not required to be included in the annual returns received from health insurers.  Consequently there is no basis on which an estimate of the impact of applying the adult ceiling to students who are being charged a full adult premium could be compiled.  Such information could not be obtained without requiring the health insurers to provide additional personal details in their annual returns, followed by carrying out a significant development of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; computer systems.</p><p>  Furthermore, it is not possible to anticipate the impact on claims for tax relief that might arise due to the removal of the existing defined relationship between the policyholder and the individual insured in order for the tax relief to apply.

These data reflect Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) employment by NACE Rev. 2, two digit classification.  However, I am informed by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) that caution should be taken with interpreting this disaggregated data due to their small sample size and therefore high margin of error.  According to the data, the combined employment contribution of the NACE codes 20 and 21 in the second quarter of 2013 amounted to about 37,500 employees, or around 2.0 per cent of total economy-wide employment.  My Department is not aware of any official data on the indirect employment resulting from the sector.  CSO input-output analysis tables suggest that the multiplier effect from pharma-chem activity is low compared to other sectors.  This is likely due to the high share of imports and intellectual property in pharma-chem output.<table><tr><th>Average Employment (&lsquo;000s)</th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2013 H1</div></th></tr><tr><td>NACE codes 20 and 21</td><td><div>32.6</div></td><td><div>31.1</div></td><td><div>35.0</div></td><td><div>33.3</div></td><td><div>32.9</div></td><td><div>37.2</div></td></tr></table></p><p>  When looking at specific sectors, the most useful way of estimating the contribution to growth is to look at the value added of that sector using the output (rather than expenditure) approach to estimating economic activity.  Gross value added (GVA) is conceptually similar to GDP, but examines production on a sectoral level, rather than through final expenditure.  The CSO&rsquo;s National Income and Expenditure tables provide data on GVA in the pharma-chem sector (NACE codes 20 and 21) in both constant and current prices, although the data also include NACE code 19 (believed to be small relative to the other two).  The table below therefore provides estimates of the GVA of NACE codes 20 and 21, their percentage of total output and their contribution to GVA growth between 2008 and 2012.<table><tr><th>GVA (constant basic prices)</th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td>GVA &ndash; NACE codes 19, 20 and 21 <br /><br />(&euro; million)</td><td><div>10,239</div></td><td><div>12,633</div></td><td><div>15,981</div></td><td><div>17,412</div></td><td><div>17,868</div></td></tr><tr><td>GVA &ndash; NACE codes 19, 20 and 21 <br /><br />(% of total GVA)</td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total GVA growth <br /><br />(% y-o-y)</td><td><div>-0.4</div></td><td><div>-4.1</div></td><td><div>-0.9</div></td><td><div>2.8</div></td><td><div>0.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>-NACE 19, 20 and 21 contribution (percentage points)</td><td><div>-0.8</div></td><td><div>1.7</div></td><td><div>2.6</div></td><td><div>0.9</div></td><td><div>0.3</div></td></tr></table></p><p>  Trade figures are reported on a monthly basis as part of the CSO&rsquo;s &ldquo;Goods Exports and Imports&rdquo; release, and are broken down (in value terms) according to standard international trade classification (SITC) categories.  Exports of the sector can be loosely classified as SITC categories 51 (organic chemicals) and 54 (medical and pharmaceutical products), and these are outlined below.<table><tr><th><div>Exports (&euro;, million)</div></th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2013<br /><br />(Jan-Aug)</div></th></tr><tr><td>SITC category codes 51 and 54</td><td><div>34,566</div></td><td><div>39,852</div></td><td><div>43,682</div></td><td><div>46,362</div></td><td><div>44,604</div></td><td><div>27,128</div></td></tr></table></p><p>It should however be noted that, due to the high import intensity of output in the pharma-chem sector, the net impact on GDP of any decline in exports is unlikely to be as large as the gross decline.  Research conducted by officials from my Department (available at <i><font color="#0000FF">tinyurl.com/pharmapaper</font></i> ) suggests an input share of gross output of about 50 per cent in the sector.  A decrease in exports in the sector is therefore likely to coincide with declining imports (on both the services side through licenses and royalties as well as raw chemical imputs), reducing the impact on net trade.</p></reply>

Since Q3 2011, net employment has increased by some 27,800.  A number of measures were introduced under the Initiative including the introduction of the reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism-related services. Measures to reduce the cost to employers of taking on new employees included a halving in the lower rate of Class A employer PRSI from 8.5% to 4&frac14;% on jobs paying up to &euro;356 per week (&euro;18,523 annually) to apply between July 2011 and the end December 2013. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated numbers of income earners whose main source of income is taxable under the PAYE system and whose annual gross income is less than &euro;18,512, are set out as follows for tax years 2007 to 2013 inclusive.<table><tr><th>Tax Year</th><th><div>2007</div></th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012e</div></th><th><div>2013e</div></th></tr><tr><td>Numbers (000s)</td><td><div>773</div></td><td><div>716</div></td><td><div>658</div></td><td><div>644</div></td><td><div>612</div></td><td><div>644</div></td><td><div>642</div></td></tr></table></p><p><i>Source: </i>Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  Estimated numbers are rounded to the nearest one thousand.</p><p>  It should be noted that Gross Income referred to above is as defined in Revenue Statistical Reports. It should also be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit in these figures.</p><p>  The numbers for tax years 2012 and 2013 are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2011 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. These figures are, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised  .</p><p>  The estimated numbers provided above include both full-time and part-time earners.  Revenue income statistics are compiled on an annual basis and include incomes that were earned over a period of less than a year. It is not possible to distinguish the numbers in employment between those in full-time employment and those in part-time employment.</p><p>  In relation to the reduced VAT rate, between Q3 2011 and Q2 2013 the numbers employed in the accommodation and food services sector have increased by 11,800 (10%) with a sizeable portion of this related to the reduced VAT rate. Work published by my Department found that in year-on-year terms, compared with a range of counterfactuals there was a net employment growth differential of 8-9% in this sector between Q2 2011 and Q2 2012 since the introduction of the reduced rate (MTFS, November 2012). A July 2013 Deloitte Report prepared for Bord F&aacute;ilte found the total increase in jobs following the VAT reduction could be estimated at c.10,000.  The Initiative also provided additional public capital investment of some &euro;109 million targeted specifically towards schools, local and regional roads and national energy retrofitting. Estimates suggest that between 8 and 12 jobs are created directly for every &euro; 1 million in additional capital expenditure, indicating these measures alone directly supported the creation of over 1,000 jobs. Jobs Initiative measures also served to support on-going improvements in labour cost competitiveness, a feature supportive of the labour market recovery we are now evidencing.</p></reply>

For example, Revenue has answered in excess of 580,000 telephone calls and replied to in excess of 200,000 letters or emails since March 2013.  Revenue has further advised me that because LPT is a new tax it is difficult to anticipate service volumes and as a consequence the number of agents required.  Revenue has acknowledged that exceptional delays in accessing the Helpline, which is the primary contact point for LPT queries, were experienced by some callers in the days immediately following the issue of the 2014 notifications. Access was also hampered on an intermittent basis on those days by technical issues in the service provider&rsquo;s telephony system which, have since been resolved. </p><p>  In response to the demand for service, Revenue ensured that extra resources were deployed to the helpline within two days of the peak period occurring and also deployed extra resources to its own internal support service to cater for the more complex queries.  It has put contingency plans in place to further rapidly increase the number of agents on the helpline should it be necessary to do so.  In total there are now 200 agents fully deployed to LPT telephone call handling.  In addition to the extra staff deployment, callers can now leave their telephone contact details on the system in preference to waiting for service and will receive an out of hours call back from the LPT team.  Revenue has extended the helpline opening hours from 9am to 5pm to 8am to 8pm since 6 November and will maintain these hours for the peak filing periods.</p><p>  Revenue has also extended the paper filing date by one week to 14th November to allow people further consider their 2014 payment method before committing their preferred option to Revenue.  The combined initiatives of additional deployments, extended opening hours and the extended &lsquo;paper&rsquo; deadline have already significantly reduced the waiting times on the Helpline. </p><p>  I again commend Revenue for the excellent work it has done in taking LPT from concept to a fully functioning tax in such a short period of time, including the drafting of legislation, the building of a brand new property register, the provision of customer service to such a large volume of taxpayers and crucially the contribution of &euro;215m to date to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

However, the following may be helpful to the Deputy.</p><p>  I am informed that local authorities are liable to pay LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties are used to accommodate people with special housing needs &ndash; the legislation provides for a specific exemption in these cases.  I am further informed that, based on estimates provided by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, the Revenue Commissioners expect that residential properties owned by local authorities and other social housing providers will amount to approximately 160,000 properties.  They will, however, be unable to confirm final figures until details of all the properties are provided by local authorities and social housing bodies and the data are fully analysed.</p><p>  I am further advised that, for local authority owned properties that are not exempt from LPT, the market value of each of these properties will be deemed to fall into the first valuation band, that is &euro;100,000 or less, which represents an LPT charge of &euro;45 per property for 2013 and &euro;90 per property for 2014. </p><p>  In accordance with the legislative amendment which I introduced to the House earlier this year, LPT due from local authorities and other social housing providers in respect of 2013 is payable on or before 1 January 2014, as is the LPT due for 2014, and they can avail of the full range of payment options provided by the Revenue Commissioners.

It will not be used to fund the Resolution Fund pursuant to Section 15 of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011.  Section 10 of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 established a resolution fund in Ireland. The purpose of this fund is to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution. Authorised credit institutions are required to make contributions to the fund in the form of a resolution fund levy. The domestic banks in Ireland are currently subject to the Credit Institutions Stabilisation Act (&ldquo;CISA&rdquo;) 2010 and are therefore outside the scope of the levy until December 2014.  Upon expiry of the CISA the domestic banks will be required to pay into the resolution fund.</p><p>  In July of this year the Commission published its proposal for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) as the next essential step to the banking union. The SRM proposal includes provision for a single resolution fund for Member States participating in the banking union. It is anticipated that when the SRM comes into force the domestic banks in Ireland will contribute to this fund in place of our national resolution fund. Therefore, the domestic banks will be making a contribution as a result of the SRM. This contribution will be held in the single resolution fund to be set up at EU level under the SRM.</p><p>  The purpose of the single resolution fund is to provide a source of funding for the resolution of banks in the EU banking union. One of the objectives of the SRM is to avoid that funds needed for such purposes come from national budgets. This in turn assists in minimising taxpayers&rsquo; exposure to the costs of bank rescues. </p><p>  The fund is to be built up over a ten year period from the date of entry into force of the SRM. While negotiations are on-going, I expect the SRM to enter into force sometime in 2015.	</p></reply>

This was reflected in the report on Economic and Monetary Union prepared by the Presidents of the European Council, the Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank.  The SSM which is the first part of this process was formally adopted by ECOFIN in October and has entered into force. The next important step is the establishment of the SRM. Such a mechanism is considered necessary on the basis of the principle underpinning the banking union that where supervision is centralised it should be complemented with a centralised resolution authority. </p><p>  The SRM proposal consists of the Single Resolution Board and a Single Resolution Fund, financed by contributions from the financial sector. As the Deputy notes the ultimate decision maker in this process is the Commission, as only an EU institution can carry out such a function and not an agency. While the SRM proposal is under consideration at the Council, the view of the Commission and most Member States is that we should proceed on the basis of the current proposal. </p><p>  On the second issue raised by the Deputy regarding resolution of a bank, Article 16 of the draft proposal sets out the procedures to be followed. </p><p>  The first step involves the ECB or a national resolution authority making an assessment whether:</p><p>(i) an entity is failing or likely to fail;</p><p>(ii) having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, there is no other reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector or supervisory action would prevent its failure within a reasonable timeframe;</p><p>(iii) a resolution action is necessary in the public interest. </p><p>  If the Single Resolution Board is of the view that all of these conditions have been met, it is required to make a recommendation to the Commission that the bank be placed into resolution. If the Commission agrees with the Board, then it will decide accordingly. If it is however of the view that the conditions are not met, there is a due process that must be followed, but ultimately it can decide not to place the entity in resolution and in such circumstances national insolvency law will apply. </p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s final point, there are a number of measures in the proposal which require the ECB to work in conjunction with the Single Resolution Board to ensure consistency so that the system works effectively. Both share the objective of ensuring financial stability and growth in the Euro area. This is considered a crucial step to overcome the current financial fragmentation and uncertainty, to ease funding conditions for sovereigns and banks and to break the link between the two. This is in the best interests of Member States and the banking system as a whole.</p><p>  Furthermore, Article 12 of the SRM proposal sets out the resolution objectives, which include the need to avoid significant adverse effects on financial stability <i>&ldquo;in the EU and Member States concerned&rdquo;</i>.  This means that account has to be taken of national interests in any resolution decision. </p><p>  While this represents the current position of the proposal, the matter will be discussed by Ministers at the forthcoming Ecofin this week.</p></reply>

The due dates for paying LPT are set out in legislation.   The due date for paying the 2013 LPT was on or before 1 July 2013.  The due date for payment of the liability for 2014 and future years is on or before 1 January.</p><p>  The full year charge for LPT is 0.18% of the mid-point of the valuation band for each property, where the property is value is under &euro;1 million.  (For properties valued over &euro;1 million, the rate is 0.18% on the first &euro;1 million and 0.25% on the excess, with no banding applied.)  In the case raised by the Deputy the full year charge for both properties is a total of &euro;810, the charge on the first property being &euro;585 and on the second being &euro;225.  The half-year charges were each rounded down to &euro;292 and &euro;112 respectively.  The letter advised the person concerned that a detailed breakdown of the liability per property was available online through <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>   using the Property ID and PIN provided on the letter. </p><p>  LPT is chargeable on residential properties in the State. In most cases the owner of the property is liable. In the context of a rented property, the landlord is liable where the property is let for a period of less than twenty years.  </p><p>  The LPT legislation provides a return date of 7 November for liable persons to advise Revenue of their payment option.  The Deputy may be aware that Revenue has extended the paper filing deadline by one week to 14 November.  The online filing date has been extended by Revenue to 27 November. These deadlines are to ensure there is sufficient time to set up direct debits or other phased payment arrangements in time to start in 1 January.</p><p>  The person in question was issued with a letter that set out his liability for 2014 and requested him to confirm to Revenue his chosen payment method for 2014. This does not mean that he is required to pay his 2014 LPT liability before 1 January 2014 unless he chooses to do so. The only requirement is for him to confirm his payment method online by 27 November. As the person in question is a multiple property owner he is obliged to pay and file online, therefore his payment options are: - Spread payments evenly throughout 2014 by way of direct debit (direct debits commence on 15 January 2014);</p><p>- Spread payments evenly throughout 2014 by way of deduction from salary, pension or Government payment;</p><p>- Pay in full now by debit/credit card. </p><p>- Pay in full by single debit authority (like a cheque), which will mean the bank account will be debited by Revenue on 21 March 2014.</p><p>  Should the person wish to continue paying his LPT liability using<b><i></i></b>Single Debit Authority, he should access his online account via <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i> using his Property ID and PIN numbers and complete the mandate as instructed.  I can confirm that if he uses the Single Debit Authority<b><i></i></b>option his account will not be deducted until 21 March 2014, unless he specifies an earlier payment date. </p><p>  Questions about how revenues from the LPT are used should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing OPFTC and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The new credit will be targeted such that it is available only to the primary carer of the child.  A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child.  This is the same condition that applies to the current OPFTC.  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child, as can happen with the OPFTC, is unsustainable.  </p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only.  The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.  </p><p>  Allocation of child care responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree.  However, having listened carefully to the views expressed by colleagues and Deputies, I have asked my officials to explore how the credit could be used by another individual, where the primary carer chooses not to, or cannot, claim it and accordingly I will be bringing forward an amendment at Committee Stage.  However, I have no plans to retain a shared but reduced One-Parent Family Tax Credit.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-13a.143.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013111300073#WRG00800"><p>As the Deputy has noted, the main tax incentive for innovation in Ireland is the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit which gives a company a tax credit of 25% for expenditure on qualifying R&amp;amp;D.  As was highlighted in the Report of the Review of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit 2013, which is available on the tax policy website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>, this is a very competitive regime by international standards and has been very successful at incentivising investment in R&amp;amp;D in Ireland and supporting employment in Ireland.  The proposal from the Deputy seems similar to the Patent Income Relief scheme which was previously available in Ireland, and which was abolished in 2010.  The decision to abolish this relief was made following consideration of a recommendation to this effect in the Report of the Commission on Taxation (2009).  The Commission on Taxation was of the view that the exemption for patent income was not an effective measure in incentivising enterprises to engage in research and development activities in Ireland and that it had been used instead as a tax-efficient means of remunerating employees and directors.</p><p>  The R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit regime provides a more direct and effective incentive for enterprises to innovate and invest in R&amp;amp;D activities.  The scheme has been enhanced considerably in recent years to make it one of the most competitive of its kind anywhere in the world, and has been most successful in this regard, as was confirmed by the 2013 Review. </p><p>  Further, the &ldquo;key employee&rdquo; element of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit was introduced in 2012 to allow the benefit of this tax credit to be transferred to an individual employee in certain circumstances, and may reward employees for innovation in the way suggested by the Deputy.  This element of the regime is only in its early stages but is gathering momentum and is viewed very positively by innovative firms: according to our independent survey of R&amp;amp;D active firms, which was conducted as part of the 2013 Review, over 70% of firms surveyed are positively disposed to the key employee provision.</p><p>  Finally, I would like to address the broader issue and to assure the Deputy that my Department is always looking at ways that the tax code may be used to incentivise innovation in Ireland.  As was noted in the recent 2013 R&amp;amp;D Report, the responsibility for developing a policy environment that fosters innovation cuts across a number of Departments, including the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well as my own Department.  As tax is only one method of incentivising innovation, this report has recommended that the relevant Departments work closely together to make sure that the policy outcomes of each different government support are aligned.</p></reply>

No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.</p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.</p><p>  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.</p><p>  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS</p><p>Hours</p><p>Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.</p><p>This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;</p></reply>

The funding arrangements made by my Department for post primary schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system.  At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.</p><p>  My Department provides funding to Community and Comprehensive schools on a budget basis that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school etc.  With regard to the Education and Training Board (ETB) sector, formerly known as the VEC sector, financial allocations are made to ETBs as part of a block grant. ETBs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and each is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need.</p><p>  My Department provides funding to voluntary secondary schools by way of per capita grants.  The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 48/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding to voluntary secondary schools.  The circular states that capitation funding provided for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.  I have no plans to amend the present funding arrangements at second level.</p></reply>

The identification process for DEIS was in line with international best practice and had regard to, and employed, the existing and most appropriate data sources available.  It was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's Regional Offices and the Inspectorate.  The choice of variables included in the assessment of disadvantage was guided by the definition of disadvantage in the Education Act, (1998) which refers both to learning outcomes and to social and economic factors.</p><p>  In the primary sector the identification of primary schools, for participation in DEIS, was based on analysis of a survey, carried out by the ERC, of all primary schools. In the case of second-level schools, analysis of centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils Database and the State Examinations Commission databases determined the identification of post-primary schools for participation in DEIS.  There are no measures, within the programme, to remove schools from DEIS.</p><p>  A key priority for my Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  To this end resources in DEIS schools have been protected, with no overall changes to DEIS-related staffing levels or DEIS funding in 2013.  That challenge is significant, given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure.  This limits the capacity for any additionally to the DEIS programme.</p></reply>

Research carried out by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) for the Educational Disadvantage Committee found strong evidence for the proposition that the disadvantage associated with poverty and social exclusion assumes a multiplier effect when large numbers of pupils in a school are from a similar disadvantaged background (the "social context effect").</p><p>  It is this principle that underpins  the approach taken under DEIS &quot;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&quot; the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion which focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from the most disadvantaged communities.  Schools were identified for inclusion in DEIS by virtue of their identified level of disadvantage which was based on the concentration of disadvantaged pupils enrolled in individual schools.  In the current economic climate the focus of my Department is to retain where possible key resources in those schools targeted under the DEIS programme supporting children most at risk of educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

The making of valuations for rating is the Commissioner&rsquo;s sole prerogative and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p><p>  The procedures for making an application for a determination of valuation are prescribed in section 27 of the Valuation Act, 2001, wherein it is provided that any one of the following - an occupier of a property, a rating authority, a person as respects a property to which he/she is an interest holder or an occupier of a property that appears on a valuation list - may apply in writing to the Commissioner of Valuation for a revision of an existing valuation or for a new valuation to be determined in respect of a new building. The statutory fee prescribed for the service is &euro;250 which should accompany the application to the Valuation Office.</p><p>  Under section 28 (4) of the Act, a Revision Officer appointed by the Commissioner may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances (MCC) has occurred since the property was last revised. MCC is defined in section 3 of the Act as a change of circumstances, which consist of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.</p><p>  Should the foregoing MCC criteria be satisfied, the appointed Revision Officer will consider the application and determine and issue a valuation for the subject property within a period of six months from the date of his appointment.  The notice of the decision by way of a Proposed Valuation Certificate will issue to the applicant, who, if dissatisfied with the decision, will have the right to make representations in respect of the proposed valuation and will have 28 days to do so, from the date of issue of the certificate. The Revision Officer is required to consider the representations prior to finalising the valuation and issuing a Final Valuation Certificate and amending the Valuation List.</p><p>  If dissatisfied with the outcome of the representations, the occupier will have a further statutory right to make an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and thereafter to the Valuation Tribunal.  The Valuation Tribunal is an independent body set up to settle disputed valuations between the Commissioner of Valuation and individual ratepayers.  In relation to the appeal process, I might mention that legislative proposals are currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas which would result in the first appeal to the Commissioner being removed, in which case, the appeal would be to the Valuation Tribunal only. This is one of a number of legislative proposals set out in the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill which is currently awaiting a Committee stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. However, it will be a matter for the Oireachtas to determine how such proposals proceed or otherwise.</p><p>  Regarding the levying of rates, the position is that under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the determination of valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation of that property determined by the Valuation Office and the annual rate on valuation (ARV) set annually by the elected members of the rating authority. Rates can only be collected by the rating authority on property which has been valued under the Valuation Act, 2001 and there is no mechanism to otherwise collect rates pending the determination and issue of the valuation under the Act.</p></reply>

These include recapitalising the pillar banks to enable them to commence lending again, re-establishing control of public expenditure, rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad, introducing the 2011 Jobs Initiative and delivering commitments under the 2012 and 2013 Action Plans for Jobs.  All of these measures are combining in different ways to support companies, attract investment and support jobs growth.  It is not feasible to disaggregate the impact of one initiative over another in what is a complementary suite of activity on the part of the Government to rebuild the economy.</p><p>  However, the latest employment figures published by the CSO show that the number of people in employment increased by 33,800 in Quarter 2 of this year compared to the same period in 2012.  This was the third consecutive Quarter where employment increased year-on-year.  We have now moved from a situation where the private sector was losing over 7,000 jobs per month before this Government came into office, to one where it is creating close to 3,000 jobs per month.  This follows on the success of Enterprise Ireland and IDA client companies in creating almost 10,000 net new jobs last year &ndash; their best performance in many years.</p><p>  In Quarter 2 of this year, employment grew in nine of the fourteen economic sectors reported on by the CSO.  These included Agriculture, Forestry &amp;amp; Fishing, Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Services, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail, and Industry.  All of these sectors have been targeted for support under the Action Plan for Jobs process.</p><p>  The Government will continue to build on this progress through the Action Plan for Jobs in 2014, as we continue to transform the economy from one based on unsustainable debt to one based on enterprise, innovation and exports.</p></reply>

Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  Typically over 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years.  Previously self-employed persons in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available to other job-seeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients.  </p><p>  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment. </p><p>  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.</p><p>  Further, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments, including the previously self-employed, may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p></reply>

The governing contribution year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which a claim is made.  So, for claims made in 2013, the relevant tax/PRSI year is 2011.  The person concerned made a claim for illness benefit on 21<sup>st</sup> October 2013.  The governing contribution year in respect of their claim is thus 2011.  The governing contribution year is determined by legislation therefore it is not possible to use an alternative reference year.</p><p>  A person who qualifies for illness benefit at a reduced rate may claim a top-up payment of supplementary welfare allowance if their means are insufficient to meet their needs.

The current range of payment options includes payment to an account in a bank, building society or certain credit unions that have been authorised by the banking and credit union regulators, payment at a local post office or payment by cheque. </p><p>  The Department has undertaken a root and branch examination of its payment processes, methods and approaches. This resulted in the preparation of a Payment Strategy which was approved by Government and will be published before the end of the year.  The aim of the Payment Strategy is to modernise the Department&rsquo;s payment delivery approach by delivering payments to customers electronically and in a way that facilitates direct debits, ATM withdrawal, point of sale deductions and online payments by customers. The Strategy has the goal of reducing significantly the level at which welfare payments are made in cash. At present, 50% of all social welfare payments are disbursed in cash. This amounted to approximately &euro;9.5 billion distributed over 43.7 million transactions last year. The analysis undertaken for the Payment Strategy indicates the very significant variation in the cost of different payment methods. The cost of issuing a welfare payment in cash is six and a half times more than paying to an account in a financial institution and three times more than issuing a payment by cheque rather than EFT.</p><p>  The Payment Strategy sets out a multi-phased approach to be implemented over five years. The first phase has commenced with contract negotiations underway with An Post to maintain existing over the counter cash services. This will ensure that customers can continue to receive their payments in cash at local post offices for the foreseeable future. It provides an assurance in the continuity of cash payments to customers for up to six years while other aspects of the Strategy are progressing. </p><p>  The next phase of the Strategy will be the progressive migration of customers to Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payments.  The move to electronic payments for social welfare transactions is a trend that has been apparent for some time, and we have seen that most new social welfare customers (aside from jobseekers) are choosing EFT as their preferred method of payment.  Last year four out of every five new customers claiming child benefit elected to be paid into an account. The Department does not intend migrating higher risk customers to an electronic payment until appropriate and robust measures are defined and fully implemented to mitigate any potential for increased risk of fraud within an electronic payments environment. </p><p>  Moving to electronic payments will require a significant effort to assist and support suitable customers over the five year period.  The Department will work energetically to help customers and their representatives in the transition period.  The Deputy can, however, be assured that customers will not be refused a payment simply because they cannot receive it electronically.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Commercial decisions by individual private operators in relation to its infrastructure are a matter for the company concerned.  Any regulatory issues surrounding the provision of services are the responsibility of ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Kerry, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at .  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Kerry.  This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the roll-out of services by service providers.  ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the roll-out of advanced mobile broadband services.</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.

The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence Charges, and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.</p><p>  Approximately 357,000 properties have been registered for the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge, which has raised in excess of &euro;390m over its five years of operation.  It is not possible to state with any certainty the level of non-compliance with the Charge, and therefore an estimate of the amount outstanding would not be sound.  However, I am confident that compliance levels are high, given the amount raised by the Charge to date.  This year will be the final year of the operation of the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge.  Since its introduction in 2009, the Charge has been an important source of revenue for local authorities and has funded the provision of vital local services.</p></reply>

Through support for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland&rsquo;s radon advice and awareness work, my Department is supporting efforts to raise public awareness of the risks posed by radon. Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary.</p><p>  Since 1998, the Building Regulations require all new buildings to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction. In October 2004, an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations ( Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture ) was published, incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This guidance document is aimed at ensuring that radon protection measures are carried out more effectively. Copies of the guidance documents are available on my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; </p><p>  If a dwelling is found to have a high radon level, remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department, Radon in Buildings - Corrective Options , which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The RPII has also issued guidance, Understanding Radon Remediation - A Householders Guide, available on the Institute&rsquo;s website at , together with a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and offer specific advice and recommendations. In addition, the RPII can be contacted for radon advice on free-phone 1800 300 600.   </p><p>  A working group from a number of Government Departments and Agencies, including the RPII and the Health Service Executive, is currently finalising a report on the development of a national radon strategy which will shortly be presented to me. I understand the report will make a series of recommendations regarding increasing awareness of radon. There are no plans at present to establish a scheme of grant assistance for radon remediation.</p></reply>

This legislation requires that appropriate security measures be taken to guard against unauthorised access to, as well as any unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of, personal data, and allows the Data Protection Commissioner to carry out investigations of security breaches on receipt of a complaint or on his own initiative.  In 2011, the Data Protection Commissioner introduced a Code of Practice on Personal Data Security Breaches under section 13(2)(b) of the Data Protection Acts.  The Code provides guidance on good practice in dealing with data security breaches, including the reporting of such breaches to the Commissioner's Office.</p><p>  I am informed by the Data Protection Commissioner that his Office was notified of the data security breach referred to by the Deputy in accordance with the Personal Data Security Breach Code of Practice.  Given the seriousness of the breach the Data Protection Commissioner sent in an inspection team to investigate the breach.  I understand that the Commissioner has received a preliminary report on the findings of the inspection team.  I also understand that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigations has received a report on the matter and are investigating the issue further.</p><p>  The European Commission published a Proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation in January 2012.  The Proposal includes specific provisions in relation to the notification of personal data breaches to relevant supervisory authorities and individuals who may be affected by them.

The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 provides for penalties of up to life imprisonment and, at the discretion of the court, a fine for persons who traffick or attempt to traffick other persons including for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  It also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose.  Penalties of up to life imprisonment and, at the discretion of the court, a fine apply in respect of these offences.  Furthermore it is an offence for a person to solicit for prostitution a person who s/he knows or has reasonable grounds for believing is a trafficked person.  The penalty can be up to five years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine on conviction on indictment.</p><p>  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in my Department in 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  In addition to this dedicated Unit there are 3 other dedicated Units in State Agencies dealing with the issue namely:</p><p> - the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p> - the Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive;  and</p><p> - a specialised Human Trafficking legal team in the Legal Aid Board.</p><p>  Dedicated personnel are also assigned to deal with the prosecution of cases in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff in the New Communities and Asylum Seekers Unit in the Department of Social Protection facilitates victims moving into mainstream social services.  There are also a wide range of training and awareness raising activities ongoing and extensive consultation structures exist with up to 70 State Agencies, Non- Governmental Organisations and International Organisations.</p><p>  The State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking including those persons who have been trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  These services include accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, vocational training and education.  The Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive develops individual comprehensive Care Plans for all persons who are potentially victims of human trafficking (including those who have been trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation) addressing all of the support services that are required.  My Department also provides funding to Ruhama who work with predominately with female victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  A detailed Guide to the Procedures for supporting and protecting victims of human trafficking, along with other Guides and leaflets, are accessible on the dedicated anti-trafficking website <b>www.blueblindfold.gov.ie</b>.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to the issue of Human Trafficking (including the trafficking of women for the purpose of sexual exploitation) is set out in the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Persons 2009-2012 which set out 144 Actions to address this issue.  A copy of the National Action Plan and a Review of the Plan are available on the dedicated Anti-Trafficking site www.blueblindfold.gov.ie.  A new National Action Plan to cover the period from 2013 to 2016 is currently being prepared.  A process of consultation with other state agencies and civil society which will significantly inform the direction and content of the new National Action Plan.  The prevention and detection of human trafficking and the protection of its victims has also been a policing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the past number of years and it remains a priority in 2013.</p></reply>

The advice for 2014 is that landings should be no more than 889,886 tonnes. </p><p>  As the Deputies will be aware, mackerel is Ireland&rsquo;s most important fishery, and the long running situation whereby both Iceland and the Faeroes have been engaged in unacceptable and irresponsible fishing of this stock has been, and is, a matter of deep concern to me. My approach as Minister has always been to engage in the negotiations between the EU and the other Coastal States (Iceland, Faeroes &amp;amp; Norway) with a view to protecting Ireland&rsquo;s interests while at the same time being prepared to go some way towards meeting the expectations of Iceland and the Faeroes.</p><p>  In this regard, I have placed this issue on the agenda of the Council of Fisheries Ministers on numerous occasions, most recently at the meeting held on the 17th of October.  In advance of that meeting, I also held bilateral meetings with Commissioner Damanaki, Spanish Fisheries Minister Canete, UK Minister Eustice and Scottish Minister Lochead to press Ireland&rsquo;s case.  At the Council meeting, I sought information from the Commission (who negotiate on behalf of the EU at the Coastal States meetings) on the current state of play in the negotiations and, in particular, details on the Commissions&rsquo; discussion with Norway, a key partner for the EU on this issue.</p><p>  I have consistently argued that any new offer to Iceland must be jointly agreed with Norway on the basis of equal burden sharing, that Iceland should not be granted access to EU waters as a part of any deal and that any deal must also protect the interests of EU Member States like Ireland who have relied on this fishery for over 40 years. I have always made it clear, however, that I was not opposed to a deal and recognized that Iceland (and Faeroes) should be provided with fair and justifiable quota shares.  </p><p>  In this regard, I asked that the Commissioner and my fellow Ministers give serious consideration to a proposal developed by the European Pelagic Industry that would involve a tiered approach with different percentage shares for each of the Coastal States depending upon the level of the Total Allowable Catch advice from year to year.  The core concept behind this proposal is to protect those fleets that have developed and now depend upon the mackerel fishery over a long number of years. </p><p>  I was pleased that the Commissioner and many of the Member States took away this concept for more detailed examination in advance of the Coastal State negotiations in London on the 22nd  of October, and with the positive consideration of all of the points raised by me.</p><p>  At the negotiations in London on 23/24 October, in addition to my officials, Ireland was also represented at industry level.  Unfortunately however, there was little by way of concrete progress.  In large part this was due to the fact that a new Norwegian Fisheries Minister had only been appointed the previous week. One positive aspect was that, again at Ireland&rsquo;s instigation, there was a detailed presentation to, and exchange of views with Member States, from the European Pelagic industry on their proposal. </p><p>  Another round of Coastal State negotiations is now due to take place in Clonakilty from 18-22 November.  Ireland will play a constructive role at those negotiations and will leave no stone unturned in an effort to reach a solution that is balanced and fair to all of the parties.</p></reply>

This application has been refused as my Department is satisfied that approval of a second Studbook would dilute the genetic pool of elite breeding stock and dissipate the scarce available resources to promote the breed&rsquo;s future development. </p><p>  Horse Sport Ireland (HSI) is currently approved by my Department under the relevant legislation to maintain the Irish Draught Horse Studbook.  HSI  has been proactive in ensuring the breeding objectives and the breeding programme for the breed are appropriate, having already taken on board the views of breeders.  </p><p>  In 2008, HSI appointed a Task Force to advise on the appropriate breeding strategy for the Irish Draught Horse. The Task Force included representatives of Irish Draught breeders which were chosen by HSI for their knowledge of Irish Draught breeding and relevant organizations were also invited to contribute. The review included lengthy consultation with all involved in the industry and the Irish Draught Breeding Policy was published in 2010. </p><p>  This  year, Horse Sport Ireland has initiating a further review of its Irish Draught breeding policy in order to determine the effectiveness of the current policy and to make any amendments to the breeding programme which would be in the best interest of the breed.  To assist this process, I understand that an Irish Draught Breeding Policy Review Taskforce is reviewing matters such as the breeding objective for the Studbook, the classification system, the inspection system and suggestions for studbook initiatives to improve the quality and marketing of the breed. </p><p>  This forum is providing a significant opportunity for organizations like the Irish Draught Horse Society to offer its views and advice on future policies and strategies to preserve the breed. The Task Force is the appropriate forum to raise views regarding the adequacy of present policies towards the preservation of the breed. This Taskforce has held one  meeting in October 2013 and a second meeting is being held in the next few days.  I understand the Society was invited to be involved in this process.</p></reply>

The NEWB monitors school attendance nationally and I recently launched the Analysis of School Attendance Data for the 2010/2011 school year.  These data show a continued improvement in student attendance from 2009/2010 and previous years. The number of school days being missed is at the lowest for the five year period 2006/07 &ndash; 2010/11 and the continued positive trend over recent years is to be welcomed.</p><p>  While every incremental improvement represents real progress the number of children who miss school each day remains a significant cause for concern. The report highlights the need for sustained and focussed approaches to supporting student attendance, especially within particular groups in society.  In the case of schools serving disadvantaged areas, the data shows that absences over 20 days in these schools are down 1% on the previous year&rsquo;s figures (2009/10) and 3% from 2008/09. The overall improvements in attendance data in general demonstrate the positive impact of targeted investment programmes and the progress that can be achieved through the collaborative efforts of schools, parents, statutory and support services.</p><p>  Within the NEWB, the Education Welfare Service has specific responsibility for the Board&rsquo;s general statutory function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. I am advised by the NEWB that the Education Welfare Service worked with over 20,000 children in 2012, of which 2,420 were intensive interventions which required sustained support from an Education Welfare Officer and a multidisciplinary approach, in collaboration with schools, families and other services, in order to address the issues underlying poor school attendance.</p><p>  The NEWB is also developing guidelines for schools on the development of school attendance strategies. The guidance will provide practical advice to schools in their task of enabling children to maximise their attendance, participation and retention in schools. The Board intends to complete this work within the current academic year.</p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills DEIS school support programme (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) is part of a continuum of interventions designed to address the needs of 3 to 18 year olds from disadvantaged communities. DEIS adopts an integrated approach with early intervention as a core principle. Designated DEIS schools are supported in developing school based plans to facilitate self-evaluation against a range of self-determined targets, including the setting of targets on school attendance as a prioritised area of activity.  My Department works closely with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that a coherent and consistent approach is taken to effectively target our respective resources to support children at risk of poor school attendance and early school leaving.  In relation to DEIS schools, the NEWB is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service (74 front-line Education Welfare staff); Home School Community Liaison Programme (comprised of 402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (comprised of 124 school cluster projects involving 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools). This integrated model of service will provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools in relation to attendance, participation and retention. I see this strategic national approach as a crucial reform in our efforts to tackle school absenteeism.</p><p>  The amalgamation of the NEWB&rsquo;s services into the new Child and Family Agency upon its establishment will further consolidate the development of services aimed at children and provide opportunities for more effective working amongst the range of professionals involved in such services. The Child and Family Agency will have a specific legislative remit to promote educational outcomes through its educational welfare programmes.

Responsibility for the Children Act, 2001 is shared between the Minister for Justice and Equality and myself with:</p><p>- The Minister for Justice and Equality being responsible for most of the Act which includes youth crime policy and law, including crime prevention, crime reduction, criminal proceedings, diversion and community sanctions (including community projects). Minister Shatter is also responsible for dealings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service as well as responsibility, via the Irish Prison Service, for young people in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</p><p>- I am responsible for the 3 Children Detention Schools at Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin which provide detention places to the Courts for girls up to the age of 18 years and boys up to the age of 17 years ordered to be remanded or committed on criminal charges. I am also responsible for the child care aspects of the Children Act, 2001.</p><p>  The National Youth Justice Oversight Group completed its draft &ldquo;Report on the Implementation of the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010&rdquo; in April, 2012 and it was presented to the Senior Officials Group on Social Policy on 13<sup>th</sup> June, 2012 and to the Cabinet Sub Committee on Social Policy on 1<sup>st</sup> October, 2012.  The report is available on the IYJS website www.iyjs.ie.</p><p>  The Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department is currently finalising its Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018 which will sit within the <i>Children and Young People's Policy Framework (CYPPF) 2014-2018</i> currently being developed in my Department but will also form part of the <i>National Anti-Crime</i>Strategy being developed as part of the draft White Paper on Crime process being finalised by my colleague Minister Shatter.</p><p>  The focus for the forthcoming Plan will be to continue the downward trends in high volume crime and detention; becoming more adept in understanding and intervening in more serious crime offending patterns; and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions in addressing the behaviour and needs of these children. The Plan involves evidence-informed targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, and to reduce crime leading to safer communities. Importantly, the voice and experiences of children involved in the youth justice system have influenced the development of these interventions.</p><p>  The drafting and publication of the plan has been a collaborative effort between my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality.  I believe this collaborative approach provides a solid platform to achieve our shared objectives and I intend to publish the Action Plan in conjunction with Minister Shatter in the very near future.</p></reply>

Under section 26 of the Child Care Act 1991, the Court may appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> to a child who is the subject of care proceedings, if it is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so. They are always appointed where a child is subject to Special Care proceedings.</p><p>  I believe that there is considerable scope to improve the quality, consistency and cost effectiveness of the current service which has evolved in an ad hoc manner over a number of years. I also believe that a much more regularised structure for guardian ad litem services needs to be developed if the role of the GAL is to deliver real value.</p><p>  Officials within my Department are working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality and the HSE with a view to establishing the most appropriate arrangements for the future organisation and delivery of this service.</p></reply>

Orthodontic referrals are generally received via the Public Dental Service school screening programme. An individual's access to orthodontic treatment is determined in accordance with the Modified Index of Treatment Need. The dental health component has five categories ranging from 1 (no need for treatment) to 5 (great need). Further sub-divisions of these categories are substantially based in accordance with the causes of malocclusion, e.g. misalignment of teeth. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment. </p><p>  At the time of assessment those with urgent clinical need are prioritised. It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown below only. The most recent information relates to the third quarter of 2013.<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment </th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>2 - 3 years</th><th>Over 4 years</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td>862</td><td>746</td><td>959</td><td>724</td><td>16</td><td>3,307</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West </td><td>566</td><td>1135</td><td>1165</td><td>1200</td><td>61</td><td>4,127</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South </td><td>326</td><td>963</td><td>495</td><td>1190</td><td>191</td><td>3,165</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>341</td><td>631</td><td>864</td><td>1235</td><td>194</td><td>3,265</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>2,095</td><td>3,475</td><td>3,483</td><td>4,349</td><td>462</td><td>13,864</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I wrote to the HSE on Thursday 31 October to confirm that the Executive has until 15 November to submit its Service Plan. In that letter, I also conveyed to the Executive that my overriding priority is patient safety, with the next priority being to treat patients in as timely a fashion as possible.    A key priority for 2014 will be to further support the eight designated cancer centres, within available resources, to maintain continued improvements in diagnosis, surgery and multi-disciplinary care.</p><p>  I welcome the huge improvements that have been made in recent years, led by the HSE National Cancer Control Programme. It is very encouraging to note that five year relative survival for all cancers is rising and is now 56.4% for people diagnosed between 2003-2007, as compared with 49.6% for people diagnosed in 1998-2002. Clearly 2014 will be a very challenging year for the health services. In meeting this challenge, the goal, wherever possible, is to cut the cost of services rather than the level or quality of the services delivered, and to accelerate the pace of reform. The reform programme for hospitals, as set out in <i>Future Health, </i>  aims to deliver more responsive and equitable access to services for all patients; to organise public hospitals into more efficient and accountable hospital groups, which can deliver better patient care for less cost; and to ensure that smaller hospitals continue to play a key role. </p></reply>

However, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so. </p><p>  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the necessary statutory provisions to fully implement the Directive and draft legal provisions to put in place the statutory provisions for this Directive are being prepared and will be implemented as soon as possible.  Nevertheless, there are administrative arrangements in place in respect of the key provision of the Directive in relation to a national contact point (NCP), which has been set up within the HSE.  The email address is crossborderdirective@hse.ie.</p><p>  The principle function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost, the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the rights, if any, that they may have through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them. Patients&rsquo; requiring information on Ireland's implementation of the Directive may access NCP information on the Cross Border Directive (CBD) through the HSE&rsquo;s main website.</p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness or disability.</p><p>  Under this legislation, the determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Section 45 requires the HSE to have regard to a person's, and their spouse or partner's overall financial situation in view of their reasonable expenditure. The HSE gives effect to this legislation and Government policy through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  Where a person's income is in excess of the income thresholds set out in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE uses its discretion to grant a medical card to a person who is unable, due to undue hardship, to arrange a GP service. In doing so, the HSE is obliged to have regard to the financial situation and expenditure of the individual and his or her dependents. </p><p>  Since the beginning of 2011, the Government has taken measures and provided funding to ensure that an additional quarter of a million people have a medical card. Over 40% of the population now hold a medical card, which is the highest proportion since records began.</p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill in palliative care, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. </p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness in palliative care, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. </p><p>Renewal assessment forms automatically issue to the holders of all medical card or GP visit cards, three months prior to the expiry date of the card.</p></reply>

The data available on the private health insurance market in recent years shows a number of factors which are affecting private health insurance costs.  The reduction in the numbers holding private health insurance, the age profile of those holding private health insurance, increases in claims costs, increases in premiums, and the overall state of the economy are all having an impact on the private health insurance market and its sustainability. </p><p>  I am determined to address rising costs in the private health insurance sector in the interests of consumers.  I want insurers to address their base costs, and have made it clear to insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, ultimately reducing the impact of rising health costs on health insurance premiums for the consumer.  Last year I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, comprising representatives from the private health insurance companies, my Department, and the Health Insurance Authority, to generate ideas to address health insurance costs.  I appointed an independent Chairperson Mr. Pat McLoughlin who is working with my Department and the insurers under the auspices of the Forum on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market and I expect to receive his initial report shortly.</p><p>  While competition is evident in the Irish private health insurance market, insurers have concentrated on competing for younger lives. Competition in a community rated health insurance system needs to be supported by risk equalisation, a mechanism to distribute fairly some of the differences that arise in insurers' costs due to the differing health status of all their customers. There has been a history of challenges to risk equalisation in Ireland, with the original risk equalisation scheme struck down in 2008.   A temporary scheme was introduced in 2009, which I greatly improved in 2012 and I also put in place a permanent scheme of risk equalisation for the first time in 2013.  There is a need to continue developing risk equalisation in order to protect the health insurance market and to ensure competition is on the basis of service and quality, not risk profile and I encourage insurers to compete actively to insure all lives.</p></reply>

The Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2012 provide the statutory basis for the regulation of the health insurance market in the interest of the common good.  At the centre of the common good in a community-rated health insurance market is inter-generational solidarity between all insured persons. Under community rating, everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. The objective has always been that the price of a policy should reflect the risks and costs of the entire pool of insured persons in the community, rather than the risks and costs on a person by person basis and indeed on an insurer by insurer by basis.</p><p>  The pricing of risk across the community of insured persons requires robust mechanisms to share costs when there are a number of insurance companies in the market. If a mechanism to share risk and attendant costs is not present, an insurer with a less profitable risk profile can quickly find themselves in a perilous position financially. The standard transfer mechanism is known as risk equalisation   and it is a key element of health insurance, not just in Ireland but internationally. Risk equalisation is a process that aims to equitably neutralise differences in insurers&rsquo; claim costs that arise due to variations in the health status of their members. The aim of risk equalisation is to look at the market as a whole, and to distribute fairly the differences that arise in insurers&rsquo; costs due to the differing health status of all of their customers. Risk equalisation aims to make health insurance more affordable for older people by supporting community-rated premiums. In general, younger people pay more and older people pay less than what would normally apply in a risk-rated system. </p><p>  I am committed to progressively increasing the extent to which risk equalisation compensates for the costs of insuring older customers.  A permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) was introduced with effect from 1 January, 2013. Prior to the introduction of the permanent RES, an Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy had been in operation from 2009 to 2012. Yesterday I received Government approval to the immediate publication of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013, which sets out revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duties that will apply under the Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 March 2014.  Different risk equalisation credits will apply to 'advanced' and 'non-advanced' health insurance policies. There will be no change to the stamp duty payable on lower cost 'non-advanced' health insurance, which will help to ensure that the option of lower cost health insurance remains available. The stamp duty for health insurance products providing 'advanced' cover will increase from &euro;350 to &euro;399 per adult and from &euro;120 to &euro;135 per child. This will help direct support, in the form of higher risk equalisation credits, where it is needed most and will subsidise health insurance for the most vulnerable patients. Under the Health Insurance Acts, I set the rates for risk equalisation credits and the Minister for Finance sets the rate of stamp duty require to fund those credits.      </p><p>  These measures will ensure that we continue to protect community rated health insurance, which is a vital part of our health system, now and in the future as we move to Universal Health Insurance.</p></reply>

I wrote to the HSE on Thursday 31 October to confirm that the Executive has until 15 November to submit its Service Plan. In that letter, I also conveyed to the Executive that my overriding priority is patient safety, with the next priority being to treat patients in as timely a fashion as possible. A key priority for 2014 will be to further support the eight designated cancer centres, within available resources, to maintain continued improvements in diagnosis, surgery and multi-disciplinary care.</p><p>  Clearly, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer is a high priority for my Department and the HSE. I welcome the huge improvements that have been made in recent years, led by the HSE National Cancer Control Programme. It is very encouraging to note that five year relative survival for all cancers is rising and is now 56.4% for people diagnosed between 2003-2007, as compared with 49.6% for people diagnosed in 1998-2002. The HSE has established symptomatic breast clinics and rapid access, lung and prostate clinics in each of the eight cancer centres. Performance of these clinics is monitored through the collection of key performance indicators. The HSE has advised that in Q3 2013, access targets for both urgent and routine referrals to breast cancer clinics are being exceeded in the designated cancer centres in aggregate (95%).  In relation to access to lung cancer clinics, 94.9% of patients in Q3 2013 in aggregate were offered an appointment within 10 working days, just under the target of 95%. While further progress is required in relation to access targets for prostate cancer clinics in Q3, the percentage of patients being offered an appointment within the target time is 50.2%, up from 47% last year.   All referrals to these centres are triaged and urgent cases are prioritised and appointments offered to all appropriate patients in the first instance.</p><p>  With regard to paediatric cancer care, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin is the national tertiary paediatric and adolescent referral centre for all cancer services. I am advised that children are treated according to international protocols and standards of care, that all care is clinically prioritised by consultants and that there are no extraordinary delays for children accessing cancer services. </p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's query regarding the number of instances reported whereby patients seeking treatment for cancer have been put on waiting lists, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly on this. </p></reply>

Intensive work is underway in all hospitals to pursue compliance with the European Working Time Directive on junior doctors&rsquo; working-hours. The immediate focus, involving the HSE, hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs, is on eliminating shifts in excess of 24 hours.</p><p>  In July this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs.  I see this as a modernising initiative which is needed urgently and which will, in future years, support the retention of sufficient numbers of doctors trained in Ireland within the system. </p><p>  The great majority of NCHD posts are filled at present. However there are a limited number of vacancies, mainly in smaller hospitals and in certain specialties, including Emergency Medicine and General Medicine at Registrar level. Filling these posts represents a challenge given that there are shortages internationally, there is a competitive market and that it can be more difficult to attract doctors to some hospitals than others.</p><p>  Where sites continue to experience challenges in terms of vacancies, hospital management implement contingency plans. If necessary, hospitals make locum arrangements to ensure continued service delivery. System reform, in particular the implementation of the Report on Hospital Groups and the Framework for the Development of Smaller Hospitals will assist in achievement of a more focused and efficient deployment of NCHD staffing.  These changes will build on the significant work that has been done through the HSE National Clinical programmes in recent years. </p></reply>

Staff appointments may be made only where an inescapable service need has been identified and which cannot be addressed by other means, such as the redeployment of staff or reorganisation of services. </p><p>  Notwithstanding these restrictions, I am satisfied that sufficient nursing capacity can be provided throughout the public health service.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2013- 2016 (The Haddington Road Agreement) provides for health service staff to increase their working hours.  The value ascribed to this element of the Agreement is in the region of five million hours annually for the health workforce as a whole.  In the case of nurses and midwives, the standard working-week has increased from 37.5 to 39 hours.   Given the number of nurses and midwives in the public health service (about one-third of the workforce), these additional working-hours represent significant additional capacity. </p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement also provides for the implementation of the Graduate Nurse/Midwife Placement Initiative on an agreed basis with the health unions.  Staff are currently being appointed under this scheme.  In addition, as part of the 2014 Estimates process, it has been agreed that the HSE will establish a Nurse Bank. This measure will improve the continuity of nurse-provided care and will also reduce reliance on agency staffing.</p><p>  The Report of the Review of the Undergraduate Nursing and Midwifery Degree Programmes, published in 2012, found that the numbers of nurses and midwives currently being trained are sufficient to meet current demand. The Report also recommended that a five year workforce plan, to be reviewed regularly, should be undertaken by the HSE in co-operation with the Department of Health, taking into account the extent of change planned under the reform agenda and economic considerations referred to above.  I can confirm to the Deputy that the HSE has commenced this process. </p></reply>

The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction. This policy requires the health service to reduce its workforce to just under 98,000 wholetime equivalent employees (WTE) by the end of 2014.</p><p>  Earlier this year my Department authorised the introduction of a Targeted Voluntary Redundancy (VR) Scheme in the HSE and in organisations funded by the HSE under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  The purpose of the scheme is to achieve a permanent reduction in numbers and to facilitate on-going health sector reform. The HSE will determine the areas and functions where there is scope to reduce employee numbers in the context of changing health sector structures and roles, for example, as a result of implementation of productivity measures provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement.</p><p>  The scheme will be implemented on a rolling basis as appropriate areas and functions are identified.  Employees in the areas targeted will be given an opportunity to avail of the scheme but there will be no automatic right to redundancy. </p><p>  The HSE will operate the Targeted Voluntary Redundancy Scheme in 2014 and subsequent years as a key element in the reform of the health service. It will enable the HSE and other service providers to maximise the quantum and quality of services provided within the resources available.</p></reply>
