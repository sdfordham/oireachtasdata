I have to be conscious in regard to the safe operation of the Harbour at all times. In this context, traffic management and parking is recognised as an issue, particularly, though not exclusively, during the busy holiday periods.  Uniquely among Fishery Harbour Centres, a wide range of groups use the parking facilities of Howth Fishery Harbour &ndash; harbour business customers, yacht club members, sport fishermen, Dart users, tourists, walkers and many others.  For the record, pay parking is already in operation in two other Fishery Harbour Centres.</p><p>  As I have said, funding for operating, management and ongoing development costs of the Fishery Harbour Centres is a consideration for my Department, ensuring that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially-sound basis, is extremely important.  I am well aware of and acknowledge the concerns of local residents and harbour users; I will take appropriate account of their views in coming to my decision.</p></reply>

The RDP must be submitted to the European Commission for approval. </p><p>  GLAS is designed around core requirements which all applicants must satisfy.  A tiered approach is being applied to entry into the Scheme and the tiers are based on a consideration of priority environmental assets and actions.  In the first instance all farmers in the Measure must comply with the following list of core requirements:</p><p> (a) A Farm Advisory Service (FAS) approved agricultural planner must prepare GLAS application.</p><p> (b) Nutrient Management Plan for whole farm must be in place before payment issues.</p><p> (c) Knowledge Transfer by means of a training course for specific actions complemented by on-line demonstrations/advice on good environmental practices.</p><p> (d) Record keeping.</p><p>The tiered approach will give priority to farmers with environmental assets such as Natura site, farmland habitats and high status water areas. </p><p>  The proposed maximum payment is &euro;5,000 per annum, with the Scheme building up to the inclusion of some 50,000 farmers with a total envisaged expenditure of &euro;1,450m over the programming period.  It is also proposed that, within budget limits, a GLAS+ payment would be put in place for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions which deliver an exceptional level of environmental benefit.  It is proposed that this payment will be up to &euro;2,000 per annum.  </p><p>  As far as TAMS II is concerned, the recent consultation paper published by my Department sets out a number of priorities in the case of possible on-farm investment schemes under the new Rural Development Programme.  These include further support to encourage investment in the dairy sector in view of the forthcoming abolition of milk quotas; an enhanced scheme of grant-aid for young farmers; investment in low-emission slurry-spreading equipment; improvements in certain pig and poultry facilities; bio-energy; and a new farm building measure to support the construction of animal housing and slurry storage.</p><p>  I intend to include further details in relation to these grants in the Rural Development Programme itself when it is finalised in the near future.  EU Commission approval for the Programme will be required before any new national measures are introduced on the basis of the Programme.  Accordingly, it is not possible at this stage to fix definitive dates for the introduction of the schemes concerned.  In the case of both schemes, however, more detailed information will be made public very shortly, as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-08a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050800029#WRA01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 21 together.</p><p>  The purpose of the roundtable discussions with key stakeholders in the beef sector (which included representatives from IFA, ICMSA, ICSA, MII, Teagasc and Bord Bia) that I hosted on 17 April was to reflect on recent developments in the sector and set out a series of actions that will aid viability across the supply chain in light of current market conditions. I believe that it was a worthwhile exercise and the constructive engagement of participants confirmed my belief that ongoing dialogue and collaboration, supported by the Government, is essential to improving the interdependent relationship between and producers and processors. The positive outcome of the roundtable discussions is reflected in the various measures announced at its conclusion. </p><p>  These included a commitment to launching a &lsquo;Beef Pricewatch&rsquo; online tool to make price information more accessible and free of charge to farmers. No decision has yet been made regarding the specific IT solution or the platform on which it will be delivered to clients. At present, my officials are reviewing the full range of existing price data and whether it should be supplemented before considering how best it might be made available online &ndash; whether by a specific website, app or other format. It will also be necessary to take account of the time needed for software development. Progress on this matter will be reported to a future meeting of the beef roundtable once a decision has been made on what information will be included in the service, how it will be delivered to farmers and the timeframe for implementation.</p><p>  In addition to price transparency, both the farmer and meat processors representatives made statements regarding the role of the specifications for young bull production and the impact these have on the market situation. I am aware therefore of the importance all sides place on these specifications and the misunderstanding that can arise as to their impact on cattle prices. As these views were diametrically opposed to each other I have asked Mr. Michael Dowling, Chairman of the Beef 2020 Activation Group to look at the role that specifications play in the young bull production and prices. I expect that he will make a report on this matter at the next roundtable discussion on 3 June.</p><p>  After the roundtable discussion, I released a press statement which sets out the following measures that the forum agreed will assist in addressing the challenges facing the sector:</p><p>  - The roundtable will reconvene quarterly to exchange intelligence on market developments and forecasts particularly in relation to supply, demand, prices, product specifications, retail changes etc; </p><p>  - In addition to his work on specification I have requested the Chairman of the Beef 2020 Activation Group, Mr. Michael Dowling, to review implementation of the Group&rsquo;s report. He is meeting all stakeholders individually to consider what further actions, including the possible role of long-term supply contracts for producers, and will report back to the me by the end of May;</p><p>  - My Department will prioritise its targeted on-farm capital investments for suckler farmers through the new Rural Development Programme;</p><p>  - Bord Bia will allocate &euro;0.5m to expand and target promotion of Irish beef through its campaigns in the UK and in certain continental markets;</p><p>  - Teagasc will intensify its efforts to enable farmers to maximise on-farm efficiencies through lowering input costs and increasing output value to deliver a better margin for suckler farmers and finishers. This assistance will include advice on adapting productions systems to meet market specifications; &amp;amp;</p><p>  - I undertook to engage further with my Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on issues relevant to the sector including cross-border trade.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that one of my priorities since taking office has been the continued development of the beef sector. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the primary production in the sector is evidenced by an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014 allied with a number of progressive schemes to be implemented over the lifetime of the new RPD. Taken together with the leadership provided by my roundtable initiative, beef farmers have the necessary supports to enhance the profitability and sustainability of their livestock enterprises.</p></reply>

The Control of Horses Act, 1996 was introduced to address serious problems being caused by straying horses wandering onto public roads and lands and posing risks to the public, especially motorists, young children and property (both public and private). Local authorities have responsibility for implementing the Act and I, as Minister for Agriculture, provide financial assistance under the Act to local authorities towards expenses incurred in implementation of the Act. I am pleased to say that my Department provided &euro;3.025m to local authorities for this purpose in 2013.</p><p>Both I and my Department support all efforts towards re-homing of horses but, unfortunately, it is not possible to re-home all horses because of the substantial numbers involved and the cost of keeping a horse, including stabling facilities, veterinary expenses, feed and farriery fees. Nevertheless, my Department offers local authorities &euro;200 towards the cost of re-homing of each horse and, in an effort to ensure increased re-homing of unwanted horses, I have specifically increased funding for 2014 to those animal welfare organisations involved in horse welfare activities to ensure sufficient resources are available to cater for any difficulties arising in the area of horse welfare over the coming year.  In this regard, the overall amount provided in respect of 2014 is &euro;1.8m, of which &euro;210,000 is being provided to both the ISPCA and the DSPCA to enable these organisations to continue their work in rescuing horses and absorb some costs associated with re-homing horses. </p><p>My Department continues to stress that it is the responsibility of horse owners to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership and/or their care and to dispose of them appropriately. My Department will, in conjunction with the local authorities and An Garda Siochana, continue to adopt a pro-active approach in relation to horse welfare and will remove at-risk animals and, where appropriate, institute prosecution relating to any maltreatment of these animals. The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which places clear obligations on owners regarding the need to look after animals in their care. My Department has been operating an Animal Welfare Helpline for some time with a view to enabling persons who are concerned about the welfare of horses or indeed any animal to contact the Department at email and on lo-call 1850 211 990.</p><p>I am pleased to be able to say that the over-supply situation has significantly eased in recent years following a substantial decline in the number of foals born in 2012 and 2013 and on-going high levels of slaughterings, leading to supply coming more into line with demand.  Over the past month, I have attended a number of meetings arranged by HSI, Teagasc and the RDS, involving horse breeders with a view to drawing up a strategy for the sport horse industry.  These meetings were well attended and stakeholders displayed a clear willingness to develop an economically viable and sustainable industry in the years ahead.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-08a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050800029#WRA01500"><p>In the context of the ongoing review of land eligibility being conducted by my Department some farmers may want to clear areas of scrub, thereby restoring the land to full eligibility. Those farmers should be aware, however, that in the context of CAP Reform, recent decisions which I have taken provide protection for the payments of farmers. In the first instance, a decision was made to use 2013 eligible land &ndash; or 2015 if it is lower &ndash; for the calculation of number of new payment entitlements. This means that the number of entitlements allocated to farmers should correspond to the number of eligible hectares on the holding. In addition, the total value of the new entitlements allocated to farmers in 2015 will be based on the total number of entitlements - rather than payments - owned by farmers in 2014. Therefore, there is no reason why such farmers cannot fully benefit from payments under the CAP Reform regime from 2015 onwards.  </p><p>  Having said that, it is open to farmers to remove scrub to restore the eligibility of land, although there are a number of matters that they must bear in mind when considering such a course of action. In the first instance, certain lands are designated as habitats under Natura 2000 areas, namely Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protection Areas (SPA). These lands are protected under national and EU legislation. Where lands are so designated, scrub removal is prohibited without prior approval from the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Failure to abide by the requirements could result in farmers facing penalties under the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC). At all times, my Department has tried to assist farmers. For example, REPS farmers on exiting the Scheme are encouraged to retain newly created REPS habitats after the ending of the REPS Scheme. If they do so, these areas, which are referred to as &ldquo;Designated Habitats&rdquo; are eligible to benefit from payment under the Single Farm Payment Scheme and under the new Basic Payment Scheme from 2015. </p><p>  For scrub removal by burning it is imperative to note that this can only be done at certain times of the year and in a controlled fashion.  It is also important to state that there are very real risks for farmers and other land owners associated with uncontrolled burning. Setting fire to growing vegetation is not only an extremely dangerous practice, it can also be illegal. I would remind land owners and the public that it is illegal to burn growing vegetation on uncultivated land between 1 March and 31 August and asked all rural dwellers to be vigilant for fire, to report any suspicious activity to the Gardai and to report any uncontrolled or unattended fires to the Fire Service.</p></reply>

Both laboratories are experienced in testing for this disease and both confirmed the presence of the disease in accordance with internationally approved diagnostic protocols.  The decision to fell the larch was not taken lightly but was based on the best scientific practice in trying to limit further sporulation and spread of the disease. Copies of the laboratory reports from both laboratories confirming the detection of the disease can be made available to Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></reply>

The Shellfish Pot Replacement Scheme administered by BIM is providing 40% of the cost of replacing these lost pots through fixed payments of &euro;24 per lobster/crab pot and &euro;12 per shrimp pot.  By the closing date of 28 March 2014, BIM had received 151 applications.  Two were excluded as invalid as the vessels concerned were not registered sea-fishing boats.  116 applications have been approved, while a further 33 applications require further information.  It is expected that the Scheme will cost approximately &euro;170,000.</p><p>  I am acutely conscious of the difficult time experienced by fishermen in the early months of this year.  In addition to introducing the Shellfish Pot Replacement Scheme, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the very significant funds I have made available to assist the fishing and aquaculture sectors with the impacts of the storms on piers, harbours and other coastal infrastructure, on which the fishing and aquaculture sectors rely.  On 20 March 2014, I announced a &euro;23 million package for the repair of public owned piers, harbours and slipways damaged during the winter storms and for investment in the ongoing development of Ireland&rsquo;s public harbour network.  &euro;8.5m of this funding will assist 11 Local Authorities and my Department to repair 115 storm damaged piers and harbours and coastal infrastructure.  A further &euro;14.63 million has been committed to my Department&rsquo;s 2014 harbours investment programme as part of an ongoing and long term strategy to develop and improve the facilities at our Fishery Harbour Centres and other public harbours around our coast.</p><p>  This &euro;23 million investment will repair the storm damage to our vitally important fisheries piers and harbours network and will develop our harbours for the benefit of our seafood industry and the coastal communities dependent on this infrastructure.  This package will help to ensure that this important infrastructure is fit for purpose in the modern era and will bring significant added value to local communities and much welcome jobs and economic activity.  I am acutely conscious of the needs of our important inshore fishing sector and am actively reviewing how the interests of the inshore fishing sector can best be addressed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-08a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050800029#WRA02100"><p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department attaches considerable importance to the live export trade and, over the years, has been very active in facilitating shipments abroad. The live trade serves a dual purpose in providing alternative market outlets for beef farmers; it meets a demand for suitable livestock in foreign markets while providing increased competition for cattle in the domestic market. The reality is that the live trade to the UK is open for business as shown by the data generated by my Department&rsquo;s AIM database. In fact, total live exports to the UK for the year to date have reached 19,000 head, an increase of some 3,800 head or 25% up on the comparable period in 2013. Live exports to Northern Ireland, which account for the vast majority of the UK live trade, amounted to over 14,000 head up to week 17 (w/c 27 April), which represents an increase of 1,700 head or 14% on the 2013 figure. Most of the Northern trade consists of stores and finished cattle.</p><p>  However, the potential to grow the live trade to the UK is constrained by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market. The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately. This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. </p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term. Nevertheless Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner. </p><p>  One solution that been suggested is to apply to the EU Commission for a Protected Geographical Indication for all Irish beef. For such an application to be successful, it would be necessary to demonstrate that the same characteristics countrywide in terms of geographical/human factors are the causal link in creating this one unique product. An obvious issue would be beef from Northern Ireland and how similar/different the geographical/human factors are for this beef. Although it is possible to have GI registration for product that crosses different legal jurisdictions, the product has to be the same product produced in the same way and one whose uniqueness can be shown to be causally linked to the geographical area.   </p><p>  Furthermore, origin label requirements present difficulties for an all-island approach. GI names are protected and other products cannot use their names or imply that they are like them. However, under labelling rules, beef must be labelled with the Member State of origin. The Commission is concerned that there would be a contradiction between these requirements. In any event, with mandatory origin labelling continuing to apply, there is no guarantee that such an application, even if successful, would have any impact on the purchasing policy of British multiples. </p><p>  Arising from the roundtable discussions with key stakeholders that I hosted on 17 April, I announced number of measures to address the challenges currently facing the overall beef sector, including the allocation by Bord Bia of &euro;0.5m to expand and target the promotion of Irish beef through its campaigns in the UK and in certain Continental markets, and an improvement in the presentation of market intelligence for farmers by my Department. I have also indicated that I will continue to engage with my Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on issues relevant to producers including cross-border trade, and have asked Mr. Michael Dowling, Chairman of the Beef  Activation Group, to review progress on the development of the sector. His report will  examine issues facing the beef industry, and will cover a range of issues, including trade in live animals, and will be presented to the next round table meeting in early June.</p></reply>

The closing date for receipt of applications was 31 December 2001.  The sole purpose of the Scheme was to provide an opportunity to families, who lost a vessel between 1980 and 1990 to sustain or maintain a family tradition in sea-fishing. Successful applicants were awarded the capacity of the lost vessel in the form of gross tonnes and kilowatts.  </p><p>As you know, the Ombudsman carried out an examination and investigation into the Lost at Sea Scheme following a complaint received.

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year. Details of these inspections and the regulations involved are published in the Terms and Conditions of the schemes which are sent to every applicant annually.</p><p>  These inspections are a necessary requirement in order to draw down approximately &euro;1.7 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances. The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office and this ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements. In abiding with the findings of these audits my Department ensures that these inspections are conducted in a fair and equitable manner and in full accordance with the legislative provisions. Furthermore inspecting officers are very experienced and are regularly trained to ensure that they carry out inspections in a professional manner, with a process of continuous oversight by supervisors and random verification of inspections to ensure a fair and consistent approach. In implementing the inspection programme, my Department takes maximum possible account of the realities of farming. </p><p>  A comprehensive appeal mechanism is in place in order to protect the interests of famers who have difficulties with the inspection findings or who consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements. This appeal system incorporates the option for a farmer to initially seek to have the inspection outcome reviewed internally by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer. Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman, which brings an entirely external and visibly independent dimension to the process.</p></reply>

This investment has resulted in a significant improvement in the electrical infrastructure available, the traffic management system and the access available to persons of reduced mobility.

Programmes and activities are developed in conjunction with clients and partners overseen by an Authority that is representative of the main stakeholder groups in the agri-food sector. They employ over 1,100 staff in 50 locations throughout the country. The distribution of staff between services is an operational matter for Teagasc management to determine. </p><p>  The education function works in partnership with many other education stakeholders including Universities, Institutes of Technology and others, to deliver quality-driven education and training courses in agriculture, food, horticulture, forestry and equine studies. Courses are delivered through a network of agricultural colleges, regional and local education centres and in collaboration with 3 privately owned colleges. It is a matter for Teagasc to prioritise activities in the delivery of education services and to allocate resources in accordance with these priorities. </p><p>  My Department has responded positively to the demand that has arisen for additional college places in recent years sanctioning a number of exceptional appointments in the agricultural colleges. Teagasc was granted sanction in 2011 to recruit 6 contract teachers to cope with staff shortages and increased demand for college places. At the same time, Teagasc introduced a number of complementary initiatives to maximise student participation including increased student-teacher ratios, redeployment of advisory staff to the agricultural colleges and subcontracting the delivery of specific education modules across a number of colleges and local centres. A further 6 teaching posts were approved in 2012 to cover short term absences in the colleges. </p><p>  More recently, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, approved the recruitment of 11 new staff in Teagasc in respect of posts deemed mission critical by the organisation, which included 3 posts in the education function. In addition to recruitment posts, Teagasc has also been sanctioned to fill critical gaps in the education function by way of internal promotions. </p><p>  The increased interest in formal training reflects the very positive view of the agricultural sector as it has evolved in recent years. Food Harvest 2020 and the removal of milk quotas provide additional momentum to the need for a highly educated and motivated workforce. Teagasc is committed to developing its education programmes to ensure that they are responsive to the needs of the agri-food sector.  For example, the Teagasc Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management was developed and introduced in response to Food Harvest 2020 recommendations and subsequent implementation group reports which flagged the need for further training opportunities for future dairy farm managers. The new award, which is validated by UCD, has close on forty trainees participating. It should also be recognized that Teagasc&rsquo;s national network of Discussion Groups make an increasingly important contribution to education providing ongoing structured learning opportunities to close on 14,000 producers annually. </p><p>  I should also say that all of this takes place within the context of a moratorium on public service recruitment which has significantly reduced the public service pay bill. Within the parameters of that over arching policy, the question of whether to seek sanction to fill particular posts remains an operational matter for Teagasc.</p></reply>

This policy aims to limit the spread of TB infection between badgers and between badgers and cattle, and as a result, reduce thei role of badgers as a vector of infection to the local cattle population. It is widely recognised among the scientific community that TB is maintained independently in both cattle and badgers that share the same environment and that there is interspecies transmission.  This leads to spill back to cattle leading to recurring bovine to bovine disease.</p><p>Under the wildlife strategy, badgers are removed in areas where they are associated with serious TB breakdowns in cattle.  Badgers are captured under licence, issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, where they are implicated in an outbreak of TB in cattle. Capturing is undertaken only in areas where serious outbreaks of Bovine Tuberculosis have been identified in cattle herds and where an epidemiological investigation carried out by the Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate has found that badgers are the likely source of infection. Despite considerable research in both Ireland and the U.K., no test on live badgers has proven efficacious in reliably detecting TB infected badgers.  </p><p>Badgers are protected by national legislation and are listed within the Berne Convention.  The legislation stipulates that local populations cannot be exterminated and that badger habitats (setts) cannot be destroyed.  Capturing of badgers is not permitted during the breeding season, the months of February and March, in new capture areas.  In addition, it should be noted that the Irish Wildlife Trust submitted a complaint to the Council of Europe in 2012 about the threat to the badger population posed by the Department&rsquo;s culling policy. This complaint was rejected by the Council which concluded that the <i>&quot;densities are higher than in mainland Europe and the species is not threatened nationally or locally. The policy is to keep population at safe low levels, far from causing the species to be threatened.&rdquo;</i></p></reply>

However the Commission proposal which involved a move to a &lsquo;flat-rate&rsquo; payment by 2019 would have had a sudden and significant negative impact on agricultural production. As an alternative I proposed the &lsquo;Irish Convergence Model&rsquo; which while initially retaining the link with current payments under the Single Payment Scheme, gradually moves all farmers towards, but does not arrive at, a national average value by 2019. The purpose of this model is to achieve a phased redistribution of payments between those who currently hold high value entitlements and those who hold low value entitlements. It introduces a fair and equitable re-distribution of funds between farmers while avoiding the negative impact of a sudden and significant change in income support for individual farmers. An additional safety net is added for those with low value entitlements whereby by 2019 they are guaranteed that they will reach at least 60% of the national average entitlement value.  </p><p>  My Department has used stocking density as one measure of agricultural productivity.  While stocking density does not represent all the elements of agricultural productivity, it is a tangible and precise measurement of activity where data from my Department is readily available. Previous analysis by my Department has found that, using average results per payment category, farmers on payment rates per hectare above the national average have roughly double the stocking density of those below the average. I am satisfied therefore that for most farmers there is a fundamental correlation between stocking density and the value of payment entitlements held under the current Single Payment Scheme. </p><p>  However, our analysis also shows that the stocking density of farms on the very highest payment rates (e.g. over &euro;500 per hectare) is not significantly higher than the stocking density of farms just above the national average.  In this regard, I have decided to apply a cap on the payment per hectare under the new scheme whereby by 2019 no farmer will receive a payment per hectare, consisting of his Basic Payment and Greening payment, of over &euro;700.</p><p>  The outcome is a reasonable and balanced compromise between the need for a fair redistribution of funds while ensuring that such distribution continues to reflect the realities of agricultural production in Ireland. The decision to apply the greening payment as a percentage of each individual farmer&rsquo;s payment is based on the same principles.</p></reply>

The GLAS Scheme will provide significant funding to farmers who undertake environmental actions in line with national and EU environmental objectives.  It will contribute to the overall public good and will build on the success of previous agri-environment schemes.</p><p>  The entire Rural Development Programme must be submitted to the European Commission for approval.  Public consultation, an ex ante evaluation, a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats), a needs assessment, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and an appropriate assessment (AA) are mandatory requirements in the development of the Programme.  An independent evaluator has been contracted to prepare the ex ante evaluation report, SEA and AA and to advise on the SWOT analysis. </p><p>  Stakeholder consultation has been a central element in the development of the new RDP.  A number of different formal and informal consultation processes which included the farming organisations have taken place.  The most recently completed stakeholder consultation centred on my announcement of proposed RDP measures and the allocation of national funding in January 2014.  As part of this process I published a consultation document on the new Rural Development Programme, which sets out a range of proposed measures for inclusion.</p><p>  Work on the development of the GLAS Scheme is well advanced and detailed proposals will be published shortly after which further consultation with the farming social partners will take place. Formal proposals will then be submitted to the European Commission for consideration and approval.  The new Scheme adopts a tiered approach to applications, giving priority access to certain actions which address specific environmental issues.  These priorities are targeted towards actions which mitigate climate change, enhance biodiversity and address water quality.  The Scheme will be governed by selection criteria, as is required under all EU funded schemes.</p><p>  Once the Scheme is approved by the European Commission, all GLAS documentation, including the Terms and Conditions, application procedure and selection criteria will be published.</p></reply>

To prevent the further spread of the disease, control measures were implemented in accordance with Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine protocols. Felling the infected trees is the appropriate measure with the aim of preventing further spread by limiting spore production.  The company has advised that harvesting is still ongoing but it is estimated that close on 8,000 cubic metres will be harvested, with an additional wind-blow volume of approximately 500 cubic metres which needs to be removed.</p><p>  In relation to the use of the proceeds from the harvesting, the company has confirmed that there will be reinvestment into the Park and advised that the area will be replanted and that repairs are also needed on some trails and the road.

I conveyed to the Deputy earlier this week that 70% of the volume felled in Gougane Barra was Larch and that the remaining 30% was made up of Lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce.  As regards the age of the trees, the company advise that the trees involved were planted between 1939 and 1942 with approximately 0.5 hectares of younger infected Larch and Lodgepole pine planted in 1989.</p></reply>

In order that payments to farmers within each Member State respected the Net Ceiling, payment entitlements were subjected to a modulation deduction on 10% on all amounts in excess &euro;5,000 and 14% on amount paid in excess of &euro;300,000. </p><p>  Following the agreement on the CAP Reform Package, Ireland&rsquo;s new National Ceiling was fixed at &euro;1,216.5 million A key issue was that the outcome of the CAP negotiations protected the overall Irish national ceiling, which was one of my key objectives during the negotiations, and preserved it at &euro;1,200 million approx and avoided the type of major cut that would have affected farmers&rsquo; incomes. As the modulation deduction no longer applies under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme it was necessary to provide for a linear reduction to payment entitlements in order to ensure compliance with the new 2014 National Ceiling of &euro;1,216.5 million. This was achieved under the provisions of EU Regulation 1310/2013.  The Commission&rsquo;s original proposal was a linear reduction should be applied to all entitlements irrespective of their value. I disagreed with these proposals and sought to retain the old modulation status quo whereby the linear reduction would simply apply to entitlements in excess of &euro;5,000. </p><p>  Despite our best efforts during the negotiations it was not possible to retain the existing mechanism. However, Ireland did manage to persuade the Commission to include a discretionary provision in the 2014 Regulation to enable Member States to exclude from the linear reduction the activated entitlements held by farmers, who claimed &euro;5,000 or less under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme. I decided to implement this provision in order to protect smaller-scale producers in Ireland. For reasons of equity, I also decided that any farmer who claimed in excess of &euro;5,000 would receive a minimum entitlement value of &euro;5,000 and would not fall below that figure. For example, a farmer claiming &euro;5,200 should receive &euro;4,655 in 2014 if the linear reduction was applied in full but is now guaranteed a minimum payment of &euro;5,000. This brought the proposed reduction (excluding financial discipline) to 10.39% but protected farmers at just over &euro;5,000 entitlement value and below from the worst effects of the cut.  </p><p>  In effect, this means that a farmer who was paid &euro;4,999 in 2013 will be paid &euro;4,999 in 2014 and where paid &euro;5,001 in 2013 will be paid &euro;5,000 in 2014. Those paid &euro;10,000, &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000 were paid &euro;9,500, &euro;45,500 and &euro;90,500 in 2013 and will be paid respectively &euro;8,970 (a 5.3% reduction), &euro;44,850 (a 1.3% reduction) and &euro;89,700 (a 0.8% reduction) in 2014. The further data on farmer numbers sought by the Deputy is being extracted and will be supplied directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Its aim is to transform the lives of the most vulnerable and marginalised by working with local civil society organisations, including faith-based organisations and churches. </p><p>Irish Aid has provided funding to Tearfund Ireland to support projects in development education, long-term development and humanitarian assistance. In 2009, the organisation received funding for a small development education project in Ireland.  It received no funding in 2010.  In 2011, a three-year project addressing HIV/Aids in Malawi was approved for funding.  Funding to this project was disbursed in two tranches, in 2011 and 2013.  In 2012, Irish Aid provided funding to the organisation to respond to the food security and nutritional needs of communities in Myanmar.  Details of the funding amounts provided to Tearfund Ireland in the years 2009-2013 are set out below.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount &euro;</th><th>Grant Type </th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;4,000</td><td>Development Education </td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;0</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;194,600</td><td>Civil Society Fund &ndash; HIV/Aids project Malawi</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;200,000</td><td>Emergency Preparedness and Post Recovery Fund &ndash; for Myanmar.</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;393,400</td><td>Civil Society Fund &ndash; HIV/Aids project Malawi</td></tr></table></p><p>Under the 2014 Irish Aid Civil Society Fund, Tearfund Ireland has been approved in principle for a two-year project in Ethiopia with locally-based community groups, to address chronic food insecurity and poverty.  Prior to the establishment of Tearfund Ireland, Irish Aid provided development funding to Tearfund UK.  In the years 2008-2011, Tearfund UK received a total of &euro;1.23 million for development programmes in Ethiopia and Malawi.</p><p>Irish Aid&rsquo;s civil society policy aims to support civil society organisations to build a national and global constituency for development, human rights and social justice.  Partnership with civil society organisations is built on a shared commitment to common values, including human rights and gender equality.  Funding applications from organisations are assessed based on a range of criteria, including the commitment to human rights principles.  All NGOs applying for funding must clearly set out their approach to the selection of partners and the key principles governing partnerships with other organisations.  Activities such as evangelisation and proselytisation are specifically excluded from eligibility for funding from Irish Aid.    </p><p>In order to ensure accountability, all NGOs funded by Irish Aid must have a formal decision-making structure in place which can take legal responsibility for the administration and use of public funds.  As part of the Irish Aid funding assessment process, the governance, management and financial systems of the organisation are appraised.  Irish Aid also requires NGOs to submit an annual narrative and financial report for review.  This report must clearly outline progress against the agreed results for the project funded.  An independent appraisal of the report is undertaken and any issues arising must be resolved before the project can proceed further.   </p><p>Irish Aid also undertakes field monitoring visits as part of its monitoring strategy.  A monitoring visit to a Tearfund UK project in Malawi was undertaken in 2010, which included meetings with the country office team, members of the Malawi Churches Partnership Programme, with which Tearfund had partnered, and with the direct beneficiaries of the project.  The project was seen to be progressing well in line with the outcomes envisaged.</p></reply>

In line with international best practice and the principles of sustainability and ownership for development, Irish Aid values partnership with government and multilateral organizations and with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Participation and collaboration with local organisations is critical in designing and managing overseas development programmes which are relevant to the local context.    Irish Aid requires its partner organisations to demonstrate commitment to transparency, accountability and effective and efficient use of public funds. Prior to approval of grants, all proposals and applicant organisations are assessed by Irish Aid.  Grant applicants are required to meet eligibility criteria in terms of technical capacity, governance, management and accounting systems.  Where relevant, an NGOs&rsquo; capacity to manage onward granting of funds and to ensure appropriate oversight of expenditure is also assessed.  </p><p>  NGOs funded by Irish Aid must have a formal decision-making structure which can take legal responsibility for the administration and use of public funds.  In addition, NGOs are required to have appropriate risk management systems in place to monitor and mitigate against risk, including the risk associated with partnership grant management.  In this way Irish Aid aims to ensure that the systems and processes are in place for full accountability and transparency in the use of public funds provided to NGOs.  All organisations in receipt of Irish Aid grants must also submit independently audited financial accounts.</p><p>  Where Irish Aid funding is on-granted by an NGO to other implementing partners, the NGO management is required to satisfy themselves as to the suitability of the implementing partner to carry out this role.  In particular, details must be set out by the applicant organisation regarding its principles and approach to the selection of partners.  A written agreement between the organisation directly funded by Irish Aid and its implementing partners is expected to set out the respective roles and responsibilities and ensure clarity as to funding arrangements.</p><p>  Each NGO is required to report annually to Irish Aid on progress towards expected results.  Irish Aid maintains regular oversight of partnership performance and on-granting of funds through review of annual narrative reports, expenditure reports and annual audited accounts and risk registers.  NGOs are also subject to field monitoring visits by representatives of Irish Aid.  Terms of reference for such visits would normally include a review of sub-granting agreements and systems in place to monitor and track performance of the relevant partner organisations.</p></reply>

Our international development policy clearly states that the Government remains committed to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP in Official Development Assistance (ODA), and to making further progress towards achieving it as soon as economic circumstances permit.</p><p>Despite the very severe economic and budgetary situation we have faced, the Government has clearly demonstrated its determination since coming into office to maintain and stabilise the budget for the aid programme to the maximum possible extent.  In the three years 2011 - 2013, a total of over &euro;1.9 billion was provided for ODA.  For 2014, the Government has allocated almost &euro;600 million for ODA.  While this represents a slight reduction, of about 3%, on the 2013 allocation, it remains a hugely significant allocation of public funds for Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, at a time of economic difficulty.</p><p>In their letter, the students rightly point out the damaging impact of child labour, including on a child&rsquo;s ability to attend school and to develop in a safe and healthy environment.  Our new development policy affirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to improving access to education and to protecting the rights of children.  We recognise from our own history that improving access to quality education is central to efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive economic growth.  In 2012, for instance, we provided a total of &euro;33.9 million from the Irish Aid budget for education programmes in developing countries.</p><p>As a result of determined international efforts to invest in education, there are now more children in school than ever before. Between 1999 and 2009, the global school-aged population increased by 25% and primary school enrolment increased by 59%.  However progress has not been uniform across the world and <font color="#212100">recent statistics show that progress has slowed down since 2005. As of 2011, as many as 57 million children, 54% of them girls, remain out of school. Lower enrolment and primary school completion rates for girls remain a particular problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is the geographic focus for our aid programme.</font></p><p>Ireland also strongly supports international efforts to eliminate child labour.  Irish Aid provides specific support to the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s <i>Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour</i>.  This year and next year, our funding is supporting efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labour from tobacco growing in Malawi and Zambia, quarrying in India, artisanal fishing in Ghana and stone-breaking in Benin.</p></reply>

These services have made a concrete difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas, reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their statutory entitlements locally.</p><p>  Since 2003, the Emigrant Support Programme has provided more than &euro;114 million in grants to Irish community and voluntary organisations, of which &euro;86 million has been provided to more than 200 organisations in Britain. This funding has been directed primarily at front-line welfare services, working to support those made vulnerable by health, age or dislocation. In 2013 approximately 80% of the grants paid in Britain were made to organisations providing welfare and information services to the Irish community.  The organisations funded provide a range of services from informal community networking groups for seniors, to outreach services and advice in accessing entitlements.  Our support continues to evolve.  For example, in 2013, a grant was made to Console, the suicide prevention and bereavement service, to assist with the start-up costs of their new operation in Britain.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-08a.99.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050800031#WRC00600"><p>As you are aware the One-Parent Family Tax Credit has been replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Credit from 1 January 2014.   However, the credit is more targeted in that it is, in the first instance, only available to the principal carer of the child.  Given the difficult fiscal environment, it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child is unsustainable.  The new credit is designed to be an activation measure, which was the original intention behind the One Parent Family Tax Credit, which it replaced.  It is designed to be an in-work benefit to support a principal carer to take up, or remain in, employment.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, a principal carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.  A secondary carer may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year.  I have no plans to review this reform at this early stage although, as is part of normal practice in the preparation of the annual Budget, my officials monitor all tax measures to ensure that they are operating effectively.</p><p>  In addition to the credit, the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) is a payment provided by the Department of Social Protection to both men and women aged under 66 years who are bringing up a child or children without the support of a partner. In order to get this payment, a person must first meet certain qualifying conditions and satisfy a means test.  The number of OFP recipients stood at 77,714 in March, 2014.  A key decision for Budget 2014 was to maintain the basic rates of social welfare income support payments.  As such, no change was made to the OFP payment. The maximum personal rate for the parent remains at &euro;188 per week   with a further &euro;29.80 per week for each additional qualified child.</p><p>  In recent years, reforms have been made to the OFP scheme. These reforms are aimed at tackling the high rate of poverty and social exclusion experienced by one-parent families which can be caused by long-term welfare dependency.  They aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape poverty and social exclusion, participate in education and training, enter the workforce and, ultimately, attain financial independence and social well-being for both themselves and their families. They also aim to bring Ireland's support for lone parents in line with international provisions where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, introduced several changes to the OFP scheme including the phased reduction of the age limit of the youngest child at which a recipient's payment ceases to seven years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  Transitional arrangements will apply during the period between 2013 and 2015 depending on the date that a recipient first claimed the OFP payment.  By 2015, the maximum age limit of the youngest child will be seven years for all OFP recipients.  Special provisions exist for lone parents who are in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) or who are recently bereaved.</p><p>  As a result of the reforms to the OFP scheme, once an OFP recipient's youngest child reaches the relevant maximum age limit threshold, they will no longer be entitled to the OFP payment. Should they still have an income support need, they will be required to apply for another social welfare income support payment. Persons who are working 19 hours or more per week may be entitled to apply for the tax-free Family Income Supplement (FIS) or to have their existing FIS claim re-rated as appropriate. Others may be eligible for the Carer's Allowance.</p><p>  Former OFP recipients can also apply for either the Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) or the Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) transitional arrangement. They will then have access to the Department's full range of work activation supports to enable them to improve their employability and to subsequently find work.  If a person is unable to meet either the JA or FIS scheme rules, and if they continue to have an income support need after their entitlement to the OFP payment ceases, they may have recourse to the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme.</p></reply>

As I said in that answer, the temporary exemption from the payment of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is provided for under section 135 of the Finance Act 1992, as amended. Subject to certain conditions, restrictions and limitations, a qualifying vehicle, i.e. a vehicle which is validly registered outside the State, may be granted temporary exemption from the requirement to be registered in the State.  On receipt and examination of the required documentation to process an application, an officer will make a determination on the application.</p><p>  In the event of an application being refused, the officer outlines the grounds for refusal and the appeal process is clearly explained to the applicant.  Sections 145 and 146 of the Finance Act 2001 govern the appeal procedure and allow the applicant two months to lodge an appeal.  The vehicle registration tax due on the vehicle must be paid before the appeal can be processed.  When an application for exemption from VRT is lodged, it is the responsibility of the applicant to furnish the required proofs to meet the necessary criteria.  If all of these proofs are not available at that time, the applicant will be given a period within which to produce these proofs.  However, if after the expiry of this period, these proofs are still not forthcoming, the application will be refused.  The applicant has the opportunity to lodge an appeal and present the proofs, should they become available, to the Appeals Officer.</p><p>  Where the appeal process has not been availed of, there is no provision for Revenue to continue processing an application.  Where an applicant is deemed ineligible for any of the legal exemptions from VRT in respect of vehicles registered in another Member State, or, if a person brings in a non-State registered vehicle into the State which is not exempt from payment of VRT, that person is legally obliged to register the vehicle and pay the appropriate tax in order to use it in this jurisdiction.  Failure to do so within the prescribed period (30 days) constitutes an offence under Section 139 of the Finance Act 1992.</p></reply>

While this situation has occurred in previous years, the Irish banks were able to process payments between themselves as the domestic payment system continued to operate. However, the full implementation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) has resulted in this option no longer being available. Notwithstanding this, most of the Irish banks made every effort to process payments for their customers on 1 May and the level of disruption was not as significant as might have been expected.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland worked with the Irish Payments Services Organisation (IPSO) and the banks to minimise any inconvenience to customers. Business representative bodies and businesses that make large numbers of direct debit and credit transfer payments were contacted and advised that where possible they should bring payments forward to 30 April; in addition, a notice advising consumers about the closure and its consequences was inserted in all of the major national newspapers on Friday 25 April and also placed on the Central Bank of Ireland and IPSO websites.</p><p>  The full implementation of SEPA means that at least for the time being this situation will recur on 1 May in each year that the Irish May bank holiday does not coincide with the European one.  The Central Bank of Ireland, IPSO and the Irish banks will make every effort to minimise disruption to customers via an ongoing communications programme aimed at raising awareness of the 1 May payments issue.</p></reply>

The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake.  The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>Setanta Insurance Company Limited (&quot;Setanta&quot;) is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). While its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland as the Central Bank has no role in that regard, the firm is supervised by the Central Bank for conduct of business rules, i.e. consumer protection obligations.  The Central Bank is in contact with the MFSA in relation to Setanta Insurance Company Limited, the impact on policyholders and the provision for relevant and appropriate information, particularly in relation to claims.</p><p>On 16 April 2014, Setanta determined that the company was insolvent. This means that Setanta does not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors. Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA following a meeting of the creditors which took place on the 30 April 2014 where a liquidator, Mr. Paul Mercieca, was appointed.  Officials from my Department together with officials from the Central Bank met with the Liquidator and his representatives in Ireland on 7 May 2014. At that meeting, the Liquidator confirmed that Setanta will not be in a position to pay the full amount of claims. It is also unlikely that a pro-rata portion of premiums will be refunded upon completion of the Setanta liquidation.</p><p>While the position on each policy is for the Liquidator to decide in due course, all claims must be treated in the same way by the Liquidator.  The Liquidator has advised that he intends to place notices in national newspapers shortly and to send letters to policyholders advising them of cancellation of policies next week.  It would be prudent for Setanta policyholders to make alternative motor insurance arrangements, as soon as possible, as advised by the Central Bank.</p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is a non-profit-making organisation which was established by Agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland. The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. If, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).

If the scheme beneficiary and trustees agree, Revenue will raise no objection to the payment of once off pensions. This may only take place where the total of all funds available for pension benefits, following payment of any lump sum benefit, is less than &euro;20,000 (increased from &euro;15,000 in 2007). The quantum of retirement benefits from all sources must be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the &euro;20,000 limit.</p><p>  The level at which pensions can be commuted under the &quot;Trivial Pensions&quot; rule is kept under review by Revenue. However, as one of the principal objectives of any pensions policy is to provide a regular income to persons during the course of their retirement it would not be advisable to allow the commutation of large numbers of pensions under the &quot;Trivial Pensions&quot; rule. For this reason, there are no plans at the moment to increase the level from &euro;20,000.</p></reply>

Withdrawals from the remainder of the fund will be taxed at the individual's marginal income tax rate regardless of whether it is drawn in full or piecemeal over time. Under current UK flexible access rules, an individual can only avail of full flexibility draw down, subject to marginal rate income tax, where they have guaranteed income in retirement of at least &pound;12,000 per annum (down from &pound;20,000 heretofore) and while full cash withdrawal of a defined contribution pension pot is permitted, it  incurs a tax charge of 55%. The UK Government is currently undertaking a public consultation on the proposals, the results of which will help determine how best the policy intention can be delivered on next year.</p><p>  As regards arrangements in the State, flexible options at retirement are available in respect of all benefits from DC retirement benefit schemes and other DC pension savings. Choices which are available to individuals (after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum) include the option to purchase an annuity with the remaining funds, to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to marginal rate income tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. </p><p>  Under the regime the options to invest in an ARF or  receive the balance of the pension fund in cash) are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&quot;specified income&quot;) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement. The specified income requirement is &euro;12,700.</p><p>  Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &quot;set aside&quot; amount must be invested. The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income &quot;safety net&quot; throughout the latter period of an individual's retirement where their pension income is below the specified income limit. The maximum &quot;set aside&quot; amount is &euro;63,500 of the pension fund or the remainder of the pension fund after taking the tax-free lump sum, if this is less than &euro;63,500.</p><p>  The capital in an AMRF is not available to an individual until he or she reaches 75 years though any income generated by the fund can be drawn down subject to tax. The capital in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase a pension annuity and the AMRF can be changed to an ARF with access to the capital sum (subject to taxation) before the age of 75 where the specified income test is met before that age.In terms of increased flexibility, the primary difference between the proposed UK regime and the regime that operates here is the fact that from April 2015, the UK proposes to dispense with their guaranteed income test. In that regard, I have no plans to change the equivalent rule here or the alternative AMRF set aside rule.</p></reply>

Revenue has also confirmed that as a result of a comprehensive data matching exercise across both registers, it has matched 1.27 million properties for which the HHC was paid, to the LPT Register of 1.69 million properties (other than Local Authority/Social Housing). The Deputy will appreciate that it is absolutely essential from a fairness perspective to the vast majority of house owners who paid both the HHC and LPT that Revenue follows through on those who have not.</p><p>  To ensure that all liable persons meet their HHC obligations, Revenue announced a compliance campaign on 18 February 2014, but in doing so provided a six week window to 31 March to allow people get both their HHC and LPT affairs in order without incurring any additional charges or penalties. This window and the consequences of continued non-compliance were very extensively advertised on both national and local media outlets and I am happy to say that very many people availed of the opportunity to bring their property tax affairs up to date.</p><p>  Revenue began writing to the remaining property owners who opted not to bring their affairs up to date during the six week window on 17 April. The notification clearly warned of the consequences of continued non-compliance but also outlined the steps that needed to be taken in regard to both payment options and updating the records where no payment was due, thereby preventing any collection/enforcement activity.</p><p>  In regard to the issue date of the letters, Revenue has confirmed to me that it did in fact process the letters on the specified date/s (17 April) but due to the Easter period An Post was not in a position to make delivery for up to five days in some instances. For that reason Revenue will take a reasonable approach in regard to debt recovery providing the property owner makes contact and commits to dealing with any outstanding issues within an agreed period of time. For the Deputy's information, since the compliance letters started to issue on 17 April Revenue has received almost 40,000 items of correspondence and is handling between 8,000 and 12,000 phone calls each day. Revenue has indicated to me that it will not commence debt recovery activity until the backlog is cleared and while it will not make any further direct contact with non-compliant property owners in advance of debt recovery activity, it will clearly signal its intention in this regard through its regular media updates.   </p><p>  The Deputy should be aware that to assist compliance, Revenue has developed a new online service that facilitates property owners to make payment, or to indicate that they have already paid or are exempt. This service, which can be accessed by using the Property ID and PIN codes provided on the notification that issued, is available 24 hours a day and is both intuitive and easy to navigate. Revenue has also made its Helpline at 1890 200 255 available on an 8am to 8pm basis for any person who wants to make direct contact rather than using the online system.  </p><p>  In summary, I am satisfied that Revenue has been very facilitating in its approach to collecting the outstanding arrears of HHC by providing the initial six week window, by developing additional IT support and by providing extended Helpline opening hours. I would recommend that the Deputy outline these provisions to any constituent who may still have outstanding issues in respect of either HHC or LPT and advise that early contact with Revenue will in most instances prevent any stressful and expensive enforcement sanctions.</p></reply>

The first &euro;1,270 of chargeable gains in any tax year is exempt from capital gains tax. Where the gains exceed that amount, capital gains tax will only be charged on the amount in excess of &euro;1,270. The current rate of capital gains tax is 33%.  </p><p>  Where land has been owned by a person for a minimum period of 10 years and has been used by that person for farming throughout that period, retirement relief applies to a transfer of such land  by a person, who is aged 55 or over, to his or her child.  Where the person is aged between 55 and 65 years, there is no restriction on the amount of relief that is available. However, relief is capped at &euro;3m where the person who transfers land to his or her child is aged 66 or over and the transfer occurs on or after 1 January 2014. If the land on which relief is granted is disposed of by the child within 6 years of the date of the transfer, the relief granted will be clawed back by way of an assessment on the child. </p><p>Stamp Duty</p><p>  The transfer of agricultural land normally attracts a charge to stamp duty at the rate of 2% on the market value of the land transferred. A reduced rate of 1% applies in the case of a transfer, on or before 31 December 2014, where the transferee is a child of the transferor. </p><p>  There is an exemption from stamp duty where the transferee is a young trained farmer. To qualify as a young trained farmer, the transferee must be under 35 years at the date of the transfer and must also be the holder of specified educational qualifications as set out in Section 81AA and Schedule 2, 2A and 2B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. This exemption applies where the transfer is executed on or before 31 December 2015. However, as the farmer's child mentioned by you does not have a &quot;green certificate&quot;, it would appear that he would not be the holder of the necessary qualifications and therefore the transfer would not qualify for the young trained farmer exemption.</p><p>Capital Acquisitions Tax</p><p>  The transfer of land by a person to his or her child also constitutes a gift to the child for Capital Acquisitions Tax purposes (CAT). CAT is the overall name for both Gift Tax and Inheritance Tax.  For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (the disponer), and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold-known as the &quot;Group Threshold&quot;.  The Group Threshold applying to a gift or inheritance, received by a child from his or her parents, is the Group A threshold and, for 2014, this is &euro;225,000. Any other gifts/inheritances that might have been received by the child from his or her parents since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account when applying the threshold for the purposes of calculating the gift/inheritance tax.</p><p>  CAT is charged on the excess value over &euro;225,000 received by a child at the rate of 33%.  Where a gift or inheritance consists of agricultural property, the market value of the agricultural property gifted may be reduced by 90% for CAT purposes provided certain conditions are met.  The main conditions are that the beneficiary of the gift/inheritance must qualify as a &quot;farmer&quot; in order for agricultural relief to apply to the lands being transferred.  A &quot;farmer&quot; is defined in the legislation as an individual whose gross property consists of at least 80% agricultural property, as defined, after receiving the gift or inheritance.  Also, the beneficiary of the gift/inheritance must not sell the lands for a period of six years after receiving the gift/inheritance. </p><p>  Where CGT and CAT arise on the transfer of lands, the CGT paid can be credited against the CAT liability arising provided the lands are not disposed of within 2 years of the acquisition. This ensures that the transfer of the lands is not subject to double taxation.</p></reply>

As part of the building process, Revenue received the Household Charge (HHC) Register from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and cross-referenced both registers to identify a database of properties where the HHC is still outstanding. </p><p>  For the Deputy's information, the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 states that where a 'granny flat' has a separate entrance/sanitary facility/electricity supply, then it is liable for the HHC, as it is deemed a separate property; but if facilities are shared and there is only one entrance to the property it is deemed part of the main property and is not liable for a separate charge. </p><p>   In the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the HHC record for the 'Granny Flat' indicates a liability to the charge.

Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary)  Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15/05 (Primary) . </p><p>  This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs. These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time.</p><p>The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in these standard SNA contracts of employment. In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. </p><p>  Accordingly, DES Circular 71/2011 was issued on 15 December 2011 which outlined that these 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. I should point out that this divisor was agreed with both of the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.</p><p>  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>  &quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS Hours Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.</p><p>This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;</p><p>An LRC process has now commenced in respect of the application of this provision of the Haddington Road Agreement.</p></reply>

The policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.</p><p>  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country has been a key educational priority in recent years. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. </p><p>  Details of the special classes for children with autism, including details of special classes for children with autism in the Kerry area are available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.  I have arranged for the matter raised by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

My Department provides funding to all recognised primary schools by way of per capita grants. Enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The Ancillary Services grant is paid to all recognised schools unless the school has been provided with secretarial and caretaking assistance under the 1978/1979 schemes. Under these schemes the secretary and/or caretaker are paid directly through the Department payroll.  The funding arrangements made by my Department for post primary schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system. At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.  My Department provides funding to Community and Comprehensive schools on a budget basis that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school etc. </p><p>  With regard to the ETB sector financial allocations are made to ETBs as part of a block grant. ETBs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and each is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need.  My Department provides funding to voluntary secondary schools by way of per capita grants.  Fee charging schools do not receive any capitation or related grants from my Department.</p><p>Information on the various per capita grant rates going back to 2004, as requested by the Deputy, is not readily available. My officials are currently compiling this information and it will be forwarded to the Deputy in due course.</p></reply>

The database will allow the Department to more closely monitor and evaluate progress and outcomes of pupils at primary level, to validate school enrolment returns for grant payment and teacher allocation purposes and to follow up on pupils who do not make the transfer from primary to post primary level.  The system is currently in development.  A pilot is currently in operation, involving a small number of volunteer schools.  The main population of the database with existing pupil data will take place during the 2014/2015 academic year and the database is scheduled to come fully into operation in the 2015/2016 academic year.  Schools will access the database via the Esinet portal.  </p><p>  The database will hold individualised pupil level data on all primary school pupils including their PPSN, First Name, Surname, Name as per Birth Certificate, Mother's Maiden Name, Address, Date of Birth, Gender, Nationality, whether one of the pupil's mother tongues is English or Irish, whether the pupil is in receipt of an Exemption from Irish and if so the reason for same, whether the pupil is in receipt of Learning Support and if so the type of learning support, whether the pupil is in a Mainstream or Special Class.  If the pupil is in a Special Class the database will also record the type of Special Need associated with the class and with the pupil.  The database will also record the class grouping and standard the pupil is enrolled in.  The database will also contain, on an optional basis, information on the pupil's religion and on their ethnic or cultural background.  Note that parental/guardian consent will be required for these optional data items.  The database will also hold information on DES centrally held school level data such as School Name, Address and Telephone Number.

The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published on 24 January, 2014.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. </p><p>  The Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school.  The most recent statistics are for the 2012/13 school year.  The national average class size is 24.7 pupils.  However, with over 20,800 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level.  The Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p><p>  The staffing arrangements include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in Circular 0007/2014.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

This included allowing the three applicant groups of institutes of technology who had submitted a formal expression of interest to merge and to apply to become a technological university to proceed to the second stage of the four stage process, published in February 2012.  The three groups of applicant institutes included a group comprising the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Institute of Technology Tallaght and the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown.  The three institutes are now developing a detailed plan towards merger and it is expected that this will be submitted to the Higher Education Authority shortly.  </p><p>  The plan must address how the institutes propose to meet the criteria for a technological university and the process requirements and related timelines.  The establishment of a technological university requires the consolidation of two or more institutions.  Accordingly, the plan must be based on a legally binding memorandum of understanding between a consortium of existing institutions describing their consolidation into a new single institution, which has been approved by the Governing Body of each institution.</p><p>  Following receipt of the submitted plan, the Authority will appoint a panel of experts to assess the plan.  The Expert Panel will have regard to:</p><p>- the capacity of the proposed consortium to achieve the objectives of consolidation in terms of academic rationale, scale, the degree of integration through alliances and membership of clusters and the extent to which workplace practices have been developed to bring them into line with those of a modern university, and</p><p>- the existing position of the proposed consortium in relation to each of the technological university criteria and its capacity, based on its developmental trajectory, to meet these criteria within a reasonable timeframe.  </p><p>  A decision will be provided by the HEA to the applicant within six months of receipt of the plan.  If, in the opinion of this Expert Panel, the proposal is likely to meet the criteria for designation as a technological university within the proposed timeframe the applicant institutes can proceed towards full legal consolidation followed by a formal application to become a technological university.</p></reply>

Funding for the SIF from the Department ended in 2012. One of the key objectives of the SIF was 'to prepare for the expansion and development of postgraduate education', and a range of projects were funded to support capacity-building within and across institutions, and particularly to support the development and delivery of structured doctoral programmes. Projects included the IUA Fourth-Level Ireland Network and the Institutes of Technology Research Alliance. These graduate education projects were complemented by a range of other projects which enhanced the research base of the sector, including the IUA's 'Open Access to Research Output', through which the RIAN portal was established; and the IOTI's Research Support and Coordination Office, established to support the growth of research capacity in the institute of technology sector. A listing of all of the SIF projects outcomes and outputs is attached has been forwarded to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This will include new targets to increase participation by under-represented groups. The Third Level Access Measure provides support for disadvantaged students through two sub-priorities: the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. The overall value of the measure for the 2013/14 academic year is &euro;16.2 million. The Student Assistance Fund, allocated to 31 higher education institutions, provides targeted financial support for students who face financial difficulties during the course of their studies. The value of the Fund was &euro;8.35 million for 2013-14. The Fund for Students with Disabilities provides resources to both further and higher education institutions to enable accommodations and supports to be put in place for students with disabilities on full-time courses. &euro;10.2 million has been allocated for this purpose to-date in 2013-14 academic year.</p><p>  In addition, the access programmes of the higher education institutions are supported by a core access grant which forms part of the annual, recurrent grant allocation by the HEA to each of those institutions. Over &euro;25 million in core access funding has been allocated to 26 higher education institutions as part of the 2014 allocation. The purpose of this allocation is to support development and implementation of an access plan by each higher education institution as required under legislation. This includes work by the access office of each institution with schools, further education colleges and the wider community. Funding also supports the provision of post-entry supports and services for students with disabilities, first-time mature students and school-leavers from target socio-economic groups.</p></reply>

Reports of progress by higher education institutions to the Higher Education Authority, indicate that the majority of post-primary, DEIS schools are linked with the access programme of at least one third level institution in their area. Some of the longer established access programmes have links with at least thirty second level schools (both DEIS and non-DEIS) in their respective regions, as well as with a number of feeder primary schools. Since 2009 the seven universities and nine other third level colleges have collaborated on the development of a Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) scheme as part of the annual CAO process. The objective of this scheme is to target the allocation of reserved places in higher education and other supports for school-leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds. One of the criteria for the award of a place through this scheme is whether a student has attended a DEIS school.</p><p>  As part of the national strategy for higher education and the ongoing process of reform in the wider education landscape, it is planned that closer collaboration between higher education institutions and other education partners &ndash; both nationally and at regional level - will further strengthen opportunities for young people attending DEIS schools to access higher education.</p></reply>

The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.

The procurement of public contracts should be conducted in an open, objective and transparent manner and the principles of all EU and national public procurement rules should be adhered to.</p><p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.  A tender which might be regarded as abnormally low or below cost may not be rejected without investigation and consideration of the relevant elements that gave rise to a particularly low bid.  Such elements might include an innovative technical solution or exceptionally favourable conditions available to the tenderer.  The tenderer must be given the opportunity to explain the basis of the tender.  Under Article 55 of 2004/18/EC, the EU Directive governing public procurement, contracting authorities are obliged to consider the constituent elements of a tender before it may reject a tender on the basis that it is abnormally low.  Having carried out an investigation on the constituent elements of the tender, should it consider the tender to be abnormally low, the contracting authority may reject the tender but is not obliged to.</p><p>  In relation to the awarding of specific contracts these are matters for the relevant contracting authorities concerned.</p></reply>

In 2013, the net reduction was &euro;210 million. This reduction was enabled, in part, by the implementation of various measures under the Haddington Road Agreement which helped to ensure that spending remained in line with profile and resulted in Ireland delivering on our fiscal target for 2013.</p><p>  I am satisfied that approximately &euro;300 million in savings, arising from the implementation of various measures under the Agreement, was incorporated into the estimates for 2013, comprising of approximately &euro;250 million in Exchequer pay savings and a further &euro;46 million in savings arising from pensions and a number of other non-Exchequer sources (e.g. Local Authorities, Central Bank etc).</p><p>  While the savings allocated under the Agreement in 2013 helped to bring the Public Service Pay Bill to a more sustainable level, it also allowed the scope to recruit additional staff to frontline services, particularly in the Education Sector and the Health Sector. This is a reform dividend that will help sustain the Public Service Reform agenda by re-investing some of the efficiency savings we are delivering into improved services.</p><p>  In addition, it is worth noting that a further &euro;465 million in savings arising from the implementation of measures under the Agreement was incorporated into the budgetary arithmetic for 2014, bringing the total amount of savings allocated under the Agreement to &euro;762 million, or over 75% of the targeted savings under the Agreement.  The focus is now on the comprehensive delivery of the Agreement and that task falls to Public Service Management and each Department's Accounting Officer who are responsible for the delivery the required level of savings to ensure that their respective pay bill targets are met.</p></reply>

In particular, the Court recommended that  the parties should enter into central negotiations with a view to reaching a generally applicable agreement on measures by which loss arising from the elimination of pensionable allowances can be ameliorated.  My Department is currently working on proposals to put to the staff side. </p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement provides that there will be full co-operation with the Allowances review, taking account of the recommendations contained in Labour Court Recommendation 20448, and the outcome of the review will therefore be advanced in each sector during the lifetime of the Agreement.  The Agreement also provides for changes to certain allowances in the sectors. The Haddington Road Oversight Group is keeping the matter under general review.  </p><p>  In cases where no agreement can be reached, the time-bound mechanism for dispute resolution through existing industrial relations systems, the Labour Court or Conciliation and Arbitration Schemes, or through the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement), is available.  Because many allowances have been discontinued for new appointees to posts, the precise figures on the numbers of allowances discontinued will depend on rates of staff turnover across the public service, however the estimated savings arising have been built into the pay allocations for 2014. </p></reply>

The building is in fragile condition currently and needs significant stabilisation works. </p><p>  Work on the project commenced over a year ago when scaffolding was erected.   This facilitated the collection of samples so as to devise a suitable historic mortar and the identification of appropriate sources of stone.  The access facilitated by the scaffolding also enabled the survey and planning work necessary for such a significant and intricate project and was necessary in order to complete the required application for Ministerial Consent required under the National Monuments Acts for such works. Detailed assessment had to be carried out with recording on each floor as part of the documentation for Consent. </p><p>  Works to the Castle are now underway but currently most of the activity is internal, on the ground floor.  This is a substantial  undertaking and it is anticipated that the project will take up to a further five years to properly complete.  When complete, the works will facilitate much improved and safe access for the public.</p><p>  I accept the points raised in relation to signage at and on the approach to the site.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) will erect a sign at the start of the fenced public access path alerting potential visitors that the castle cannot be accessed as works are ongoing but that they can if they wish go as far as the end of the access path.  The OPW will also move the information plaque to just outside the site so that it can be read whilst looking at the Castle should any visitors choose to go and view the Castle from a short distance.</p></reply>

One such measure is that IDA Ireland will commence building new advanced manufacturing facilities in Waterford and Athlone and office space in Letterkenny. </p><p>  I announced in April that IDA Ireland had agreed contracts for the delivery of two advanced technology buildings in Athlone and Waterford, which will be suitable for future IDA client investment from a number of potential sectors. The Athlone building will be located in the IDA Garrycastle Business &amp;amp; Technology Park, on the Dublin Road.  The development will consist of an advanced technology building of approximately 2,674 m2, part two storey and part double height single storey, with associated infrastructure.  The Waterford building will be constructed at the IDA Business &amp;amp; Technology Park, Butlerstown, Cork Road, Waterford.  This development will comprise of an advanced technology building of approximately 2,348 m2, part two storey and part double height single storey, with associated infrastructure. </p><p>  Both buildings have been designed to high standards.  The building layout has taken account of the requirement of potential end users for flexibility by creating front of house open plan offices areas with the potential for subdivision. The rear open plan production area offers flexibility for large scale open plan of again the potential to subdivide or introduce cellular spaces.  The proposed buildings will be of high quality environmental design which will achieve the globally recognised U.S.G.B.C. LEED &quot;Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design&quot; silver standard.  Employment across the two projects will be in the region of 160 to 180 over the construction cycle. </p><p>  In the case the office units in Letterkenny, I am informed by IDA Ireland that a  developer led solution is in progress at the IDA Business &amp;amp;Technology Park in Letterkenny to deliver a 23,000 sq. ft. office building by the end of 2014.  In the current economic climate coupled with the limited availability of funding for all capital projects, investment must be targeted to potential investment wins and associated job creation opportunities.  IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to assess the requirements in other regional locations on an ongoing basis. </p></reply>

This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the Union.  Regional aid is also provided under schemes for tourism grants, marine tourism, urban and rural renewal and other tax-based development schemes.

The current average times taken to process invalidity pension appeals decided by summary decision is 31.2 weeks and 42.2 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.  The current average time taken to process supplementary allowance appeals decided by summary decision is 15.2 weeks and 21.3 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.  </p><p>  The workload of the appeals office has increased dramatically in recent years.  Up to 2009 the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum, whereas in 2012 the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  This has placed considerable pressure on the office.</p><p>  Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process to manage this increased workload, reduce backlogs and improve appeals processing times for appellants, while, at the same time, recognising the need to ensure that quality and fairness are not compromised.  An additional 15 Appeals Officers have been assigned to the office over the past three years, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number to 41. In addition, a new operating model has been introduced in the appeals office.  </p><p>  These measures have achieved significant improvements. The number of appeals cases processed in 2013 increased by 18%, to over 38,400. The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This overall improvement has continued in 2013 with the processing time reducing to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision, and in 2014 with the processing time reducing to 29.7 weeks for an oral hearing and 22.6 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer and further investigation or medical examination, if deemed necessary.  </p><p>  In addition to improvements in processing times, the measures which have been introduced in the appeals office have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in recent years from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress also continues to be made in reducing the number of appeals on hands from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 13,374 at 6 May 2014.</p></reply>

These decisions were taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives:</p><p>- There are currently 5.3 people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately 2.1 to 1 by 2060;</p><p>- The over 65 year old population is also projected to increase from 11% of the total population in 2010 to 15% in 2020 and to 24% in 2060;</p><p>- Life expectancy is increasing.  In the mid-1990s, life expectancy for males was 73 and for females, 78.5.  For those aged 65 today life expectancy for males is 82 years for men and 85 for women, by 2030 this will have risen to 84.1 and 87.4 respectively.</p><p>These changes are currently taking place.  There are approximately 17,000 additional pensioners coming into receipt of State pension each year:</p><p>- In 2013, the overall Departmental expenditure figure was &euro;20.2 billion and expenditure on pensions accounted for 32% of this;</p><p>- In the absence of reform, it is estimated that State expenditure on pensions (including public sector occupational pensions) will increase from approximately 7.5% of GDP in 2010 to 11.7 % in 2060.    </p><p>The increases in State pension age were provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011.  This provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  In January 2014, State pension age was standardised at age 66 with the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. </p><p>With regard to the abolition of State pension transition in 2014, it should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.  State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the majority of people who went into receipt of the State pension (transition) did not come from work, as most were already on other social welfare schemes. In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, just 12.5 per cent came from work.  Over 50 per cent came from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers, indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age. </p><p>Finally social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.   All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66. </p><p>The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. Persons who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  In addition, with effect from 1 January 2014, fully unemployed job seekers aged 62 or over have been placed on yearly signing and given the option of transferring to EFT payments.  They are not subject to mandatory activation measures but may avail of employment supports which will continue to be available to them and they will not be subject to mandatory activation related sanctions. </p><p>The OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System in 2013, which I commissioned, stated that: &ldquo;<i>Ireland is ahead of the curve in setting higher retirement ages for the future and many hard decisions have already been made compared to most other OECD countries in this respect&rdquo;. </i>The OECD also stated that the scheduled increases in pension age are enough to compensate for the projected increases in life expectancy.  I have no plans to introduce any further changes to the qualifying age for the State pension age.</p></reply>

The arrangements in respect of qualified adults are identical to those which apply if the claimant is in employment or has an equivalent type pension. The purpose of the disregards and tapering arrangements where employment is a factor is to incentivise both claimants and qualified adults, as appropriate, to remain in, enter or re-enter the workforce. </p><p>  There are no plans to change the current arrangements at this stage.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities. Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to selected local authorities during the year. </p><p>Detail of the total spending on rent supplement per annum from 2007 to 2014 is set out in the table.

The most recent meeting of the Working Group took place on 29 April last.  As has been previously outlined to the House, the commemorative programme is a comprehensive exploration of our history that keeps pace with the centenary timeline.  I believe that this approach will provide an important contextual setting for the commemorations of the 1916 period.</p><p>  Most initiatives to date this year related to key events leading towards the Easter Rising, to be complemented by commemorations in August and beyond marking the outbreak of World War 1.  Events in 2014 in relation to 1916 activities adhering to this historic timeline include the following: 21 March: conference on the Curragh Mutiny organised by Trinity College at the Curragh.  2 April: commemoration of the founding of Cumann na mBan led by the President, with a wreath-laying ceremony in co-operation with the Defence Forces; a visit to prominent women's grave, -including that of Nurse Elizabeth O'Farrell, who accompanied Pearse at the surrender.  3 April: unveiling of plaque at Wynn's Hotel to mark the inaugural meeting of Cumann na mBan.  4-5 April: conference organised by the Women&rsquo;s History Association of Ireland at the National Museum in Collins Barracks.  Issue of special commemorative postage stamp.</p><p>  Options are being explored to partner with local communities and discussions are ongoing with the Department of Defence to mark the landing of arms at Howth and Kilcoole by the Irish Volunteers and the loss of life incident at Bachelor's Walk at end-July.  Later in the year, the passing and suspension of the third Home Rule Bill will be marked and subsequently the position of John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party on participation in the war will be addressed.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing: a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses.  For example: Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps.  Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016.  UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network.  Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps.  Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps.  ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure.  It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage.  The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks.  Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction.  There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements.  Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband.  The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.</p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years.  This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas.</p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  Currently I envisage that a total of 84 areas in County Galway, 79 areas in County Tipperary and 15 areas in County Wicklow will be included in the proposed fibre build-out.  The list is available on my Departments website .</p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive.  Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention.  A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised.  It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible.</p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years.  In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out a fibre-based broadband network in Counties Galway, Tipperary and Wicklow , which includes rolling out these services in 57 locations in Galway, 43 locations in Tipperary and 28 locations in Wicklow by July 2016.</p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas.  I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component.  In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.</p></reply>

The issuing of licences is administered by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI).  The applications are considered by the Board of IFI and decisions are made in advance of the start of the commercial fishing season which commences on 12 May each year.  Regulations are made annually, following statutory public consultation, for the management of the wild salmon and sea trout fishery, based on the management advice provided by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI).  IFI is supported in its management of stocks by a statutorily based Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon comprising scientists from IFI, an Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the <font color="#4C4C4C">Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) </font>other State bodies and third level institutions.</p><p>This independent scientific committee assesses and offers advice on the predicted stocks status in all 143 Irish salmon rivers each year against that rivers conservation limit using the most recent five years of available data from the catchment.  The conservation limit is the number of adult salmon required on each river to maintain a healthy population; the stock level that maximizes the long-term average surplus.  If a river stock is determined to have surplus fish that are over and above the conservation limit for that river, a total allowable catch is declared.

This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries under the 2010 Inland Fisheries Act.  The individual river management strategy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.</p><p>  IFI is supported in its management of salmon stocks by a statutorily based independent Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon (SSCS) comprising scientists from IFI, an Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions.  This independent scientific committee assesses and offers advice on the predicted stocks status in all 143 Irish salmon rivers each year against that rivers conservation limit using the most recent five years of available data from the catchment.  The conservation limit is the number of adult salmon required on each river to maintain a healthy population - the stock level that maximizes the long-term average surplus.</p><p>  Harvest fisheries (recreational or commercial) are only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus of fish over their conservation limit, based on the most recent five year data on upstream salmon runs in individual rivers.  In the case of the Newport system, SSCS advice is given separately for one sea winter and multi sea winter salmon stocks.  This policy, based on the conservation imperative, has been applied to the rivers referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses.  For example:</p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps.  Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016; </p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network.  Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps.  Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps;</p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure.  It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage.  The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks;</p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction.  There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements;</p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband; and</p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.</p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas.  On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.</p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  Currently I envisage that a total of 36 areas in County Monaghan, including the area of Lisnalong will be included in the proposed fibre build-out as well as the 59 locations listed for County Kerry. The list is available on my Departments website .</p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive.  Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention.  A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible.</p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component.  In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-08a.353.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050800040#WRM01100"><p>State owned Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC) sold the Whitegate refinery and Whiddy Island oil storage facilities to a private firm called Tosco Corporation in 2001.  A key element in the transaction was Tosco Corporation&rsquo;s undertaking to operate the two facilities (the Whitegate refinery and Bantry (Whiddy Island) storage terminal) for at least 15 years (until mid-2016) on a commercial basis.  This condition also applies to any subsequent purchasers of the assets during the period.  The ownership of the facilities has changed a number of times since 2001 without impacting operations.</p><p>  Phillips 66, the current owners of the refinery, confirmed in mid-2013 that they had commenced a process to market their Irish business with the process expected to last for several months, during which time the company would operate on a business as usual basis.  The company has recently confirmed that they are no longer marketing the Whitegate refinery but are continuing to market the Whiddy Island oil storage facilities. This entirely commercial transaction is underway and neither I nor officials at my Department are involved in it.  Phillips 66 have further indicated that they are continuing to run the refinery on a business as usual basis and are proceeding with a planned maintenance regime at the Whitegate refinery in 2014.</p><p>  In terms of the Whitegate refinery itself, the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) has a contract with the refinery that in the event of an oil supply disruption situation and when requested by NORA, they will provide NORA with a proportion (currently representing less than 10%) of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil reserves in the form of refined product over a set period.  In July 2013, I published a study commissioned by my Department on the strategic case for oil refining requirements on the island of Ireland.  The study found that the existing oil import facilities on the island of Ireland taken as a whole offer a robust infrastructure that could provide comfortable alternatives in the event of a serious disruption at any of the six principal oil ports.  They could supply the total oil demand, regardless of any future decisions on the operation of Whitegate as either a refinery or terminal.  The development of the Irish motorway network has been significant in improving oil security of supply in recent years, facilitating the transport of oil from key ports throughout the island of Ireland.  Work with counterparts in Northern Ireland is ongoing with a view to enhancing contingency planning on the island.</p><p>  I outlined last July that the Government&rsquo;s primary conclusion on the strategic case for oil refining is that the presence of an operational refinery on the island of Ireland provides flexibility, enhancing the options available to the State in the event of an oil supply disruption, by providing an alternative source of product thus mitigating a complete reliance on product imports.  Despite energy efficiency advances and an increase in the penetration of renewable energy, Ireland is expected to remain dependent on oil into the medium term, particularly for transport.  As such, the continued operation of the Whitegate refinery on a commercial basis is highly desirable from an oil and energy security of supply perspective.  The study concludes and the Government also acknowledges and recognises that an operating refinery also adds value to the Irish economy and provides significant employment.</p><p>  I further outlined that in light of our primary conclusion, the Government had agreed that my Department should liaise with the Irish oil industry and appropriate public bodies to determine available policy options that might facilitate the commercial future of refining in Ireland.  The consideration of available policy options to support the commercial future of refining in Ireland is ongoing.  Given that the state sold the refinery to private owners in 2001 and in the context of the state assets divestment programme which is underway, the Government has not considered purchasing the refinery.  The Government&rsquo;s approach should be considered in light of wider international concerns about the European refining sector.</p><p>  EU Member States have recently seen several refinery closures or conversion to terminals and the International Energy Agency has generally expressed concerns about the reduction in European refinery capacity and the consequent potential security of supply implications in the longer term.  The challenges facing the refining sector in Europe have been acknowledged by the European Commission which is currently in the process of carrying out an EU Fitness Check on the refining sector.  So-called &ldquo;Fitness checks&quot; are comprehensive policy evaluations assessing whether the regulatory framework for a policy sector is fit for purpose.  Their aim is to identify excessive regulatory burdens, overlaps, gaps, inconsistencies and/or obsolete measures which may have appeared over time, and to help to identify the cumulative impact of legislation.  Their findings will serve as a basis for drawing policy conclusions on the future of the relevant regulatory framework.

The overall aim of the CER&rsquo;s economic role is to protect the interests of energy customers, maintain security of supply, and to promote competition in the generation and supply of electricity and supply of natural gas.  The CER has an important related function in customer protection by resolving complaints that customers have with energy companies.</p><p>  The CER was initially established as the Commission for Electricity Regulation under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 and the functions and duties of the CER have been altered and expanded significantly by legislation transposing EU directives into Irish law and the introduction of new primary legislation.  SI 463/2011 gives further legal effect to consumer protection provisions of Directive 2009/72/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and Directive 2009/73/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas, by strengthening the powers of the Commission for Energy Regulation in regard to consumer protection and imposing specific obligations on electricity and gas distribution system operators and suppliers.</p><p>   The CER has set out guidelines for the protection of electricity and natural gas customers which require all suppliers to put in place codes of practice and customer charters guaranteeing a minimum level of service to all customers, including prepayment customers. Suppliers use the guidelines to develop their own documents which they must publish and publicise to their customers.  All suppliers must meet the CER&rsquo;s guidelines for the protection of all customers.  Under the powers provided for in SI 463/2011, the CER offers a dispute resolution service for customers with an unresolved dispute with an energy undertaking.  Customers may avail of this service where a supplier has not met the service levels set out in their customer charter and codes of practice.  The CER has the power to investigate customers&rsquo; complaints and issue determinations for their resolution.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the CER has the necessary resources and legislative authority to regulate this market properly and protect consumers and my Department is in frequent contact with the CER to monitor developments.  I am aware of the potential difficulties for many customers and am anxious to ensure that all energy customers receive the utmost professional customer care from energy suppliers and have appropriate recourse to consumer protections, enforced by the CER.</p></reply>

No.132 of 2014.  The administration of licence allocation is managed by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) in accordance with the criteria set out in the S.I.  I am advised by IFI that there are a total of 14 public licences available in the Kerry District for the 2014 Season.  The 20 applications received by IFI were categorised and ranked following the methodology and criteria prescribed in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order.</p><p>  I understand that the 14 available licences were awarded to the highest ranked applicants in accordance with the established procedures and criteria.  The application from the person referred to by the Deputy was not ranked sufficiently under the criteria to enable a licence to issue to him on this occasion.  I have arranged for a copy S.I. No.132 of 2014, which sets out the award criteria, to be forwarded to the Deputy.  I would be happy to arrange a briefing with IFI for the Deputy on the licence award procedures and process.  I understand that the personal details of applicants may be subject to Data Protection legislation and it would not appear appropriate for me to provide that information.</p></reply>

In order for biofuel to be eligible for inclusion in the scheme it must meet certain sustainability criteria as set out in the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive.  That is, biofuels must not be made from feedstocks sourced from certain categories of land, and must achieve certain greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  Although the Biofuel Obligation Scheme does not apply to the disposal of fuels used for off-road vehicles, such as those used in the agriculture sector, there is no prohibition on the use of biofuels in such vehicles.  Where biofuel is used in off-road vehicles it is categorised as gas oil and must comply with the regulations on fuel standards as set out in Statutory Instrument 155 of 2011 which were introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to transpose the Fuel Quality Directive.</p><p>The Regulations also permit the sale of petrol with up to 10% bioethanol and diesel with up to 7% biodiesel and require that fuel suppliers must provide information on biofuel content to reduce the risk of fuelling vehicles with incompatible fuel.  Further information on the Directive and Regulations can be found at.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance. The provision for retrospective declarations had become a means of evasion of motor tax. </p><p>  The new arrangements have been fully in force since 1 October 2013. These only allow for a future declaration which must be made in the month before tax falls due, i.e. the declaration must be made prospectively. The declaration of non-use can be made at any time during that month, either via the local motor tax office or online, and is free of charge. </p><p>  I consider the full calendar month currently allowed for the making of a declaration to be sufficient to enable motorists to make a prospective declaration that their vehicle will be off the road. I have no plans to amend the legislation to allow a declaration to be made on the first working day of a month, as this would provide for the re-introduction of retrospective declarations.</p></reply>

Nor is there any requirement in international law requiring domestic legislation to combat incitement to hatred against a person or persons on grounds of disability. EU Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law requires the Member States to criminalise incitement to hatred, hatred being defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent, or national or ethnic origin.</p><p>  Where other criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage, or public order offences are committed with a hatred motive, they are prosecuted as generic offences through the wider criminal law.  Judges are required to take aggravating factors, such as targeting a victim because he or she is disabled, into account at sentencing.  Also, the discriminatory grounds in equality legislation to combat discrimination in employment and the provision of services include disability.  If an evidence-based case is made to add disability to the discriminatory grounds in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, this will, of course, be examined.</p></reply>

The statutory provisions restricting the sale of alcohol on Good Friday, which have historical origins, will be examined in that context.</p><p>  Unfortunately, due to the complex nature of the proposed Bill, I am not in a position to state when it will be published.

This Department in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) have all collaborated on this case.  Unfortunately, there are no provisions in Irish law, which provide a basis for Ireland to pursue a prosecution against the alleged perpetrator.While the country with primary jurisdiction in this case is Lebanon, the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are also in contact with the US authorities.  The US authorities have recently confirmed that the alleged perpetrator resides in the United States.  The United States Department of Homeland Security is currently investigating the matter to see if there is sufficient evidence which may enable them to take a case against the alleged perpetrator.  As you will appreciate, such investigations can take a considerable amount of time to complete. The Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue to engage with the US authorities, as appropriate, and as the case remains ongoing.</p><p>  I can assure you that this matter has not been forgotten and that we are continuing with our very best efforts in this case.  It is indeed 34 years since this tragic event happened and despite the passage of time the Department will continue to actively pursue the matter so that the families concerned can get the justice they deserve.</p></reply>

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.</p><p>  The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers.  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p><p>   The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis.  Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:-</p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.</p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.  Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks.  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, including the specifics of PDFORRA&rsquo;s claim, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p></reply>

Rates of reimbursement, fixed in accordance with UN categories of equipment and personnel, are agreed in a Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the UN for each mission.

The amount currently owing to the Department of Defence by the United Nations is approximately &euro;8 million.  This amount relates to the current UNIFIL (&euro;1.3m) and UNDOF (&euro;0.3m) missions.  It also includes &euro;6.4 million in respect of repatriation costs of equipment from the MINURCAT mission in Chad.  The amount owing in relation to the MINURCAT mission is currently the subject of a review by the United Nations.   </p><p>  A Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the United Nations is also being finalised in respect of Defence Forces participation in the UNDOF mission.  While troop costs for the UNDOF mission have been reimbursed by the United Nations, equipment costs will be reimbursed following signature of the Memorandum of Understanding.  Ireland is not entitled to any reimbursement in respect of Defence Forces participation in EU-led missions as all troop contributors to such missions are responsible for their own costs.</p></reply>

I am further advised that the Defence Forces did have some indicative figures of numbers of personnel intending to retire by 31 August 2014, the original date under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act which allows staff who retire before this date to have their pension calculated on the pay rate in force prior to 1st July 2013.  However, on foot of a Government decision to extend the grace period to 30th June 2015, a number of members of the Defence Forces have indicated their intention to re-consider their proposed retirement dates.  Taking this into account and given that personnel can retire from the Defence Forces for a variety of other reasons, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to accurately forecast retirements for the remainder of 2014.  Taking the departures for the first three months of the year into account, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 31 March 2014, the latest date for which details are available, stood at 9,133. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Government has agreed a stabilised strength of 9,500 for the Permanent Defence Force.  In the context of current strength numbers being below the agreed stabilised strength, a new General Service recruitment campaign for both the Permanent and the Reserve Defence Force was announced in March this year.  The Defence Forces plan to induct up to 400 personnel to the Permanent Defence Force (both Army and Navy) and up to 500 personnel to the Reserve Defence Force (both Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve) in 2014.  Additionally arrangements are currently underway to hold a Cadetship Competition for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service in 2014. It is planned to award a total of 40 cadetships from this competition comprising of twenty (20) Army, nine (9) Air Corps and eleven (11) Naval Service. </p><p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 192 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) with 135 Defence Forces personnel.  With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.  Due to Ireland&rsquo;s own current level of commitment in overseas peacekeeping operations, notably to the United Nations Disengagement Force in Syria and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, we are not in a position to make any significant commitment to other missions at this time. The current contribution of some 410 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security. Details of the Naval Service and Air Corps personnel who have served overseas since 01 July 2013 are listed on the table.  The Department does not deploy Naval Service or Air Corps assets overseas. </p><p><b><i>AS OF 04 MAY 2014</i></b><table><tr><th>1.</th><th>UN MISSIONS</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ</td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNIFIL 42nd Infantry Group</td><td><div>176</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNIFIL Sector West HQ</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation ) Israel &amp;amp; Syria</td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo)</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast)</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNDOF (United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) Golan Heights Syria</td><td><div>135</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UNMAS (United Nations Mine Action Service ) South Sudan</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>354</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>EUFOR (EU led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>--</td><td>EUTM Mali (EU led Training Mission)</td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ</td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>ISAF (International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan)</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS</td><td><div>388</div></td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>OSCE Mission in Belgrade &ndash; Serbia</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group Vienna</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING OSCE</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>EU MILITARY STAFF</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Brussels</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>NORDIC BATTLE GROUP 2015</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>FHQ Sweden</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Military Adviser Irish delegation to OSCE, Vienna</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Military Representative to EU (Brussels)</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Liaison Office of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels)</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS</td><td><div>410</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>NAVAL SERVICE AND AIR CORPS PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS SINCE 01 JULY 2013</i></b><table><tr><th>-</th><th><div>ENLISTED PERSONNEL</div></th><th><div>OFFICERS</div></th><th><div>TOTAL</div></th></tr><tr><td>Naval Service</td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Air Corps</td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>17</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>22</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for the Department of Defence and is a matter that is kept under constant review.  However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in.</p><p>  The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.  A particular focus is maintained in ensuring that modern and effective equipment, including communications equipment, is available for overseas peace support operations.  In this regard, the personal equipment, which the individual soldier has at his/her disposal in Lebanon and on other overseas missions is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.</p></reply>

While progress has been made by the Military Authorities in addressing gaps between male and female participation in the Defence Forces, it is recognised that more work needs to be done to meet the gender target for recruitment of females of 20% which was set by the Military Authorities in 2007.  In this context, as part of the recently announced recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts are being made to increase the number of female applicants as part of a wider campaign aimed at improving gender and ethnic representation and diversity in the Defence Forces.  In the case of female participation, these efforts include school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and use of social media. </p><p>As at 31 March 2014, the latest date for which figures are available there were 555 women out of a total strength of 9,133 serving in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  This represents 6% of the overall strength of the Defence Forces. The following table gives the number of women serving in each branch of the Permanent Defence Force for the last 8 years i.e. from 2006 to 2013.

The Defence Forces conducts training and education under three broad categories namely skills training, career training and education and collective training. Skills training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that its personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills to permit the development of organisational capabilities. Career training provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels from Section Commander to Brigade Commander. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together. This moulds Sub-Units, Units and Formations into integrated and coherent combat forces. This provides the Defence Forces with the capabilities required to fulfil its roles and missions, both at home and overseas.</p><p>  External education at University and Institute level, both home and abroad, fulfils Defence Forces requirements by providing education and expertise, which cannot be delivered within the organisation and which ensures that Defence Forces personnel attain the required level of academic and professional qualifications. </p><p>  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice. Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multi lateral-training and assessment. This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces re-skilling and training methods and standards within an international military context.  I am advised that Defence Forces personnel continue to have the requisite modern and effective training methods and equipment and technology for both their training and day-to-day roles.</p></reply>

This change to the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions was one of a number introduced in 2012, designed to make the Scheme more focused and, in doing so, contribute the necessary savings to the Scheme budget. This reduction in the overall Scheme budget was necessitated by the national budgetary position. However, rather than applying an across-the-board rate cut, a more targeted approach was adopted, designed to minimise the impact on those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme. It will be recalled that a robust appeals mechanism was put in place to allow those who wished the opportunity to challenge their ineligibility, following the changes. Some 12,000 farmers availed of this process.</p></reply>

The legislation requires all keepers of equines to identify horses in accordance with the legislation. The process of identification includes completion of a marking sheet by a private veterinary practitioner and since 1 July 2009, in accordance with the Commission Regulation, the insertion of a transponder, which creates a link between the animal and the passport.

The Act provides the legal basis for the notification of transfer of ownership of horses and legislation is currently being prepared to provide for this. Also new regulations on the registration of horse premises, which I introduced in 2012, require an owner/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept to register the premises with my Department. My Department will, in conjunction with the local authorities and An Garda Siochana, continue to adopt a pro-active approach in relation to horse welfare and will remove at-risk animals and, where appropriate, institute prosecution relating to any maltreatment of these animals.</p><p>  My Department has been operating an Animal Welfare Helpline for some time with a view to enabling persons who are concerned about the welfare of horses or indeed any animal to contact my Department.

Levels of discards in the EU vary depending on the size and nature of the fishery.</p><p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards for many years and I was delighted to launch an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas in 2011, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet targeting whitefish on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  This was the first publication of its kind and placed Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards and assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package.</p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish was a major component of the negotiations for the reform of Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which were concluded under the Irish Presidency in 2013.  To this end I was pleased that agreement was finally reached whereby a practical and phased discards policy or landing obligation will be introduced, beginning in 2015.  The phasing in period means that fishermen will have time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of non target species where there are particular problems with the relevant by-catch (such as that the stock is overfished and needs to be allowed to rebuild). </p><p>  In that context, I have established a national Discards Implementation Group, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Noel Cawley, to advise on the issues arising in the effective implementation of the new policy and to recommend practical solutions and arrangements that take into account the situation of the Irish industry.  The primary aim of the group is ensure that the Irish fishing industry are fully prepared for, and engaged in, the implementation of the discards ban.</p><p>  The work of Dr. Cawley&rsquo;s group also contributes directly to the work of the regional group of Member States (Ireland, Belgium, France, UK, Netherlands and Spain) who have the primary responsibility in the development of specific &lsquo;Discard Plans&rsquo; for fisheries in north western waters.  The first of these, for pelagic fisheries, is expected to be presented to the Commission for adoption later this year and will come into effect on 1 January 2015.</p></reply>

The FVO also audit the controls of the importing countries for equivalent standards before that country is authorised to import meat into the EU.  Such products are required to comply with EU labelling legislation.</p><p>  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), under the aegis the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the enforcement of food safety and labelling requirements in Ireland.  It carries out this remit through service contracts with my Department and other agencies including the Health Service Executive (HSE), Local Authority Veterinary Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  Inspections to ensure compliance with traceability and labelling legislation are carried out by inspection services provided by these agencies under the aforementioned contracts.</p><p>  The enforcement of food law, including food labelling is a matter for the control authorities in each Member State (MS).  Data on the extent of compliance or detected non compliance is currently not gathered centrally, but may be reflected in the separate annual reports of each MS in respect of its multi annual national control plan.  The European Commission, through the annual audit programme of its Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), has oversight of the work of the control authorities, which does include checks on enforcement of labelling rules by the Member States.  A Member State is obliged to take corrective actions in the event of any deficiencies being noted by the FVO.</p><p>  EU rules on food labelling apply equally to foods produced in the EU or imported from third countries.  Products of animal origin from third countries enter the EU via the official Border Inspection Posts and can therefore be subject to checks at that stage.  Products of non animal origin are subject to spot checks during import and distribution.  Finally, and without prejudice to the framework of public controls described above, primary responsibility to ensure compliance with food labelling rules throughout the food chain rests with the food business operator - such as the producer or importer.</p></reply>

However when making the transition to the new Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, it is no longer possible to justify the significant differences in the level of support per hectare granted to farmers based on the use of such historical references.</p><p>  The original Commission proposal which involved a move to a &lsquo;flat-rate&rsquo; payment by 2019 would have had a sudden and significant negative impact on agricultural production in particular for those with a high dependency on their farm related income.  As an alternative my Department proposed the &lsquo;Irish Convergence Model&rsquo; which while initially retaining the link with current payments under the Single Payment Scheme, gradually moves all farmers towards, but does not arrive at, a national average value by 2019.  The purpose of this model is to achieve a phased redistribution of payments between those who currently hold high value entitlements and those who hold low value entitlements and consequently the link with the historical production reference will be gradually reduced over the five years of the new scheme. </p><p>  The new scheme introduces a fair and equitable re-distribution of funds between farmers while avoiding the negative impact of a sudden and significant change in income support for individual farmers.  An additional safety net is added for those with low value entitlements whereby by 2019 they are guaranteed that they will reach at least 60% of the national average entitlement value.</p><p>  My Department has used stocking density as one measure of agricultural productivity.  While stocking density does not represent all the elements of agricultural productivity, it is a tangible and precise measurement of activity where data from my Department is readily available.  Previous analysis by my Department has found that, using average results per payment category, farmers on payment rates per hectare above the national average have roughly double the stocking density of those below the average.  My Department is satisfied therefore that for most farmers there is a fundamental correlation between stocking density and the value of payment entitlements held under the current Single Payment Scheme. </p><p>  However, our analysis also shows that the stocking density of farms on the very highest payment rates (e.g. over &euro;500 per hectare) is not significantly higher than the stocking density of farms just above the national average.  As there is no direct link between high value entitlements and high production, My Department has decided to apply a cap on the payment per hectare under the new scheme whereby by 2019 no farmer will receive a payment per hectare, consisting of his Basic Payment and Greening payment, of over &euro;700.</p><p>  The outcome is a reasonable and balanced compromise between the need for a fair redistribution of funds while ensuring that such distribution continues to reflect the realities of agricultural production in Ireland.  The decision to apply the greening payment as a percentage of each individual farmer&rsquo;s payment is based on the same principles.</p></reply>

My aim is to build long-term trading relationships into the future in these sectors, particularly in new and emerging markets and since taking office I have led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East.  In relation to the individual sectors, the latest position is as is as follows:</p><p><b>Dairy markets</b></p><p>Market analysis predicts that medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  More than 85% of Irish dairy production is exported and Ireland has full market access to over eighty countries worldwide, with one third of the value of dairy exports going outside the EU.  I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere.</p><p>Ireland strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1 April 2015 on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  I expect the abolition of quotas to facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020.  For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment and equip it to respond to the market opportunities arising.</p><p>Of course, the industry itself has a responsibility to focus its efforts on market and product development.  Supported by Government, the Irish dairy sector has succeeded in positioning itself as a major international player and we have seen industry announcements in relation to the development of supply arrangements between Irish companies and multinational players in third countries as well as the development of value-added products which can maximise the value of our dairy output.  In that context, last week the Chinese authorities announced results of an audit of Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector, which means that Irish plants have been found to fully meet the standards of China&rsquo;s new food safety laws.  This approval will allow the Irish dairy sector to build on their formidable reputation in international markets, and in the increasingly important Chinese market, and to further capitalise on Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for green, efficient, high quality dairy production. </p><p><b>Meat Markets</b></p><p>There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.  My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues.  These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to import from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran which allow the import of Irish beef; with Singapore, South Africa, UAE, Canada and the Russian Federation-Customs Union for the import of Irish sheepmeat and with Australia and Serbia for the import of Irish pork.  To date in 2014, the Lebanon has agreed to re-open its market to Irish beef, sheepmeat and cooked meats.  A certificate has also been agreed with Hong Kong allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat and agreement has been reached with Namibia on a certificate for the export of beef, sheepmeat and goatmeat.</p><p>In November 2013, the US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union.  This was one of my priorities the previous year when I visited the US, where I pushed the matter strongly with the US Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsack and in meetings with Senators.  My Department is working with the meat industry to advance the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of the trade at the earliest possible date.</p><p>In December 2013, a delegation from my Department visited China for discussions with authorities there on the lifting of the beef BSE ban which prohibits imports from any EU country.  While there are a number of stages to go before Ireland secures access for beef to China, I am hopeful that these can be progressed further in 2014.</p><p>Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets.  This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.  Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.</p></reply>

To ensure price transparency, results for Members States are published on the DG Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development website.  The published weekly data includes market prices for carcasses and live animals as well as information on production and herd inventories.  This publicly accessible information allows stakeholders to monitor the evolution of the market situation in each Member State. </p><p>  The inherent nature of cattle farming with its long production cycle makes it difficult to control and predict beef supplies and prices.  In Ireland, these inherent characteristics are further complicated by the influence of export trading conditions and underline the need for the timely communication of market intelligence between the various actors operating in the supply chain.  The recent roundtable discussions with representatives of all stakeholders in the beef sector, that I convened and chaired before Easter, were designed to facilitate such a process.  It is my intention to hold these roundtable discussions on a quarterly basis.</p><p>  The primary determinant of prices in any market is the relationship between supply and demand.  Price variations in different EU beef markets reflect prevailing internal and external factors.  With regard to the price differential between Irish and UK cattle, a number of factors have been identified to explain why Irish-born cattle command lower prices than their British equivalents.  These include a British consumer preference for indigenous product as well as additional transport and processing costs in supplying that market.  Ireland&rsquo;s trade with Britain accounts for 53% of our beef export volumes, worth &euro;1.1 billion and, at around 250,000 tonnes in 2013, is equivalent to 750,000 cattle with a high level of penetration in the multiple retail sector.</p><p>  Supply and demand developments on the key export markets for Irish beef in 2014 will determine the cattle prices for Irish beef farmers.  In the short run, the outlook for finished cattle supplies and for beef supply are determined by the current inventories of animals aged 1-2 years.  Inventories of these animals in Ireland and the EU are higher than in 2012, indicating that the EU and Irish beef production will be higher in 2014 that in 2013.  Given the short-term increase in beef production, the outlook for EU finished cattle prices depends on the prospects for demand in the EU.  All other things being equal, an increase in supply would be associated with some decline in prices.  The extent to which this outcome is avoided in 2014 will depend on whether European demand for beef grows and the magnitude of that growth relative to forecast growth in supply.</p><p>  Beef prices are a barometer of supply and demand but what is critical to farmers is the margin at which they produce their animals.  For example, better grass utilisation and better breeding decisions by producers will improve the output of their production systems.  The ongoing work of Teagasc and ICBF is critical to addressing the challenges of improving efficiency, environmental sustainability and technology adoption in the suckler beef sector.  In this regard, significant Government investment, which is worth up to &euro;40m to farmers in 2014, is designed to improve market returns for primary production.  Targeted supports such as, the Beef Genomic Schemes and the Beef Data Programme, Knowledge Transfer initiatives, together with the measures announced under the new RPD will enable beef producers to improve the physical and financial performance of their enterprises.</p></reply>

The agreement is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters, utilising best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas in the future.</p><p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of the MSY Principle (Maximum Sustainable Yield) will lead to increased fish stocks and ultimately to higher quotas for Irish fishermen over time.  It will end the practice of widespread overfishing and mean a more viable fishing industry for the longer term.  Setting annual fishing quotas respecting best scientific advice will inevitably lead to increased fish stocks and more sustainable fishing patterns over time.</p><p>  A practical and phased discards policy is being introduced where in early years of implementation, TACs and quotas will be set to take account of current levels of discards, should see quotas increase over time.  This means that fishermen will have time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of non target species where there are particular problems with the relevant by-catch (such as that the stock is overfished and needs to be allowed to rebuild).</p><p>  Technical measures are being introduced to avoid and minimise catches of juvenile fish and the reforms contain a commitment to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in the biologically sensitive area off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box).  The commitment to develop and strengthen biologically sensitive areas, with spawning grounds and high populations of juvenile fish will also protect the livelihoods of coastal communities by ensuring that fish are allowed to grow to maturity, are more plentiful and fished in a environmentally responsible manner. </p><p>  The new policy puts fishermen at the core of developing new policies to protect juvenile fish and vulnerable fish species with a completely new regionalised decision making approach.  This is a big change as up to now decision making was fully centralised in Brussels.  The new CFP has moved away from the old system of an EU wide development and application of the rules, a one size fits all approach.  I am confident that the new CFP will support a sustainable and profitable fishing industry into the future.</p></reply>

In 2013, the value of dairy exports increased by 15 per cent to some &euro;3 billion for the first time.  The Central Statistics Office provides a detailed annual breakdown of the volume and value of trade to all destination countries.  </p><p>Notwithstanding this successful trade performance, I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere.  I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  Market analysis predicts that medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.</p><p>Ireland strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1 April 2015 on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  I expect the abolition of quotas to facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020.  For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment and equip it to respond to the market opportunities arising.</p><p>A key element of this market strategy is to optimise the already positive green image of Ireland in order to create a point of differentiation for Irish dairy products on international markets.  In this context, I was delighted to launch the <i>Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme</i>last December.  The scheme has the potential to really boost the competitive advantage of Irish dairy products on the global market.  Ireland&rsquo;s strong sustainability positioning is fundamental to this.  At processing level, Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green Programme is providing a vehicle for industry to commit itself to sustainability targets by reducing energy inputs, minimising overall carbon footprint and mitigating the impact on the environment.  This pro-active approach to environmental sustainability has a strong resonance with procurement strategists in the many multi-national food companies who are interested in using Ireland as a source of high quality food ingredients and processed products. </p><p>Of course the industry itself has a responsibility to focus its efforts on market and product development.  Supported by Government, the Irish dairy sector has succeeded in positioning itself as a major international player, and we have seen industry announcements in relation to the development of supply arrangements between Irish companies and multi-national players in third countries, and the development of value added products which can maximise the value of our dairy output.  </p><p>In that context, last week the Chinese authorities announced results of an audit of Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector, which means that Irish plants have been found to fully meet the standards of China&rsquo;s new food safety laws.  This approval will allow the Irish dairy sector to build on their formidable reputation in international markets, and in the increasingly important Chinese market, and to further capitalise on Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for green, efficient, high quality dairy production. </p></reply>

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production. In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector. Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.  </p><p>  The 2013 harvest is estimated in the region of 2.35 million tonnes, well above the long-term average production of 2 million tonnes and is 22% higher than the 2012 harvest. Despite the dismal start to the growing season, the good summer resulted in excellent yields in wheat and barley. Yields for winter and spring wheat are increased to 9.3 tonnes and 8.0 tonnes per hectare, respectively, while winter and spring barley are estimated at a record 9.5 tonnes and 7.1 tonnes per hectare, respectively. </p><p>  Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies. Grain prices for 2013 have been very volatile from the peak of 2012 as world harvest estimates for cereals, and especially maize in the USA, are showing an increased level of output over previous years. Volatility in prices is likely to become a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future and grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies. </p><p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. </p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 outlined a number of challenges facing the cereal sector in the coming years including price volatility, climatic and disease issues, high input prices, small and fragmented holdings and the cost of rented land. However, the report also pointed to positive projections for cereal prices as markets are relatively well-balanced and world cereal prices are projected to be higher than in the last decade. It is known that global grain production is struggling to meet the increasing demand for food, feed and industrial uses. In addition to a rising global population creating a bigger demand for cereals, an increasing demand for meat is disproportionately increasing grain demand even further. It is predicted that global demand for cereals will reach 3 billion tonnes by 2025 compared with 2.3 billion tonnes currently. </p><p>  The primary growth in requirement for Irish cereals in the years ahead is likely to be for animal feed, given the targets for increased livestock output proposed in Food Harvest 2020. However, considerable potential also exists in grains for the drink industry such as malting barley and recent significant investments by the large brewing and distilling companies here in Ireland are proof of such potential. Further, it is envisaged that there will be increased demand for Irish oats milled for human food for the home and export markets and in this context, the success of the Agribusiness sector in securing, long-term contracts with US-based Foods companies to supply milled Irish oats to a premium Irish oatmeal brand in the US market, is particularly welcome.</p></reply>

An Appropriate Assessment has to be carried out before any aquaculture licensing determination may be made in respect of aquaculture applications for sites in the bay.</p><p>  The European Court of Justice declared in case C418/04 that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43 (Habitats Directive) in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive.  In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.  This process includes the following steps:</p><p>  - a detailed data collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries</p><p>  - detailed analysis of raw data collected</p><p>  - setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site</p><p>  - carrying out Appropriate Assessments of each licence application/fishery plan against the detailed Conservation Objectives set, and</p><p>  - determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors.</p><p>  The carrying out of detailed surveys of marine habitats and species has been completed.

In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The revised working arrangements provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement are a pivotal element in this regard. Subject to approval by senior managers, arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement.  In addition, the HSE continues to fill a significant number of development posts in line with service priorities identified by Government. </p><p>  The HSE has been asked to examine the specific queries raised by the Deputy concerning Letterkenny General Hospital and to reply to him as soon as possible.</p></reply>

However, my Department is actively involved in plans for a Public Access Defibrillation Programme.</p><p>  The Second Stage of the Public Access to Defibrillators Bill was passed in the Seanad in June 2013.  The Bill sets out the requirement to provide defibrillators in a range of settings and for events which have a regular attendance in excess of 100 persons per day.  It was agreed that there are a number of questions that need to be considered when designing a public defibrillation programme for Ireland.  Government approval was therefore granted for the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of a Public Access Defibrillator Programme for Ireland.  This HTA will inform my subsequent decisions on the design and implementation of a national programme of public access defibrillation and the necessary legislation which my Department will draft.</p><p>  The first meeting of the Expert Advisory Group on Public Access Defibrillation took place on 13 March in the HIQA offices.  It was agreed that the second meeting of the Advisory Group would take place in June 2014, with the third meeting and Final Draft Report stage being undertaken in August 2014.  In mid-September, 2014 it is envisaged that a Public Consultation will begin, ending on or about 17 October.  It is expected that the Final Report will be ready for publication by mid-November, 2014.</p></reply>

On 26 November 2013, Government approved the appointment of retired Circuit Court Judge Yvonne Murphy to assist in setting out a possible course of action in relation to women who have undergone symphysiotomies. Judge Murphy commenced her review of issues relating to Symphysiotomy in December and has submitted her report to me in mid-March. </p><p>I am closely examining the report and its recommendations.  I will bring a Memorandum to Government in the coming weeks, so that a decision can be taken as early as possible regarding next steps.

The key concerns are that footpaths are provided for the safety of pedestrians and to segregate vulnerable road users from passing or parking traffic on the roadway; that footpaths are not constructed to the same specifications as roads and are not built to bear the weight of vehicles; and that pavement parking, if allowed in some areas, could become a matter of habit for many people and difficult to restrict to the areas where it is legally permitted.</p><p>  I accept that there are also arguments which can be put on the opposite side, particularly in the case of very narrow streets where on-street parking would block traffic flow.  I am, however, willing to consider this issue further. The matter would need to be examined in some detail in consultation with key stakeholders and interested parties before any decision could be made with regard to the possibility of a pilot scheme.  I propose to engage with the  National Transport Authority which is the appropriate body to conduct such an examination.</p></reply>

I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply in relation to their proposals to address statutory and any other public consultation requirements in relation to the study.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>
