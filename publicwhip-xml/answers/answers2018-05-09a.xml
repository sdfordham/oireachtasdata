Waterways Ireland public jetties are provided in both Belturbet and Kilconny and the navigation channel is provided with navigation markers and signage as and where required. The upper limit of the managed navigation on the River Erne is currently just below Erne Bridge between Belturbet and Kilconny. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by Waterways Ireland  that a number of studies have been undertaken since the late 1980&rsquo;s to examine the feasibility of extending the navigation upstream from Belturbet to Lough Oughter. The results of these studies have not been taken forward due to budgetary constraints, extent of assessments required, anticipated impacts on the designated habitat, constraints on works due to environmental legislation, and the remit of Waterways Ireland.</p>  <p>  While there are no plans currently for a navigation extension scheme, Waterways Ireland have advised me that there may be potential in the waters of the Lough Oughter area being promoted as a distinct Blueway as Blueways Ireland (National Trails Office, Canoeing Ireland and other state bodies) is currently considering the establishment of Blueways beyond the Waterways Ireland network of inland waterways. </p>  <p>  To this end Waterways Ireland has met with the Chief Executive of Cavan County Council, Council officials and elected representatives concerning Blueways developed successfully on the Waterways Ireland network and to advise on possible ways forward. </p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland is happy to support Cavan County Council with advice should it decide to develop a Blueway on the River Erne from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra.</p></reply>

These schemes are administered via the local authorities.</p><p>The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is a scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures (i.e. structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures). The Scheme  is designed to leverage private capital for investment in a significant number of labour-intensive, small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craftspeople and tradespersons in the repair of the historic built environment. &euro;2m has been provided for the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2018. 370 projects have been approved for funding, including five projects in County Louth with aggregate grant aid of  &euro;50,000.</p><p>The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  &euro;1,324,000 has been provided for the Structures at Risk Fund 2018. 76 projects across the country have been approved for funding, including four projects in County Louth aggregating &euro;120,000 in grant aid.</p><p>Details of all projects funded under both schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and all local authority websites. While the closing date for the 2018 schemes has now passed, my Department remains in contact with local authorities throughout the year to ensure the best use of funding, including by reallocating unused funding where, for example, projects do not go ahead. </p><p>My Department has provided &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW<b></b>in 2018 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership. My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service also works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  Grant schemes for 2018 are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p><p>In terms of funding for future years,<i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027</i>represents a major capital investment scheme of close to &euro;1.3 billion in funding over the next 10 years. In addition to many other significant initiatives, this plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the National Symphony Orchestra has been located in the National Concert Hall since it opened in 1981 and it provides the backbone to the Hall's orchestral music programme. Therefore, there is no change in venue required for any organisational change.</p>  <p>  I have also recently announced a major &euro;78m plan to redevelop the National Concert Hall as part of the Government's capital investment plan for Culture, Language and Heritage. This includes provision of a larger hall and proper rehearsal facilities for the National Symphony Orchestra.  There is now an opportunity for the National Symphony Orchestra to play an even stronger role in the cultural life of the national as part of these wider developments. </p>  <p>  Officials in our Departments have been asked to advance the recommendations of the report as a matter of priority. This will require intense engagement between both our Departments and RT&Eacute;, and with the National Concert Hall. The concerns of employees of the orchestras will be to the forefront of considerations and there will need to be significant engagement with them in this regard. </p>  <p>  I expect to bring an early report to Government to chart a way forward including the steps which will be needed to address the recommendations.</p></reply>

The original closing date for receipt of submissions was 31st January 2018 and this was subsequently extended to 28th February.</p>  <p>  The objective of this process was to give interested parties the opportunity to submit their views and ideas around how the events between 1918 and 1923 might be appropriately and respectfully remembered, in line with the principles expressed in the Second Statement of the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations.  I was very encouraged by the response - 73 submissions were made, with 20 of these coming from local authorities. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to be supported in its approach to remembering the significant historical events between 1918 and 1923 by the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations, chaired by Dr Maurice Manning and by the All Party Consultation Group on Commemorations once established. The Expert Advisory Group has considered all of the submissions received and is now formulating the guidance that it will provide to Government to inform the State's approach to the remembrance of significant historical events and themes over the remainder of the Decade. I expect this to be provided to me in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In relation to the 2018 Commemoration Programme which is already underway; this comprises four thematic strands commemorating the significant historical event which took place in 1918:</p>  <p>  - the death of John Redmond and the decline of the Irish Parliamentary Party</p>  <p>  - the end of World War 1</p>  <p>  - the introduction of voting rights for women and their right to stand in Parliamentary elections</p>  <p>  - the emergence and divergence of Irish identity in 1918.</p>  <p>  In planning events for the remainder of the decade I am of the view that local authorities will have a key role in supporting engagement and facilitation in local communities and in developing suitable commemorative initiatives at county level and in line with the principles expressed in Second Statement of the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations.</p></reply>

This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built and natural heritage across the country.</p><p>Investment will include targeted supports for our built heritage such as the <i>Built Heritage Investment Scheme</i>and the <i>Historic Structures Fund</i>which help the owners and custodians of our heritage buildings to protect our valuable built heritage and ensure that vital traditional building skills are not lost. A major investment programme in our National Parks is envisaged with significant investment in visitor facilities and a strong emphasis on conservation and protection of biodiversity. The investment will also enable us to make our archaeological heritage more open to everyone, through better conservation, improved facilities and access.</p><p><i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage</i>will also support significant investment in recreational facilities including trails networks. The plan provides &euro;60 million over 10 years for biodiversity. It is envisaged that this will be spent on maintaining and restoring important habitats such as peatlands. The funding will directly support employment in the heritage, conservation and archaeological sectors. By safeguarding and preserving our heritage sites, we will also promote tourism and sustainable regional development. </p><p>More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code. These will be designed and delivered with a strong emphasis on conservation and allow us to protect and preserve our most fragile environments and, investing in our culture, language and heritage, provide a well-being benefit for all.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s archaeological heritage is of international significance.  I am the owner or guardian of almost 1000 national monuments in State care right across the country ranging from prehistoric burial monuments, to medieval fortifications and religious sites. Our national monument portfolio also includes more modern structures such as the eighteenth-century terrace at 14-17 Moore Street.  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are guardians. </p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants and supports for the protection and preservation of our heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  Grant schemes for 2018 are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p></reply>

The Public Spending Code provides that such reviews should be undertaken once sufficient time has elapsed to allow the project to be properly evaluated with sufficient evidence of the flow of benefits/costs from it. It should be noted that while the project was completed and commenced operation in 2018, it is necessary to wait until 2019 to conduct the review to ensure that there is adequate operational data available for the analysis.  This data is essential to assess the degree with which the project is meeting the objectives set for it at its outset.  In line with this requirements of the Code, it is my intention that the post project review will commence in quarter one of 2019 and will be delivered within a six month timeframe. </p>  <p>  The post project review will include the following terms of reference in respect of the review:</p>  <p>  - the development of a logic model for the project to guide the evaluation; </p>  <p>  - an examination of the rationale for the State&rsquo;s investment in the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema; </p>  <p>  - an assessment of the efficiency, effectiveness and impact of the State&rsquo;s investment in the cinema based on the objectives set out for the project at its outset; and</p>  <p>  - the identification of any learnings which may be used to improve the Department&rsquo;s appraisal, management or delivery of capital projects in future. </p>  <p>  The post project review will be conducted by the Department&rsquo;s Evaluation Unit which is made up of members of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES). It will be overseen by a Quality Assurance Group, as set out in the relevant IGEES guidance. It is intended that the members of the review team will come from within and outside the Department, including representatives with relevant expertise in the areas of evaluation, capital investment and culture.</p></reply>

Our 6 National Parks account for circa 65,000 hectares with another almost 20,000 hectares of nature reserves and other heritage sites. The existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess of 4 million visitors annually. </p><p>Given the resources available for capital investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am ever mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to increase the number of National Parks in the country. </p><p>However, as part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and improving our tourism and recreation product, we have been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. </p><p>In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. The purchase underpins the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.</p><p>In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This creates a State &ndash; Owned wilderness project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as  enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park. Thanks to the acquisition, we will be returning the area to a natural wilderness state.</p><p>My Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership last year with a view to growing tourism revenues in the rural areas where the parks are located and increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination. F&aacute;ilte Ireland invested capital funding of &euro;550,000 to kick-start the initiative.  This initial funding focussed on the five National Parks and five Nature Reserves situated on the Wild Atlantic Way in addition to Wicklow Mountains National Park. The funding facilitated the undertaking of feasibility, scoping and design of tourism and recreational projects, building on the strengths of each location, as well as further promoting track and trails within our National Parks and Nature Reserves for walkers and tourists.</p><p>One of the outputs from the partnership with F&aacute;ilte is &ldquo;<i>Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland</i>&rdquo;; an interpretative masterplan for the development of our National Parks and Reserves, and it is currently being finalised. This will prioritise and deliver significant investment at these important nature conservation, public amenity and tourism sites and underpins the objectives of Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage. The investment in our National Parks will create memorable and meaningful experiences of Ireland&rsquo;s landscapes, wildlife and culture. This will be done though sensitive design and the development of authentic experiences, providing better access to nature and an increased understanding of society&rsquo;s conservation responsibilities. </p><p>I recently launched &ldquo;Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage&rdquo;, a ten year plan setting out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage. A major investment programme in our National Parks is envisaged under this Plan with significant investment in visitor facilities and a strong emphasis on conservation and protection of biodiversity. Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage will support significant investment in recreational facilities including trails networks. These will be designed and delivered with a strong emphasis on conservation and allow us protect and preserve our most fragile environments and investing in our culture, language &amp;amp; heritage provide a well-being benefit for all. </p><p>Over the period of the plan, the following projects are planned: </p><p>- Improvement of visitor facilities at Connemara and Glenveagh National Parks;</p><p>- New walking and cycling trails at Ballycroy National Park;</p><p>- Investment in outdoor recreational facilities in Killarney National Park;</p><p>- Investment in interpretation at our Nature Reserves; and</p><p>- Enhancement of the visitor experience at Wicklow National Park.</p><p>- Strategic park enhancements</p><p>So while I have no plans to expand the Park network at present, my Department is actively ensuring the preservation, protection and presentation of the assets we already own.</p></reply>

The Bill has three main Parts, amending the Canals Act 1986, the Wildlife Acts and the Heritage Act 1995.</p><p>The principal purpose of the Bill is to implement the Report of the Critical Review of the Heritage Council approved by Government in 2013. </p><p>The Bill also amends the Canals Act 1986 to allow the making of bye-laws by Waterways Ireland for the regulation of boating and management of the canals. </p><p>The Bill also<i></i>provides for controlled burning of vegetation under strict regulation in the month of March on a pilot basis for a two year period, and for the managed cutting of roadside hedges, under strict regulation, in August, again for a two year pilot period. The Bill also clarifies the powers of authorised officers under the Wildlife Acts and harmonises the provisions of the Roads Act 1993 with the Wildlife Acts.</p><p><b>Burning of vegetation in the month of March </b></p><p>The provision in the Heritage Bill is not a blanket approval allowing the indiscriminate burning of vegetation in March.  The legislation provides for Regulations (on a two-year pilot basis) to allow burning in certain areas of the country, at specified periods in the month of March, for example where burning has been impossible earlier in the year due to adverse weather.</p><p><b>Cutting of hedges in August</b></p><p>The Regulations will require that any cutting of roadside hedges in August may only be of the current year's growth. Heavier cutting must still be done during the existing permitted period, i.e. between September and the end of February. There will be a public consultation process including consultation with relevant stakeholders in finalising these Regulations which are for a two-year pilot period.</p><p><b>Harmonising the Wildlife Act with the safety provisions in the Roads Act </b></p><p>Section 70(2) of the Roads Act obliges landowners to ensure that vegetation on their land is not a hazard to road safety.  A local authority may serve notices on landowners to deal with vegetation, for safety purposes, along public roads.  However, the Wildlife Acts state that such works may not be undertaken by landowners.</p><p>The conflict between these two pieces of legislation needs to be resolved and so the provision in the Heritage Bill is designed to harmonise both sets of legislation, clear up any confusion and remove conflict. </p><p><b>Regulation of boating on the Canals</b></p><p>The amendments to the Canals Act will allow Waterways Ireland to make bye&ndash;laws to regulate boating on the canals and to manage the use of the canals and will enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage these waterways for the benefit of all their users.</p><p>Our waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.  There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland.  There are over 500 boats on the Royal Canal, Grand Canal and Barrow Navigation and Waterways Ireland is seeking to encourage more visiting boats onto the waterways.  The existing bye law regime is not conducive to advancing this objective.  The proposed bye-laws are intended to encourage tourism and leisure craft users by supporting the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals and by enhancing Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s ability to manage, care for and maintain the canals and to help to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users. </p><p><b>The Heritage Council</b></p><p>In implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Critical Review of the Heritage Council approved by Government in 2013, this Bill will refocus the activities and functions of the Heritage Council, with a particular emphasis on engagement with communities and local authorities. The Bill also introduces the non-remuneration of Board members while continuing their entitlement to expenses incurred in discharge of their duties, reduces the size of the Board and removes the requirement for statutory Standing Committees on wildlife, archaeology, architectural heritage and inland waterways.  The Heritage Council retains the right to set up Committees as it sees fit.</p></reply>

Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government&rsquo;s international promotion strategy in tandem with other relevant Government Agencies. </p><p>This year,  Culture Ireland is presenting Culture Ireland GB18, a year-long programme of Irish arts in Great Britain that aims to showcase Irish artistic excellence in partnership with significant UK institutions, venues and festivals, to build on the unique (and in many respects shared) cultural relationship between the two countries and expand the reach of Irish culture to new audiences.</p><p>Great Britain is a key market for Ireland in terms of tourism, trade and investment promotion and the GB18 programme enables us to use our culture and heritage as a unique door-opener for Ireland and Irish business, and an effective means of articulating our values at a time of change in Ireland's wider relationship with Britain.</p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme led by my Department designed to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. Its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement. </p><p>Pillar I - 'Enabling the Creative Potential of Children' and Pillar II - 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community' of the Programme will see considerable investment this year in highlighting numerous events of a cultural and heritage nature across the country.  </p><p>For instance, a sum of &euro;3m (&euro;2m from my Department and &euro;1m from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government) has been allocated to all 31 local authorities (&euro;96,000 each approximately) to enable them support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county. In addition, each local authority has been allocated funding to host Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, a day of day of youthful creativity that will be held on the 23 June 2018 and which is specifically targeted at children and young people. Further details regarding Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g will be made available shortly.</p><p>The Creative Youth Plan, an initiative under Pillar I launched in December 2017 is underpinned by the principle that the arts and culture need to be at the centre of education. This will by its very nature increase interest in Irish culture and heritage among young people.  Work is currently underway in progressing the 18 actions contained within this plan which can be accessed at </p><p>Pillar V of the Creative Ireland Programme aims to enhance Ireland's global reputation as a creative and cultural nation and presents an unique opportunity to create a unified articulation of Ireland's values, capabilities and beliefs for the outside world with direct and indirect economic and social benefits. The <i></i>website articulating this vision was re-launched in March 2018 as a cross&ndash;sectoral initiative to showcase Ireland as a place to live, to visit, to invest, to study, and do business in<b>.</b></p><p>We will continue to work across Government in 2018, to further enhance Ireland's cultural and artistic reputation, particularly in the context of the recently launched ten-year plan &quot;Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027&quot; which sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage.

Because the monument is in my guardianship, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, it enjoys a high level of protection under the National Monuments Acts. Any ground disturbance or other works at or in proximity to the monument can only take place with my formal consent under those Acts. Also, the Office of Public Works is charged with maintaining the monument and has full access to it for that purpose. </p>  <p>  I appreciate the significance of this national monument and its appeal to the people of Longford. I am strongly in favour of full ownership being acquired by the State.  Unfortunately previous negotiations towards that end on behalf of my Department and Longford County Council failed to achieve a successful result. In that context, the Deputy will appreciate the constraints of public procurement policy with regard to the purchase price and the requirement for value for money to be achieved. </p>  <p>  However, following further communication between my Department, the local authority and the Office of Public Works the negotiations are being reopened and I hope there will be a positive outcome.  </p></reply>

Over the last number of years, Irish talent has been a consistent presence at the Academy Awards, with Nora Twomey&rsquo;s debut animated feature, The Breadwinner, leading the Irish charge at this year's ceremony alongside other nominations for Irish talent including Saoirse Ronan, Consolata Boyle, Martin McDonagh and Daniel Day-Lewis. The industry&rsquo;s current flourishing is the result of the Irish Film Board&rsquo;s years of investment in Irish creative filmmaking talent, made possible through consistent Government backing as well as Section 481, which plays a crucial role in attracting inward production to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In partnership with the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my Department commissioned an economic analysis of our screen based creative industries.  The Report by consultants Olsberg SPI with Nordicity found that the Irish audiovisual industry, comprising Film, TV and animation; commercial advertising; and video games, supported 14,370 full-time equivalents jobs in 2016; with Gross Value Added amounting to &euro;857 million and an estimated &euro;191 million in export earnings for Ireland.  The industry also provided valuable cultural exports reaching substantial global audiences and bringing benefits to other industries such as the tourism sector.  </p>  <p>  This Report will provide an input for the development of an industry-wide long term plan for Ireland as a global hub for the production of Film, TV Drama and Animation under Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland Programme.  The Plan will set out an agenda to further develop the Irish Audiovisual Industry and in that context my Department will work with the Film Board and all sectors of the industry to address any barriers to continued success.  I intend to publish this economic report and associated plan shortly.</p></reply>

They are in every locality and community and provide tangible links to our ancient past, a sense of place for communities and focal points for social enjoyment and economic regeneration. There are over 1000 national monuments in my care, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  In recent years investment in these sites has necessarily been confined for the most part to conservation and maintenance works by the Office of Public Works which is responsible for managing them on a day- to-day basis.</p><p>To enhance the preservation and presentation of our heritage estate for the future, the Government will over the course of the <b><i>National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027</i></b>invest &euro;30 million in our national monument sites.  My Department will work closely with the Office of Public Works to ensure that these sites are conserved and presented to the highest quality. Where feasible, additional sites and monuments will also be acquired and public access improved. The quality of the visitor facilities will be improved throughout, including enhanced animation of the sites, improvements to interpretation facilities and upgrades to the visitor infrastructure at all of our primary national monument sites. </p><p>Through my Department&rsquo;s strategic partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Office of Public we will strengthen the care of our key heritage sites across Ireland&rsquo;s ancient east, the wild Atlantic way and Ireland&rsquo;s hidden heartlands. Key projects include the planned improvement works at Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, Tara, C&eacute;ide Fields, Skellig Michael, Valentia Cable Station, the Rock of Cashel and other key monastic, armada and medieval sites. In the case of Clonmacnoise, the capacity of the facilities, in particular carparking, is currently being looked at by the Office of Public Works.  </p><p>In addition to making our archaeological heritage more open and enjoyable to everyone, the increased funding now being made available will also directly support new employment in the heritage, conservation and archaeological sectors.</p></reply>

To this end, over the course of many months, we have been working tirelessly in partnership with the British Government to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to form a Northern Ireland Executive.</p>  <p>  The devolved power-sharing institutions are central to the Good Friday Agreement and are the best means for achieving accountable, representative decision-making for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately to date, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an Executive, despite intensive engagement.  In light of this, the Government has been working with the British Government to consider means by which we can support the political process, in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken with Prime Minister May and emphasised the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p>  <p>  I am in very regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as we seek a way beyond the current impasse.  Most recently, I have met Secretary of State Bradley on 10 April, 16 April, and 3 May, 2018.  We also spoke by phone on 27 April 2018.</p>  <p>  As part of these discussions, I have indicated to Secretary of State Bradley that it would be appropriate to convene the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference in order for both Governments to formally engage through the structures of the Good Friday Agreement on next steps.</p>  <p>  The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is an important institution of the Good Friday Agreement which brings together the British and Irish Governments under Strand Three of the Agreement on matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.

2018 the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman is independent in the performance of his statutory functions.  I have no role in the day to day workings of the office.</p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) was established on 01 January 2018 under the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017.  Section 18 of the Act sets out how the Ombudsman shall co-operate with the regulatory authorities with a view to ensuring that this Act operates in a way that contributes to promoting the best interests of consumers and actual or potential beneficiaries of financial or pension services and to the efficient and effective handling of complaints.</p><p>The Act provides that the Ombudsman may make recommendations to the Central Bank in relation to measures that the Bank might take in order to effectively deal with persistent patterns of complaints.  A similar provision existed in the legislation which underpinned the FSPO&rsquo;s precursor body, the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO), and the FSO and the Central Bank agreed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which sets out the terms under which both parties give effect to these provisions.  The MoU has not yet been updated to reflect the establishment of the FSPO on 1 January 2018, however, the original MoU continues to operate and is available on the FSPO website.  </p><p>The Ombudsman has informed me that while the MoU provides for regular and routine information sharing, it also provides for specific information sharing whereby the FSPO will provide the Central Bank with detailed and specific information relating to a complaint (or complaints) for its general consideration in particular instances.  </p><p>The following table outlines the details as requested by the Deputy of all matters referred by the Financial Services Ombudsman to the Central Bank of Ireland for each of the years 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017:<table><tr><th>Year:</th><th>2017 (5

complaint.  The Ombudsman dealt with the complaint but referred a broader issue raised by the Complainant which alleged that insurance providers are refusing to quote young drivers with minor accidents. </td></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Banking</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman provided the Central Bank with a copy of its finding in relation to a particular complaint, and raised a concern regarding a general consent on a loan application to allow a lender to visit or telephone any member of a customer's family, if the lender   cannot contact customer. </td></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Banking</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman provided the Central Bank with a copy of its finding in relation to a particular complaint, and raised a concern regarding the operation of bank accounts due to sanctions in other jurisdictions. </td></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Insurance</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman provided the Central Bank with a copy of its finding in relation to a particular complaint, and raised a concern regarding charges imposed by the Provider on a life policy in   circumstances where there was a lack of evidence of a contractual basis upon which the Provider has calculated and applied charges to the Complainant&rsquo;s policy.</td></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Banking</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman referred a matter to the Central Bank for its consideration arising out of concerns regarding information given by financial service providers to consumers about variable rates on personal credit agreements, in particular the failure of providers to sufficiently alert customers of the possibility that the period of the credit agreement may increase, the number of instalments may increase or the total amount   repayable may increase.</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Year:</th><th>2016 (4 Cases)</th></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Banking</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman provided the Central Bank with a copy of its finding in relation to a particular complaint, and raised a concern regarding the failure by a Financial Service Provider to comply with the European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 in particular the failure to adhere to the notification period to introduce   of fees on accounts.</td></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Banking</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman provided the Central Bank with a copy of its finding in relation to a particular complaint, and raised a concern regarding general procedures of a financial services provider whereby access to online facilities is denied to certain customers.</td></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Insurance</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman provided the

withheld by the FSP in order to repay an older loan.</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Year:</th><th>2015 (7 Cases)</th></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Investment</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman referred a matter to the Central Bank for its consideration arising out of concerns regarding the actions of a financial service provider, and its failure to engage with specified consumers.</td></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Unregulated</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman referred a matter to the Central Bank for its consideration arising out of concerns regarding the carrying out of regulated activities related to debt management without the authorisation necessary from the   Central Bank to do so.</td></tr><tr><td>Sector:</td><td>Banking</td></tr><tr><td>Reason for   Referral:</td><td>The Ombudsman provided the Central Bank with a copy of its finding in relation to a particular complaint, and raised a concern regarding the roll-over of loans and the adherence to Section 99 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 and where the loans where lawfully refinanced.

This is to enable the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to deliver further IT Development (PAYE Modernisation).  The project represents the most significant reform of the administration of the PAYE system in over fifty years.  The objective of the project is that employers, employees and Revenue will all have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information available relating to pay, tax, PRSI and USC deductions.  This will ensure that the right amount is collected at the right time from employees, and that employers pay their correct liabilities when required.</p></reply>

The proposal was agreed subject to all 5 primary school including Scoil Oilibheir Naofa agreeing a Common Application and Enrolment Policy and having a commitment to grow naturally. The Patron also agreed to ensure that all schools will not act outside the remit of the Common Application and Enrolment Policy and on this basis, schools will not be allowed to develop at the expense of other schools.</p>  <p>  My Department has, for the first time, introduced an objective, statistics based model for deciding which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS Programme, so that all stakeholders can have confidence that we are targeting extra resources at those schools with the highest concentrated levels of disadvantage. My Department will be in touch with the schools concerned shortly regarding DEIS status. </p>  <p>  The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on the Department website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  The criteria for the appointment of an administrative deputy principal to a school, which are enrolment related, are set out in Appendix B of Circular, 0010/2018. There is no scope to deviate from these arrangements.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The general approach taken in cases of amalgamation is that the existing staff of the pre-amalgamation schools can remain in the newly amalgamated school. Where this results in the newly amalgamated school having more staff than that warranted by the staffing schedule, a concessionary allocation is given to the school to allow all of the teachers remain in place. The concessionary post is only retained until such time as one of the existing cohort of teachers leaves the newly amalgamated school and, as such, is not a permanent allocation but is a temporary measure to assist in the amalgamation process.</p></reply>

SOLAS, in partnership with Construction Industry Federation (CIF) and Waterford Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB), operated a pilot initiative in the last year to test the viability of a shared apprenticeship scheme.  Following analysis of the pilot outcomes and in consultation with both the CIF and WWETB, I understand that SOLAS decided not to operationalise the pilot initiative more widely.  In particular, it was found that the pilot did not attract employers in sufficient numbers to suggest that the scheme had the potential to have a significant impact on apprenticeship recruitment.  However, I understand from SOLAS that they are currently in discussions with representatives from the construction industry to assess how the scheme could be made more viable.</p></reply>

This includes changes in the operation of contracted training where ETBs engage the services of third party providers to deliver some of their education and training provision.  These services were formerly contracted by Training Centres under the remit of F&Aacute;S. </p>  <p>  In March 2017, on behalf of the contracting authorities, consisting of 15 ETBs, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) invited expressions of interest under the restricted procedure, from suitably qualified service providers for the provision of contracted training services for which it was proposed to establish multi supplier frameworks.  Each ETB is a contracting authority in respect of the services it engages.  SOLAS does not act as a contracting authority but assisted with the co-ordination of contracting arrangements and engagement with the OGP. The competition was initiated in consideration of the completion of the term of the previous contracting arrangements.</p>  <p>  Conducted by the OGP on behalf of the contracting authorities, the competition was run in accordance with the European Communities (Award of Public Authorities&rsquo; Contracts) Regulations 2016 (as amended).  The competition is complete and each contracting authority is at varying stages of engagement with framework contractors.</p>  <p>  In light of the above, I have asked SOLAS to contact the Deputy directly to clarify the information sought, to confirm what is available and to make arrangements to furnish it directly. </p></reply>

The Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is designed to allow schools to carry out small and medium sized building works that will improve and upgrade existing school buildings.</p><p>The Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is a multi-annual Scheme.  Over 1,650 schools, nearly 50% of schools, applied for inclusion under the current round of the scheme which reflects a very high demand.</p><p>Almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the Scheme, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools, for Gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works.  Details of the successful school applicants, are published on the Department's website <i><i>www.education.ie</i></i>. </p><p>In relation to the Summer Works Scheme 2018, over &euro;25 million will be spent on summer works projects in 2018.  This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for 178 schools nationwide to be completed.  These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners in relation to giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the summer works scheme from 2019 onwards.  While the Summer Works Scheme is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in Quarter 2 as in previous years.  This will also help ensure that works done under the Summer Works Scheme fit better with any wider refurbishment/energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided in the National Development Plan.  The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of summer works projects for 2019 onwards.</p></reply>

In addition, Courts Service ICT and court technology, which is not part of the Public Private Partnership contract, was installed at a cost of &euro;327,000.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has informed me that while the Courthouse on Catherine Street was being refurbished court sittings and the Court Office relocated to temporary leased accommodation at Grace Dieu for the period from 18 May 2015 to 18 April 2018.

The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, provides explicit statutory protection for what are termed &ldquo;peace officers&rdquo;, which include members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, prison officers, members of the fire brigade, ambulance personnel and members of the Defence Forces.  The Act also covers those working in medical services in hospitals, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists and others involved in the provision of treatment and care.  Section 19 of the 1994 Act provides that any person who assaults or threatens to assault any of these front-line workers is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term of up to 7 years or both.  The maximum sentence was increased from 5 years to 7 years under the 2006 Act.     </p>  <p>  It is also an offence under the 1994 Act, as amended, to resist, wilfully obstruct or impede a peace officer, or medical staff in a hospital, in the course of carrying out their work.  The penalty on summary conviction for such an offence is a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months or both.   </p>  <p>  In addition, in the case of assault causing serious harm, an offender can be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which deals comprehensively with a wide range of assault provisions, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties.  That Act provides for penalties of up to 5 years in prison for an offence of assault causing harm and for a penalty of life imprisonment for an offence of causing serious harm.  This general law relating to assault has application to all citizens, including front-line emergency workers.   </p>  <p>  In conclusion, the law already recognises the need to protect members of the emergency services carrying out their duties and provides strong penalties where offences against front-line workers are committed.  While there are currently no proposals for further legislation in this regard, the situation is kept under review.</p></reply>

I can say however, that the person concerned was refused permission to enter the State on 2 May 2018 and left the State on the same day. He is not the subject of an Irish Deportation Order. </p><p>The following matters pertain in all cases where a person is refused permission to enter the State.</p><p>- There are in total twelve (12) grounds on which an immigration officer may refuse to give a permission to enter the State and these are set out at Section 4 (3) of the Immigration Act 2004 (as amended by the International protection Act 2015). While a person may be refused permission to enter the State based on a number of grounds, such refusal need only be based on any one of those grounds. Immigration officers are required to provide a written notice to the person refused entry that sets out the reasons for the decision. In all cases, removals from the State are conducted in accordance with the law. Translation facilities are available where necessary.</p><p>- An Immigration Officer before confirming a decision to refuse permission will consult with his or her Supervisor.</p><p>- Removals are essentially operational matters for the Garda National Immigration Bureau who work closely with civilian immigration officers on these matters.</p><p>- Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 2003 (as amended by the International protection Act, 2015), contains the main provisions dealing with the removal from the State of persons refused leave to land and specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State, which must be as soon as is practicable. </p><p>- It is the practice to remove persons from the State on the next available flight or ship. </p><p>It should be noted that should any person who has been refused leave to land in the State seek entry to the State at a future point, their application will be assessed on its own merits taking all relevant information into consideration at that time. Their prior immigration history is a matter of record but does not preclude them from seeking permission to enter the State in the future.</p></reply>

The Ardmore site is currently zoned for Film Industry use only, and this protection is due to run for at least 5 more years under the Bray Municipal District Local Area plan.  The site cannot be used for non-Film Industry development without the agreement of Wicklow County Council to alter the current zoning restriction. </p>  <p>  In relation to the sale price, the commercial rationale and other specific financial details, I am unable to reveal what are confidential details of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s minority shareholding disposal transaction in what is a privately held company.  This applies to the Ardmore transaction as it would to any other individual investment or share disposal of Enterprise Ireland where it is a minority shareholder in a privately held company.</p>  <p>  What I can however confirm is that Enterprise Ireland negotiated the sale of its shareholding with the benefit of comprehensive due diligence undertaken by independent consultants and is satisfied that it realised full market value, and on a par with the other majority shareholder parties.  </p>  <p>  The Government had committed that the company would be sold as a going concern and that is what has happened while realising full commercial value for the shareholders selling the company, including Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  Investment is required in the Ardmore studio&rsquo;s facilities to secure its long term commercial future and the Olcott Entertainment deal provides the potential to breathe new life into the company at a time when the market for film production in Ireland is again showing good growth potential.</p>  <p>  I understand that Olcott plans to develop and expand the Ardmore Studio offering, and other related entertainment projects, and to retain the current experienced Ardmore management and staff.</p>  <p>  The promoters of Olcott Entertainment have a strong track record in the film production industry.  This acquisition will ensure Ardmore Studios continues to be a world class film studio.  It can also strengthen the potential of Ireland as a location for film production and take advantage of new opportunities in emerging areas including on-demand TV, content and gaming production.</p>  <p>  Overall, I am confident that the sale will not only continue to ensure high quality production of current projects, but will also provide continued investment in the studio, and employment opportunities for the skilled workers in the area.</p></reply>

A notice can be served by a Local Authority on any person in charge of any premises, processes or works, other than an activity controlled by the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, separate event licensing regulations exist which are also a matter for the Local Authorities.</p><p>The remit of my Department in connection with concert halls and cinemas is limited to their status as places of employment and the measures that must be taken by employers in the entertainment industry to protect employees from the harmful effects of loud music.  </p><p>In February 2008, the Control of Noise at Work Part 5 (Chapter 1) of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 came into force for the music and entertainment sector in Ireland. The regulations mean that employers have a legal duty to protect their staff from the potential harmful effects of loud music. The regulations apply to any workplace where there is live or recorded music.</p><p>The regulations state that any employer in this sector must:</p><p>- Make a determination and carry out an assessment of risks of exposure of employees to noise at their work</p><p>- Give particular attention when carrying out this assessment to the effects of exposure on employees whose safety or health is at particular risk from such exposure</p><p>- Ensure the noise is either eliminated at source or reduced to a minimum</p><p>- Take account of other methods of work which eliminate or reduce exposure to noise in the choice of work equipment and in the design or layout of places of work, by noise reduction measures and by work organisation</p><p>- Prevent exposure above 85dB(A)</p><p>- Provide personal protective equipment if this level is exceeded</p><p>- Provide employees with information, training and relating to risks resulting from exposure to noise</p><p>- Provide health surveillance including audiometric and hearing checks to employees exposed to noise at work</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority has also produced information sheets and guidelines for the entertainment sector at the following links.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The Director General advised that the business was based outside the State, concerned with research and development and was not engaged in business with the HSE. He advised that the functions would be performed in his own time without detriment to his work as Director General.  He indicated that normal directors' fees would be payable.  He also advised that all necessary taxation and Standards in Public Office declarations would be made.</p>  <p>  Approval was conveyed in principle on 6th June on the basis that the business was based outside the State and is neither competitive with or engaging in business with the HSE and that the functions would be performed on his own time and without detriment to his work as DG of the HSE.</p>  <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien was asked to provide further details of the company, the estimated time commitment and fee arrangement to the Secretary General of the Department of Health in order that the matter could be finalised. </p>  <p>  On 7 December, Mr. O&rsquo;Brien advised that the company in question is Evofem Biosciences Inc. based in San Diego, California which focuses on women&rsquo;s healthcare. Its research and development particularly covers areas of unmet medical need in contraception, sexually transmitted infection and for the prevention of recurrence of bacterial vaginosis.</p>  <p>  On 20 December 2017, the Secretary General, with my consent, confirmed approval to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien taking up the appointment subject to confirmation of details on remuneration and time commitment, and subject to the proviso that I, as Minister, reserve the right to review consent should a conflict of interest arise in the future or should there be any negative impact on Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s work as Director General.</p>  <p>  On 25 January, 2018 Mr. O&rsquo;Brien confirmed that he had been formally appointed to the Board of Evofem Biosciences Inc. on a non-executive basis.  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien also confirmed that Directors' fees payable to him amount to US$ 65,000 per annum exclusive of stock participation options.</p>  <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien has advised that he envisaged that his time commitment would amount to 5 hours per month and that his attendance at Board meetings would be linked to periods of annual leave. Mr. O&rsquo;Brien also confirmed that the company has no products which have FDA approval and therefore no products on the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien has informed me that he is taking a leave of absence from his approved external non-executive board position with Evofem Biosciences Inc. until July.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  Under the primary legislation an NHSS applicant may apply for certain items of expenditure to be taken into account and netted off against their means prior to the calculation of their contribution.  These items are referred to as allowable deductions.  An applicant can apply for the following to be deducted:</p>  <p>  - Interest on loans for the purchase, repair or improvement of the applicant&rsquo;s principal primary residence; and</p>  <p>  - Rent paid on the principal residence of the applicant only so long as the person&rsquo;s partner, or a child under the age of 21 years of the person or the person&rsquo;s partner resides in the principal residence.</p></reply>

The number of GPs on the specialist register continues to increase &ndash; up from 2,270 in 2010 to 3,661 as of 1st May 2018 and there are now 2,491 GPs contracted by the HSE under the GMS scheme compared to 2,098 in 2008.  It should be noted that as of 1st March there were only 23 GMS panels that do not have a permanent GP in place &ndash; a vacancy rate of less than 1%.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has also taken steps to expand GP training.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and this year we expect to fill 194 places, an increase of over 60% in this nine year period.  The Programme for Government commits to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years.</p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to engaging with GP representatives on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the current GMS contract.  Our goal is to develop a contractual framework that has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion, disease prevention and for the structured care of chronic conditions.  This will enable general practitioners to better meet the needs of patients and will also promote general practice as a viable and rewarding career for both existing doctors and future medical graduates.</p></reply>

A site in Inchicore has been identified for development of a Housing with Support model under Rebuilding Ireland which will deliver 52 homes and is due for completion in 2020.  This is a collaborative project and it is intended to set a new standard for the future of housing provision for older people and to act as an exemplar for others to follow.  The project has been approved for funding of almost &euro;15m under the Department of Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme with a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the Health Service Executive towards additional communal facilities for the residents.</p>  <p>  The project is aimed at offering older people who do not require nursing home care the benefits of living in their own homes, connected to their own communities, with support and care provided in a cost-effective way.  It is envisaged that this demonstration project will be adapted and replicated in other areas.</p>  <p>  In addition, I as Minister of State with responsibility for older people, together with my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for housing Damien English, intend to hold an expert conference on housing for older people in Autumn this year. </p></reply>

Current prices stand at &euro;139.54/100 kg which is 15% below prices at the same time in 2017 (an exceptional year for pig prices) but remain above the price at the same stage in 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have made a substantial effort to encourage market diversification.  The importance of this is illustrated by the significant expansion in Ireland&rsquo;s pig meat exports to East Asia and to China in particular.  The ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit lends an even greater importance to expansion of access to international markets.</p>  <p>  In June of 2017 I visited Mexico, the fourth largest importer of chilled and frozen pork in the world. With Mexican demand continuing to grow I have made access to that market a top priority.  I also travelled to Japan and the Republic of Korea last autumn to promote the development of further opportunities for Irish producers in these markets as I want to continue the diversification of markets to which Ireland has access.  Exports to Japan more than doubled to &euro;22m in 2017, putting it in second place in international markets.  We can also expect that the new free trade agreement with Japan (JEEPA) will further enhance trade opportunities.  Growth in the Philippines was also strong, up 54%, making it the third-largest international market for Irish pigmeat exports.  China is now the largest third country market with exports of &euro;102m last year.  I will lead a trade mission to China this month visiting Beijing and Shanghai.  This visit will include events, in association with Bord Bia, to promote Irish pork to further develop export opportunities.</p>  <p>  With Irish production up 1.2% in 2017 and export value increasing by 8% to &euro;790 million, I will continue to work closely with the sector and, by focusing on insight-led growth strategies, take advantage of opportunities for Irish pig meat exporters on international markets.</p></reply>

The PMG has met each month since September 2017 and has considered seven months of pricing data trends.  The PMG has indicated that, in the vast majority of cases to date, prices have remained stable.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is also currently conducting a separate study on the operation of the household waste collection market which it will complete in 2018.</p><p>The results from the PMG in conjunction with the study being undertaken by the CCPC will provide an evidence base for future policy decisions in relation to the household waste market.​</p><p>The charges applied by waste management companies (including standing or service charges) are matters for those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.</p><p>Issues concerning the amendment of consumer contracts do not fall within my remit as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Consumer protection queries should be directed to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC).</p><p>However, in line with the commitments set out in <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i>, published in 2012, and in the interest of encouraging further waste prevention and greater recycling, flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection are being phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018, as customers' contracts come up for renewal.  The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place in terms of requiring household waste collectors to phase out flat rate fees.</p><p>It is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per-lift or a weight-related fee.</p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per-kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced.  Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group which I co-chair with Minister of State Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.</p><p>Minister of State Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce.  Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme.  Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland.</p><p>In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:</p><p>- My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p><p>- Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots.  This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.  This exercise is ongoing and has been included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme.  It is planned to have dedicated Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in place to support this.</p><p>- Under Action 40 of the 2016 Report, a review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots.  This work is continuing in 2018 under a focus group to inform future policy development and initiatives, in providing guidance with respect to specific categories of locations where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority, taking account of customer expectations.</p><p>- ComReg is also delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p><p>All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p><p>In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.  Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p><p>In terms of tackling broadband deficiencies, the Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that today almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  Since this Government has come into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.  This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State-led intervention.  The procurement process is now in the final stages.</p><p>Providing telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator.  I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to roll out services and make specific investments in particular locations.  The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.</p><p>A national list of Broadband Officers can be found at the below link.</p></reply>

There is no USO for high speed broadband provision or mobile voice services in Ireland and the Framework does not provide for it.  In September 2016, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks.  I have raised the issue of a USO for high speed broadband at EU level, seeking inclusion of a specific provision in the new framework that would allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, where such networks are available.  Negotiations on the initiative are continuing at EU level. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband to every premises in the country, through a State led intervention in areas where such networks are not available.  The winning bidder in the procurement process will be required to build out a wholesale, open access, high speed broadband network.  Under a 25 year contract with the Department, they will be required to connect all premises within the Intervention area with a high speed connection (minimum 30 megabits per second download and 6 megabits per second upload).</p>  <p>  The NBP will deliver the network that will be required to connect all premises.  While USO alone could not be expected to deliver new high speed broadband networks of this scale, I am of the view that where high speed broadband networks are available, USO could provide a very useful tool to ensure that all premises within a network area can get a reliable, quality connection.  This is particularly relevant in cities and towns where commercial operators have already deployed high speed networks, but for technical or other reasons some premises still may not be able to obtain services.   </p>  <p>  My Department is also in discussion with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) as to whether a USO may be a viable instrument in instances where a high speed network is available, but individual premises cannot access such services at an affordable price. </p></reply>

A detailed note of these projects is included for the Deputy's information while information on projects which fall under the remit of agencies has been requested and replies will issue to the Deputy in due course. </p><p><b>Reply by Programme</b></p><p><b>Programme A &ndash; Civil Aviation </b></p><p>The capital allocation in 2018 for grant support towards safety and security projects at the regional airports under the Regional Airports Programme is &euro;3.85 million. </p><p>Applications for grant support under the Programme are invited on an annual basis and these applications are assessed by my Department, in conjunction with the IAA, against the criteria set out in the Programme.</p><p>My Department is currently finalising its consideration of this year&rsquo;s applications from the airports and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in this regard shortly.</p><p><b>Programme B- Public Transport </b></p><p>Budget 2018 provided a four-year enhanced capital envelope for public transport of over &euro;2.7 billion to 2021 including funding of over &euro;400 million for investment in public transport in 2018.  This increased funding will allow rollout of a number of key programmes to address congestion and emerging capacity constraints on our public transport system across our cities.  It includes: </p><p>- investment of more than &euro;750m for the BusConnects programme - a transformative investment to enhance and expand the bus network, improving bus access through and around the Capital, and including designated segregated cycle lanes.</p><p>- over &euro;110 million for new urban cycling and walking routes in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), and in Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford Cities areas, which will provide additional sustainable travel options to complement increased capacity and faster, higher quality public transport in our main cities. </p><p>- over &euro;220 million capital investment in additional heavy rail infrastructure between now and 2021.  This will deliver:  the City Centre Re-signalling Project to improve speeds on mainline rail; a new rail Central Traffic Control Centre; progress on the DART Expansion Programme to include increase rail fleet and further progress on electrification of both the Northern rail line to Balbriggan and the Maynooth line.</p><p>- funding of almost &euro;460 million investment in light rail for additional Luas capacity - with additional trams and longer trams across the Luas network - and to progress the Metro Link, with construction work starting on the project in 2021, and passenger services commencing in 2027.</p><p>- investment in maintenance and safety projects to maintain safety and service levels in railway operations of our national railway system.</p><p>- multi-annual funding of almost &euro;30 million over the next four years to continue the programme of retro-fitting older, existing public transport facilities to improve their accessibility features.  This effectively triples the previously planned investment amount.</p><p>- funding in the region of &euro;130 million over the next four years for traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects in our cities.</p><p>- &euro;35 million to back new ideas that will help decarbonise the transport sector, including pilot initiatives for low emission technologies.</p><p>This is complemented by the investing of &euro;15 million in lower energy lighting on national roads.</p><p>The recently published National Development Plan (NDP), which will run from 2018 to 2027, builds on this enhanced 4-year capital allocation and will enable extensive investment across Ireland's transport sector, supporting the overall development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system.  </p><p>It is worth noting that as part of the annual Estimates process, the multi-annual capital allocations for Government Departments under the NDP will be reviewed and extended annually on a rolling basis to cover the coming 5-year period.  This will provide Government with an annual opportunity to review the allocations in light of any implementation issues arising and/or new priorities which may emerge as the NDP is implemented.  </p><p>The NDP also commits to a full mid-term review of the Plan in 2022, to allow Government to take stock of progress in terms of delivery of the planned projects and programmes, and to allow Government to review and reaffirm its investment priorities.  It is envisaged that the review will be carried out in order to prepare and publish a new updated 10-year plan for public capital investment in 2023, covering the period 2023 to 2032. </p><p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) and Irish Rail have responsibility for the development and implementation of public transport infrastructure projects and therefore I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to both organisations for further information on the issues raised.</p><p><b>Programme B. Roads </b></p><p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  Each local authority is the contracting authority for the purpose of implementation of regional and local road improvement projects.  </p><p>My Department is committed to providing grant funding to 13 projects at present under the capital investment plan.  The current status of each of these projects is set out in the table below. As regards grant expenditure to date for these projects, this information is included in the Regional and Local Roads Payment and Allocations Booklets which are available in the Oireachtas library.<table><tr><th><b>Capital Plan Regional and Local Road Projects</b></th><th><div><b>DTTaS Grant</b><br /><br /><b>&euro;m</b></div></th><th><div><b>Current</b><br /><br /><b>Status</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Dingle Relief Road - Phase 4</td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>At construction</div></td></tr><tr><td>Bettystown to Laytown Link Road</td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>At planning stage</div></td></tr><tr><td>Adamstown &amp;amp; Nangor Road Upgrade</td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>At Construction</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sallins By-Pass / Osberstown </td><td><div>57</div></td><td><div>At Construction</div></td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Crossing Bridge at Killaloe</td><td><div>16</div></td><td><div>At land acquisition stage</div></td></tr><tr><td>Athy Southern Distributor Road</td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>Land acquisition &amp;amp; advance works</div></td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise Southern Relief Road</td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>At tender stage</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo Eastern Garavogue Link Road</td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>Land acquisition &amp;amp; advance works</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo Western Distributor road </td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>Land Acquisition &amp;amp; advance works</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tralee Northern Relief Road</td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>Detailed Appraisal</div></td></tr><tr><td>R498 Latteragh Realignment</td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>At planning stage</div></td></tr><tr><td>Killaloe Bypass/R494 Upgrade</td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>At land acquisition stage</div></td></tr><tr><td>Coonagh to Knockalisheen</td><td><div>42</div></td><td><div>At land acquisition &amp;amp; advance works</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the national road projects, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  </p><p>Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.  I have, therefore referred the Deputy's Question to TII for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p><p><b>Programme D. Sports and Recreation Services </b></p><p>We do have commitments in relation to some large individual projects such as Parc Ui Chaoimh, Kerry Sports Academy at IT Tralee and swimming pool projects like Castlebar. Our existing capital envelopes cover all such commitments.</p><p>The two projects below are currently underway at the National Sports Campus.</p><p>- Worked on the development of Phase 2 of the National Indoor Arena is underway and is due for completion in mid-2019</p><p>- Work on new office accommodation for Sport Ireland and a National Governing Body of sport is underway with completion expected in mid-2018.</p></reply>

They deserve to be recognised, valued and respected for this.  My Department does, however, acknowledge that pay and conditions are major issues facing the sector.  My Department is engaging with the early years sector to explore how this can be addressed.</p>  <p>  In relation to pay and conditions for the Early Years sector, it must be noted that my Department is not the employer of childcare workers.  However, in terms of improving pay and conditions I have engaged directly with the sector, and have suggested  that one approach the sector could consider is applying for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO) through the Labour Court, seeking a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years' sector.</p>  <p>  Under a SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders.  My Department would not be a party to the SEO process, however, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, my Department would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the matter of the application for a SEO for the sector.  I have indicated on many occasions that I will be very supportive of any reasonable measures aimed at improving pay and conditions of the Early Years sector.  While my Department does not have direct control over the matter, it will continue to support any appropriate initiatives in this area.</p>  <p>  In the last budget I also secured a 7% increase in capitation for the ECCE scheme, the first such rise in many years.  It is my hope that this increase in funding will be reflected in pay within the sector.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has committed to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare.  This review is examining the costs faced by childcare providers in delivering quality childcare, including a survey of childcare providers.  Following completion- the review is intended to be used to strengthen the evidence base underpinning future policy development and investment in early years.  As such, it will feed into future policy development, including in relation to levels of payments to services.</p></reply>

This will bring the total current youth funding available to my Department to &euro;58.9m.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people.  Funding to staff-led youth services has generally been targeted at areas of disadvantage and not in proportion to the youth population of a county.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware my Department is managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken.  This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention.</p>  <p>  Last year each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards, including Cork ETB, was invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for the establishment of new services and to nominate a project or service to be considered for augmentation.  In total twenty-eight applications for new services were received.  Subsequently I approved the establishment of nine new targeted youth services across the country and the expansion of a further seven to respond to new demand and needs of young people which included new services in Mitchelstown and Carrigaline and an augmented service in Middleton.</p>  <p>  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed last year which mapped youth service provision across the State.  This mapping will assist the Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with Cork ETB to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government (2016) gives a commitment to develop a Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) Youth Strategy.  This is a key commitment for my Department in the Programme for Government and also makes a contribution towards the Government&rsquo;s broader commitment to continue to strive for full inclusion of LGBT people in Ireland.  The development of this Strategy will be led by my Department.  The final Strategy is scheduled for publication in the end of Quarter 2 2018.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are currently examining possibilities for a multi-annual capital programme for childcare as well as research on existing capital holdings and future capital needs for the sector, at national and local level.  Once gathered, this data will be used to inform large-scale, targeted capital investments in childcare.</p></reply>

The MWP report itself was published in April 2017 following a commitment in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy 2015 -2024 and was undertaken in order to better identify how people with disabilities could be supported to achieve their employment ambitions.  </p>  <p>  The consultation reflects a commitment made at the time of the publication of the MWP report to consult widely with persons with disabilities and their families in relation to the number of recommendations about the principle of early engagement and a proposed reconfiguration of the Disability Allowance (DA) payment.  One MWP recommendation is to support young adults through education, training and social inclusion according to their capacity, and to change the lowest qualifying age for DA from 16 to 18 years.  The other recommendation was to adopt an early engagement approach in order to support the employment ambitions of people with disabilities.  Early engagement would mean that the State will support people with disabilities at the earliest stage possible to help them achieve their employment goals.  To this end, people with disabilities would begin receiving assistance, advice and support from the departments Intreo service or other related services when they apply for a disability income support payment.  </p>  <p>  At the launch of the consultation process, I together with the Minister of State for Disabilities made clear that engagement would be voluntary: in other words, it would be a matter for persons with disabilities themselves to decide whether they wanted to avail of the supports offered through the Intreo service.  This has been stressed at all stages throughout the consultation process.  </p>  <p>  The national consultation process concluded on April 13th and now will be followed by further consideration of the results with a stakeholder focus group.  This group is comprised of persons with experience of disability issues and was established last September and has helped my Department with the design of the national consultation process.  </p>  <p>  I together with my Government colleagues, look forward to learning the outcome of the consultation process in due course.  The Government will then consider what actions will best support the overall objective of improving employment outcomes for persons with a disability.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

There are currently just over 36,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of HAP payments. A weekly average of 357 HAP tenancies are been set-up during 2018. </p>  <p>  HAP is a form of social housing support under which local authorities make monthly payments on behalf of tenants directly to landlords in respect of rent, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme. All the terms and conditions of the HAP scheme for both tenants and landlords are available on the dedicated HAP website, www.hap.ie, and associated HAP documentation.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme. As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. HAP recipients are required to set up automatic electronic rent payment arrangements. </p>  <p>  Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions. Accordingly, the day-to-day operation of the social housing system, including HAP, is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  In addition, with regard to differential rent, section 58(3) of the Housing Act 1966 provides that, subject to such Regulations, as may be made by the Minister under the section, a housing authority may charge such rent or other payment, as they may determine from time to time, in respect of a dwelling of which they are the owner. The making and amending of rent schemes and the administration of such schemes is accordingly the responsibility of housing authorities, as an integral part of their housing management functions. </p>  <p>  There is an onus on local authorities to ensure that the administration of rents and associated matters are undertaken within the framework of an effective system for the proper management and maintenance of the housing stock.  Rental income is the main source of funding for the management and maintenance of dwellings. Rent schemes developed should ensure that the overall rental income reflects adequately, insofar as it is practicable to do so, the cost of management and maintenance of the local authority's rented housing stock and enables the authority to fulfil its obligations to its tenants in regard to the management and maintenance of their dwellings. Broad principles in relation to this matter were laid down by my Department via Circular letter and associated guidelines, which drew on an extensive process of consultation with local authority practitioners, were also issued which should be of assistance in  achieving good practice in the administration of rent related matters.</p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC applies a very clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. </p>  <p>  Outside of issuing the formal notification letters, there would always be attempts to contact the tenants by phone and by email to settle accounts and avoid escalation of the debt process. Depending on the activity of arrears in question, both the relevant local authority and the landlord are informed when an account has not been cleared and of possible suspension and/ or cessation of the HAP payment. However, in the vast majority of cases a payment plan to deal with the arrears is agreed between the tenant and the local authority, before there is any necessity to advise the landlord. </p>  <p>  If the tenant does not contact their local authority or does not enter into a payment arrangement within 8 weeks of the arrears commencing, both the landlord and the tenant are informed that the HAP payment may be ceased. </p>  <p>  To date, the approach has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2017, when nearly 18,000 additional households were supported by HAP, the scheme had a 98% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

This is in recognition of the exceptional nature of the activities carried out by local authorities in responding to these types of emergencies and the fact that the costs of these un-programmed activities cannot be met from within existing resources.</p><p>Requests for recoupment of these costs have been received from Mayo County Council in each of the years 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and are in respect of a series of severe weather events that affected Mayo (and other parts of the country). The amounts claimed and the amounts recouped are set out in the table below. A claim for recoupment of response and clean-up costs relating to the recent severe cold weather and snow has been sought from Mayo County Council and is awaited.</p><p>Following the severe storms of winter 2013/2014 and the resulting widespread damage to public infrastructure particularly in Atlantic coastal counties, the Government decided to make funding of up to &euro;69.5m available to local authorities to assist them in supporting communities affected by restoring roads, coastal protection, and other amenities/facilities that had been damaged. It was agreed that the funding would be made available via the Votes of the appropriate Departments, i.e. Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine; the Office of Public Works and my own Department.  While my Department had an initial role in collating details and costs of damage in the immediate aftermath of the severe weather based on returns and estimates provided by local authorities, the other Departments and Offices listed above liaised directly with the local authorities on funding falling under their remit. </p><p>In the case of funding requirements relating to this event which fell under the remit of my Department, which included certain tourism infrastructure funded by the local authorities and certain piers, harbours and other facilities in the charge of the local authorities, a total of &euro;784,000 was sought by Mayo County Council with &euro;189,000 recouped in 2014 and  &euro;594,100 recouped in 2015. </p><p>It was a matter for individual local authorities to decide which projects were to be progressed and in which timescales with priority being given to works that were significant for economic activity and to support the tourism industry in particular. </p><p>Mayo County Council<table><tr><th></th><th>Claimed </th><th>Recouped</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>509,000</td><td>509,000</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>480,000</td><td>480,000</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>413,000</td><td>413,000</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>5,714</td><td>5,714</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,407,714</td><td>1,407,714</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The local authorities then seek recoupment of the amounts paid from my Department.  Where a local authority pays a grant under the scheme, my Department will repay the local authority 100% of the amount paid.</p><p>Full details of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, are set out in the explanatory leaflet and application form published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>The grants scheme ensures that the limited financial resources available are targeted towards householders, particularly those on lower incomes, who incur expenditure directly as a result of the inspection scheme.  My Department is revising this scheme to better support the programme of measures in the finalised River Basin Management Plan 2018 - 2021 published recently. The scheme is being extended in order to provide particular support to high status waters and areas identified for priority action in the River Basin Management Plan.</p><p>I have recently approved the establishment of a Working Group to conduct a review of the wider investment needs relating to rural water services. The review will focus on the actions required to improve and sustain rural water services and will consider issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, in addition to capital investment priorities and requirements across all elements of rural water services, including domestic waste water treatment systems. The establishment of the Working Group is being undertaken in response to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.</p><p>Householders who do not meet the eligibility criteria for the grant under the aforementioned Regulations and who wish to remediate or upgrade their on-site treatment systems may qualify for relief under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme introduced pursuant to section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  The HRI Scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including the repair or replacement of septic tanks. The Scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and full details are published on the Revenue Commissioners' website at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

A cross Department/Agency steering group chaired by my Department with representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Community and Rural Development,  the Health Service Executive, the Housing Agency and other key stakeholders was established in 2017 to consider the issues and to provide input into the drafting of a policy statement on housing options for older people.  </p>  <p>  The draft statement, which will be jointly published by my Department and the Department of Health, is currently being finalised and I expect it to be ready for publication shortly. This will be a first step in the broader process of seeking to ensure that older people are provided with appropriate accommodation options suited to their needs. The policy statement will set out a framework by which the Government can facilitate housing, including housing with care, for older people having regard to current demographics and looking at best practice models. The aim is to ensure that people can grow older and live in a community of their choosing, with dignity and independence.</p>  <p>  Part of the St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate site in Inchicore, owned by Dublin City Council, has been identified as a 'Housing with Support' demonstration project under Rebuilding Ireland. It will deliver 52 homes and is intended to set a new standard for the future of housing provision for older people and to act as an exemplar for others to follow.  </p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Housing with Support&rsquo; model brings together a range of services and supports - principally relating to housing, community, social and care needs - that enables older persons to live full lives in their own homes within their own community, thereby both promoting independence and reducing or deferring the need to move into long term residential care. The overall aim is to develop a new model of housing for older people where the key components, physical environment and care supports are provided on-site, integrated into the community and are designed with older people at the core.  </p>  <p>  The project has been approved for funding of almost &euro;15 million under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme with a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the HSE towards additional communal facilities for the residents. Circle Voluntary Housing Association and Alone have been commissioned to design, build and operate the project.</p></reply>

Culture Ireland supports Irish artists at 500 events in about 60 different countries every year and in 2017, Culture Ireland supported activities reached an audience of more than 3.5 million people and over 7 million online/radio/tv viewers, introducing Irish arts and the strength of Ireland's creativity culture to new and disparate audiences.</p><p>Throughout 2018, Culture Ireland is promoting a special year long programme which is planned to celebrate and renew the unique cultural relationship which exists between Ireland and Great Britain.

Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  </p><p>Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.  A wide range of other monuments (of the order of 130,000) are currently subject to protection under other provisions of the National Monuments Acts but my Department and the Office of Public Works do not have a direct role in their maintenance except where, as already noted, a monument is a national monument of which I am the owner or guardian.</p><p>Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. </p><p>I draw on information provided by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, maintained by my Department, to recommend structures for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.  However, the final decision is a reserved function of the planning authority.  I understand that Kildare County Council employs both an architectural conservation officer and a heritage officer.  There is also a monuments advisory committee in the county. </p><p>In addition to the statutory role of Local Authorities, Financial support is provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.  &euro;2m has been provided for the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2018.  370 projects have been approved for funding, including 15 projects in County Kildare for which aggregate grant aid of &euro;50,000 has been approved.  &euro;1,324,000 has been provided for the Structures at Risk Fund 2018.  76 projects across the country have been approved for funding, including for three projects in County Kildare with an aggregate grant aid of &euro;66,000.</p><p>In terms of funding for future years,<i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027</i>represents a major capital investment scheme of close to &euro;1.3 billion in funding over the next 10 years.  This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country.  More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

For example, over the last number of years, Irish talent has been a consistent presence at the Academy Awards, with Nora Twomey&rsquo;s debut animated feature, &quot;The Breadwinner&quot;, leading the Irish charge at the most recent ceremony alongside other nominations for Irish talent including Saoirse Ronan, Consolata Boyle, Martin McDonagh and Daniel Day-Lewis.  The industry&rsquo;s current flourishing is the result of the IFB&rsquo;s years of investment in Irish creative filmmaking talent, made possible through consistent Government backing as well as Section 481, which plays a crucial role in attracting inward production to Ireland.  </p><p>The Irish Film Board is the national development agency for Irish film making and the Irish film, television and animation industry.  Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  </p><p>The Film Board also supports the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  The Board liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise opportunities for the promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions as well as a tourism destination.  The other primary mechanism through which the Government supports the film industry is Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the film tax relief scheme.  In Budget 2018, I allocated an increase of &euro;1.55 million to the Irish Film Board to build on its vital work in supporting Irish film, television drama, documentary and animation.  This increases its annual budget by 9.3% to &euro;18 million.  Last month, the Government&rsquo;s capital investment plan <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018- 2027 </i>provides for funding of &euro;200m to be invested in media production and audio visual industries through the Irish Film Board over the next 10 years which will have a positive impact right across the country. </p><p>This will assist in realising the vision under Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland Programme to develop Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production.</p></reply>
