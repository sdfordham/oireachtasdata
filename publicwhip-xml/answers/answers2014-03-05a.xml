Resources allocated and numbers supported via the back to education allowance (BTEA) have increased steadily in recent years and it is estimated that almost &euro;183m will be spent on it in 2014.  Some 25,000 participants are being supported in the 2013/14 academic year and it is expected that numbers availing of the scheme for the current academic year will be similar to last year.  BTEA enables eligible persons to pursue approved full-time education courses that leads to a higher qualification than that already held and to continue to receive income support for the duration of a course of study, subject to conditions.  BTEA covers full-time second level courses and third-level courses to higher diploma level (level 8 in the national framework of qualifications), including the professional diploma in education (primary and secondary teaching).  The guidelines governing the operation of the programme are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for student support type schemes administered by the Department of Education and Skills.  Progression in education is a condition to access BTEA and it should be noted that is not a requirement unique to the programme as other State supports for education purposes are grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.</p><p>  The Department published a policy review and high level issues paper of all Employment Support Schemes including the BTEA scheme in early 2013.  The review was focused primarily on assessing the contribution certain programmes can make to the Department&rsquo;s overall activation policy.  The recommendations of this review - and the feedback from a stakeholders&rsquo; forum which was held to consider the review - are being implemented, including those relating to the progression requirements and the focusing of BTEA on the skill needs to support future economic opportunities.  Overall, the priority for the Department is that the BTEA scheme will be focused, targeted and suitable for the needs of jobseekers and of the future skills needs of the economy.  It is only in that context will changes to BTEA be considered. </p></reply>

The purpose of JobBridge is to provide jobseekers with the opportunity to gain the workplace experience which will equip them to compete for and secure paid employment.  As the Deputy will be aware many jobseekers, and in particular young jobseekers, find themselves in something of a catch-22 situation.  They cannot secure employment without recent employment experience but they cannot secure experience without employment.  As independent research and personal testimony from many interns shows, JobBridge is very effective at breaking this vicious circle.  Interns develop skills and gain experience both key attributes on any CV.  In addition, JobBridge interns also receive a top-up on their jobseeker payment of &euro;50 per week and have the security of working within a State-sponsored internship structure.  This structure ensures a standard internship agreement, a maximum working hours limit, a requirement for coaching and mentoring of the interns, regular reporting from the host organisation and random inspections by officials of my Department.  This is much preferable to the uncontrolled, &lsquo;free market&rsquo; internships which operated in many employment sectors in Ireland and overseas and whose use was increasing prior to the introduction of JobBridge. </p><p>  I am satisfied therefore that internships of the type referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are an appropriate form of employment support and they will continue to be supported by the Department.  There have been 21 placements in the first organisation mentioned and 2 placements in the second organisation since JobBridge commenced.  There are no JobBridge positions currently advertised for either organisation.</p></reply>

The purpose of this service is to support employers to increase employment and to provide a mechanism through which jobseekers can search for job openings and submit applications.</p><p>  An important feature of Jobs-Ireland is that, unlike some other recruitment websites, the Department seeks to validate the jobs offered by confirming that the advertiser is a bona-fide employer.  Towards this end, all employers who wish to avail of this service are required to register their company prior to using the service and are issued a service level understanding which sets out the terms and conditions of use of the service.</p><p>  All vacancies advertised on the Jobs-Ireland service are advertised in good faith on behalf of the employer following the registration process.  The Department does not seek information from employers when they are submitting individual vacancy notices about previous company closures or redundancies.  In practice, companies may be operating in a number of geographic areas or in different business sectors. Accordingly, some companies may be simultaneously hiring in one area or sector, while reducing numbers in a different areas or sector.  This means that it would be very difficult to isolate opportunistic behaviour of the type referred to by the Deputy while at the same time providing an easy to use and accessible service to the large majority of bona fide employers and jobseekers. </p><p>  The Jobs-Ireland service has not received any complaints from members of the public or employers engaging in the practice the Deputy has outlined.  I would encourage the Deputy to bring any such cases that he is aware of to the attention of the Department and they will be investigated.  If the companies concerned are found to be operating in breach of the service level understanding or of employment law related to recruitment they will be barred from using the Jobs-Ireland service.</p><p>  I would also bring the Deputy's attention to the Workplace Relations Customer Services function established by the Government under the aegis of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This service amalgamates the information services previously provided by the National Employment Rights Authority and the general enquiries functions of the Equality Tribunal, the Rights Commissioner Service and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>Since 3<sup>rd</sup> January 2012 all complaints related to employment issues should be channelled through this service, where they will be registered, acknowledged and referred to the National Employment Rights Authority or another relevant adjudication body.</p></reply>

There has been a steady growth in the number of families supported by FIS over recent years and associated expenditure as set in the table appended to this reply.  </p><p>  Expenditure on the FIS scheme is estimated to be &euro;281.7 million in 2014, up &euro;20 million on 2013.  The processing of applications for the FIS scheme is now totally up to date and delivering a fast and efficient service to lower-income working families.  The backlog in claim processing was reduced substantially in 2013 from nearly 11,000 at the start of the year to just over 2,500 at the end of the year.  All first-time claims and renewals are now processed promptly on receipt. </p><p>  The Department avails of every opportunity in its engagement with employers and jobseekers to build awareness of the availability of FIS and how this payment may benefit potential employees with children.  The increasing numbers of families in receipt of FIS is testament to the effectiveness of the Department's information strategy for the scheme and the significant improvements in customer service and processing times for FIS customers. </p><p>The Departments web site  has full information on the FIS scheme and provides typical family scenarios to aid understanding and provide comparisons.  This information is also available in all the Department local offices, CICs and information offices.  The Department is embarking shortly on a poster campaign in all of its local offices to further promote FIS. </p><p>  A series of road-shows have also been held around the country designed to inform employers about the wide range of employment support services provided by the Department, including FIS.  </p><p>  In addition, the Department launched a Benefit of Work ready reckoner in December last year.  The ready reckoner gives an indication of the difference between a person&rsquo;s potential in-work payment, including FIS, and current out-of-work payments.  </p><p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the FIS scheme is fulfilling its role in assisting employees to take up employment opportunities and to remain at work. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number in payment  (approx.) </th><th>Expenditure  (&euro; Millions) </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>28,875 </td><td>204.5</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32,310</td><td>223.6</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>44,160</td><td>261.5 (provisional) </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Over 26,000 placements have commenced to-date and over 6,500 jobseekers are currently participating in the scheme.  A recent independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns progress to paid employment after completing their internship.  The 61% progression rate for JobBridge is among the best in Europe, where progression rates for similar internship schemes average just 34%.  I am also very encouraged by the high rate of employment among participants who completed their internships in the public sector with 41% of these interns progressing into paid employment.</p><p>  The positive rates of progression into employment among public sector interns also show that the benefits of the development and experience that interns gain in public sector host organisations facilitates them in gaining employment.  In addition to the positive progression outcomes, interns found that they also benefited from an increase in their self-confidence, the opportunity to gain quality work experience and the opportunity to establish a network of contacts.  </p><p>  In relation to my own Department, since the inception of the JobBridge internship scheme, this Department has taken on 9 interns.  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a moratorium on employment in the Civil Service for a number of years.  Accordingly, it has not been possible for any JobBridge intern to gain full employment in my Department.</p><p>  In the letter of offer issued to interns, they were informed of the temporary nature of the internship, that it is not a civil service position and that it carries no entitlement to permanent appointment. Please find below a table indicating the number of interns by year and employment in my Department as requested. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of JobBridge Interns</th><th>Number that gained full employment in DSP</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>                   2</td><td>                                    Nil</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>                   2</td><td>                                    Nil</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>                   4</td><td>                                    Nil</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>                   1</td><td>                                    Nil</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The farm assist scheme is based on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  It was introduced in 1999 and farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  Recent changes to the scheme have brought it into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons.</p><p>  Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues can ask his/her local social welfare/Intreo office to review the level of means applying to their claim.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  In addition, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  </p><p>  As part of the normal budget process, all potential budget measures, including any changes to the farm assist scheme are assessed in terms of the impact they would have if introduced.  Since the introduction of the changes to the farm assist scheme over recent budgets, the scheme, is kept under ongoing review by my officials.  Last year I met with representatives from the Irish Farmers Association to discuss a number of issues including the farm assist scheme.  There are no plans to change the current scheme criteria.</p></reply>

In relation to the family referred to in the media, I do not propose to comment further on the details of this particular case other than to advise that the Department is engaging with them.  </p><p>  I assume that the Deputy is referring to media reports last week after the Dublin Region Homeless Executive presented 2013 figures to Dublin City Council, the detail of which has not been published.

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation. </p><p>  Rent supplement is not generally payable where a person or their spouse/partner is in full time employment, i.e. 30 hours or more per week.  However, since 2007, a person on rent supplement who is deemed by a local authority to be eligible to participate in the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) may engage in full-time employment, subject to satisfying the standard means test, and may still be paid rent supplement. </p><p>  The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.  In July 2013, the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) under which responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from this Department to local authorities.  Payments under the HAP scheme will be based on the local authority differential rent means test under which the full-time employment restriction does not apply and therefore will remove a key barrier to persons on social welfare in getting back to work.  </p><p>  Officials in the Department of Social Protection are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.  It is intended that the scheme will be piloted in Limerick local authority by end March 2014 with further roll out to selected local authorities during the year. </p></reply>

JobBridge is one of the key initiatives introduced to assist individuals to bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work.  To date over 26,000 jobseekers and some 12,000 companies have participated in the scheme. There are over 6,500 jobseekers currently participating.</p><p>  I have taken the view that, as participation as a host organisation is voluntary and as host organisations receive no payment from the State in relation to their participation in JobBridge, it is not necessary to publish their names.  In coming to this view I am informed by the very high progression to employment rates under the JobBridge scheme, which an independent evaluation by Indecon shows to be in excess of 60%, and am concerned that nothing should be done that might discourage companies from participating in the scheme.</p><p>  The scheme is not currently open to members of the Oireachtas to recruit interns to undertake an internship in their constituency offices nor is it open to political parties to recruit interns.  However, companies owned by members of the Oireachtas may participate in the scheme provided that the company is fully compliant with all scheme eligibility criteria.  The Department does not collect data in relation to the ownership of companies that host interns. </p><p>  Under the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan, the Department is developing a variant of the JobBridge scheme for the most disadvantaged young people.  The participation of clients, once referred by the Department, will be non-discretionary.  This is because:</p><p>  The variant scheme will see the Department dedicate extensive resources to the young jobseekers involved, and in the context of a guaranteed offer, the standard of mutual commitment must be higher.</p><p>  The approach to recruitment and candidate preparation will be tailored specifically to reflect the needs of these young people.</p></reply>

Budget 2014 extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. This measure aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities. Such rates in respect of younger jobseekers were first introduced in 2009.By extending the &euro;100 jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate to ages 22, 23 and 24 the changes provide that claimants in this age bracket will be &euro;60 better off if they engage in education or training as they will then receive &euro;160 per week. Persons aged 25, had previously been subject to no financial incentive measure, will now receive &euro;144 per week. These individuals will generally be &euro;16 better off if they engage in education or training as they will now receive &euro;160 per week.  The decision to reduce the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payable to young jobseekers was made on foot of on-going consideration of unemployment and activation policy by Government. The changes are not discriminatory but rather are targeted measures aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.</p><p>  I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment. If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.</p></reply>

Recently published ESRI research shows that transfers lifted almost 40 per cent of the population out of poverty in 2011, which equates to a reduction of 71 per cent in the pre-social transfer at-risk-of-poverty rate. As a result, Ireland is among the best performing countries in the EU in reducing poverty through social transfers. This reflects the continuation of substantial State investment in the social protection system, despite the challenges and constraints of the economic and fiscal crisis.</p><p>  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s school meals programme is a targeted intervention for children at risk of food poverty and educational disadvantage. The Department has provided &euro;37 million for the programme in 2014 which will benefit over 205,000 children across some 1,600 schools and organisations, for the academic year. In Budget 2014, I announced the provision of additional breakfast clubs to support school going children in disadvantaged areas.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-05a.75.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014030500071#WRE00300"><p>In the first instance, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  However, the Government also recognises the need for additional measures in the interim while the economy recovers.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathway to Work Strategy.  Pathways to Work 2013 prioritises the allocation of available resources to the long-term unemployed and to the young unemployed.  The goal in Strand 2 of Pathways to Work 2013 is: &ldquo;<i>To provide unemployed people, in particular people who are long-term unemployed and young unemployed people, with opportunities to enhance their job prospects through value-adding work experience, education and training activities</i>.&rdquo;   The Pathways to Work Strategy set a target of moving 20,000 of the 180,800 people who were on the Live Register for over a year (long-term unemployed) at the beginning of 2012, into employment by the end of 2013.  By the end of 2013, 26,611 of this group were known to have moved into employment.  Of these, 19,695 had entered full-time employment and left the Live Register, and 6,916 had entered part-time employment.  As there can be some time lag in the reporting of new entries to employment by the relevant employers, it is likely that these figures will increase retrospectively as further records become available. </p><p>  In terms of enhancing job prospects the Department has a number of supports available for jobseekers (including long term and young unemployed).  These provide short medium and long term places and are outlined below.  With specific reference to youth unemployment, during last year&rsquo;s EU Presidency, Ireland prioritised the provision of the EU recommendation on the provision of a Youth Guarantee under which every young person should be guaranteed an offer of employment, training or further education within a target period of four months of becoming unemployed.  Ireland also took the lead in discussions which led to the provision of a &euro;6bn EU spending provision which is to be frontloaded to cover programmes undertaken in the first two years of the multi-year financial framework (i.e. 2014 and 2015).  We have developed a national implementation plan for a Youth Guarantee in Ireland and this plan was forwarded to the European Commission at the beginning of this year and published in late January.</p><p>  - JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme) provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 month or a 9 month period.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  Some 6,400 people are currently participating on this scheme.  Over 13,000 new participants are expected to benefit from JobBridge in 2014.  Take-up of people under 25 is expected to exceed 3,000 this year (not including the new &ldquo;development&rdquo; JobBridge programme which is expected to increase this figure to 5,000).</p><p>  - The JobsPlus incentive scheme encourages employers to recruit long-term unemployed people.  The incentive is payable monthly in arrears, over a 2-year period.  There are 2 levels of incentive: &euro;7,500 for recruits unemployed for more than 12 but less than 24 months and &euro;10,000 for recruits unemployed for more than 24 months.  It is anticipated that approximately 4,000 jobs will be subsidised by JobsPlus in 2014 including an inflow of 2,000 new participants.  It is proposed to amend the eligibility requirements to allow young people to access the scheme at lower unemployment duration and as a result, young people are expected to account for approximately 1,500 of new participants on the JobsPlus scheme in 2014.</p><p>  - The Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community.  There were almost 31,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s in December 2013.  Similar figures are expected for 2014, with average participation expected to be in the order of 33,000.  In 2014, there will also be 3,000 places available on Gateway, a local authority labour activation scheme that provides short-term work and training opportunities for long-term unemployed people who have been on the Live Register for over 2 years.</p><p>  - In terms of up-skilling, the Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education.  In 2014, average participation is expected to be in the order of 18,500 of which circa 3,300 are expected to be accounted for by under 25s.</p><p>  - MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, was rolled out by the Department of Education in 2013.  MOMENTUM supports the provision of free education and training projects to allow up to 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,600 of these places have been taken up by young people in 2013 up to mid-November.  It is intended to provide a minimum of 2,000 MOMENTUM places for young people in 2014.</p><p>  - Two further up-skilling options available are the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;amp;D). Both PTEO and ET&amp;amp;D are designed to facilitate jobseekers who wish to engage in part time day, evening or weekend courses or more intensive short duration courses of education and training while retaining their jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  The PTEO allows participants to attend part-time day/evening or weekend courses of education or training and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists provided that they continue to satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment on an ongoing basis.  Payment is made at the same rate as the primary payment and no maximisation of payments occurs.  The ET&amp;amp;D allows participants to attend certain courses of education, training or development of short duration and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists.  Participants are exempt from engaging in job search but must be available for employment should an opportunity arise.</p><p>  - Courses delivered through Youthreach/CTCs are directed at unemployed young early school leavers aged 15-21.  They offer participants the opportunity to identify and pursue viable options within adult life, and provide them with opportunities for personal and social development education and training while pursuing nationally accredited qualifications.  Participation can last between one and two years.  Some 6,000 places will be provided in 2014, with an intake of about 3,300.  This will continue to be the main programme offer for school-leavers aged under 18 in the context of the Guarantee.</p><p>  - The former FAS training provision is being progressively transferred to the new regional Education and Training Boards (ETBs) up to mid-2014.  The main FAS/Solas programmes of relevance to the young unemployed are Specific Skills Training, Traineeships, Local Training Initiatives, and training for people with disabilities through Specialist Training Providers.  About 25,000 new participants are expected on these courses in 2014, of which 9,500 are expected to be young people.</p><p>  A breakdown of likely available places for 2014 is presented in the table below.

Recipient numbers have been in decline following a peak of over 97,000 in 2010.  Following an extensive review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas.  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has a minimum income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution of &euro;30 for a single person or &euro;40 for a couple.

While overall responsibility for the RSS rests with the Department, its day-to-day operations are delivered by 35 local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta (known as the Implementing Bodies).  The sum of &euro;45m has been allocated for the RSS in 2014, which will allow it to continue along the same lines as in previous years.  It does not, however, allow for recruitment above the numbers stated above and I have no plans to increase the current level of placements beyond those numbers.  </p><p>  Primary responsibility for determining works in relation to clean-up operations and remedial tasks resulting from recent storm damage rests with county councils.  I am confident that the Implementing Bodies will respond to providing whatever assistance is determined by county councils and/or other statutory agencies on weather related remedial work.  In addition to the RSS, implementing bodies have recourse to additional resources from T&uacute;s should such be required to support remedial works.  </p><p>  The Deputy should note that a new work placement initiative has been put in place by the Department with county and city councils.  Known as Gateway, it has been introduced to deliver on the policy objectives set out in Pathways to Work and is designed to bridge the gap between unemployment and re-entering the workforce.  Responsibility for delivery of this initiative rests with individual county and city councils.  Gateway has a target to provide for 3,000 placements focusing on those who have been unemployed for 24 months or more.  As responsibility for the majority of environmental works falls within the remit of these city and county councils, Gateway will present the councils with an opportunity to deploy this workforce to remedy storm damage and provide assistance with local clean-up projects.</p><p>  Rates of payment on the RSS are set with reference to participants&rsquo; underlying rates of payment on their qualifying social welfare allowance and are consistent with the level of payments on community employment, T&uacute;s and Gateway.  Participants are paid the equivalent of their prior social welfare payment plus &euro;20 per week subject to a minimum weekly payment of &euro;208 per week. </p></reply>

I think this is only right, given the importance of the network to the social fabric of our society. </p><p>  In this regard, I am very happy to provide my own support for the post office network and the valuable work being delivered by postmasters throughout the country.  On the 20th December last year, I was very pleased to be able to sign a new contract with An Post for over-the-counter cash services for welfare clients following an EU-wide procurement competition.  The contract, which is for a minimum period of 2 years with the option to extend to a maximum of 6 years, is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  Therefore, I am happy to be able to confirm that these services will continue for large numbers of welfare clients into the future, as provided for under the terms of the contract.</p><p>  The continuation of over-the-counter cash payment services supports some nine hundred thousand (900,000) customers currently.  These services are provided through a network of over 1,300 post offices and agencies around the country, the larger number of which are run as vibrant commercial retail outlets and operations by individual postmasters and their staff.  </p><p>  Last year approximately &euro;9.5 billion was paid in cash to our clients at post offices.  This accounted for 43.7 million transactions and cost the Department just under &euro;75 million (including internal processing costs).  By comparison, some 37 million payments were issued directly into accounts in financial institutions by electronic funds transfer (EFT) and this cost the Department under &euro;9 million.  In short, cash payments are an inherently more expensive means of paying clients.  It costs the Department 6.5 times more to issue a payment to a customer in cash than it does by EFT.  The Department must address such a significant variation in costs in the interests of the economy, taxpayers and welfare clients. </p><p>  Mindful of the scope, scale and impact of these payments, the Department undertook a root and branch examination of its payment processes, methods and approaches.  This resulted in the preparation of a payment strategy which was approved by the Government last year.  The strategy has the goal of reducing significantly the level at which welfare payments are made in cash and thereby minimising the associated expensive fees.  These fees are expensive because they reflect the additional costs incurred for securely packing, processing, transporting, delivering and issuing cash to clients.  The same level of fees is not incurred on electronic payment transactions.  Furthermore, cash limits the options for customers to make onward transactions.  It limits the scope for customers to avail of cheaper prices online and curtails financial inclusion of customers.  It is also at odds with trends in consumer behaviour generally as they migrate towards electronic payment channels.</p><p>  Concerning statements that the Department is actively seeking to prevent clients from receiving their payment in cash, a number of representations have been received alleging that the Department is orchestrating activities to discourage or prevent clients from receiving payments at their post office.  These statements are not correct.  The Deputy may be referring to recent communications from departmental officials to job-seeking clients aged 62-64 years.  </p><p>  Up until Budget 2014, older jobseekers were required, as part of their entitlement to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, to be available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work.  In addition, they like other jobseekers were required to comply, when requested to so do, with the Department&rsquo;s activation measures.  Legislation provided that non-compliance with such activation measures, without good cause, would give rise to the imposition of penalties in the form of payment reductions.  Revised conditions were announced as part of Budget 2014 to apply to older persons who seek the support of jobseekers schemes in advance of reaching pension age.  The measures provide for these clients to continue to avail of departmental supports on a voluntary basis should they wish to return to work, training or education.  In addition, provision is made for these clients to receive their payments directly into an account in a financial institution if they so wish.  Some communications have been received by some older clients from local offices of the Department advising them of these budgetary changes.  Those letters also reference the option of being paid electronically.  The letter neither prevents nor discourages these clients from receiving their payments in the post office but rather it simply informs them of the option to change their payment method.  If and when An Post can provide an electronic payment channel the Department will happily facilitate clients&rsquo; instructions to pay funds directly into such an account. </p><p>  The move to digital transactions is in line with wider Government policies and objectives on better public services and more effective electronic payments as set out in the public service reform plan and the eGovernment strategy 2012-2015.  The goal is also shared by the national payments plan and the roll-out of the standard bank account.  These initiatives have made the case quite strongly for a move to electronic payments which will contribute to improved national competitiveness.</p><p>  Clearly the trend is towards electronic payments as a matter of choice.  The Department&rsquo;s clients are already displaying a clear disposition towards electronic payments as a matter of choice without intervention by the Department.   The recent letters to clients alerting them to an easing of conditions during their transitional period from employment reflect these realities and offer wider options to these clients. </p></reply>

The allocation of additional resources to the activation of long term unemployed people was the focus of an updated &ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo; policy statement published in July 2013 (PTW 2013).  The Department examined various resourcing and contracting options, and taking note of recommendations by the OECD among others, the Department has decided to procure additional capacity from providers with expertise and experience in the provision of employment supports or related services.   This additional capacity will augment the Department&rsquo;s own activation capacity as well as that already contracted through Local Employment Services (LES) providers.  It is not intended that it will substitute for or replace any of the services currently offered by the Department.  In this regard the Department has maintained the budget for LES services for 2014 at the same level as 2013 and intends to operate the LES services, which are a valued component of its services to jobseekers, in parallel with JobPath.  On the 12th of December 2013 a request for tenders (RFT) for the provision of the service was issued with a closing date for receipt of submissions of the 28th February 2014.  Given the requirements of EU and National procurement regulations the Department will not disclose any details in relations to the tenders received while the procurement process is ongoing.  </p></reply>

Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  Typically over 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years.  People who were previously self-employed and are now in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available to other job-seeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients.    </p><p>  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to unemployed people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.   </p><p>  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.    </p><p>  Furthermore, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through Skillnets or ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  </p><p>  Springboard courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.  </p><p>  The Work Placement Programme is also open to persons not in receipt of a social welfare payment, although the participant will not receive a payment while on the programme. </p><p>  With reference to qualified adults, the qualified adult dependent of a person who has an existing entitlement to the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) can qualify for BTEA in their own right for the duration of an approved course of study.  This provision applies to all BTEA relevant social welfare payments where there is an increase in respect of a qualified adult dependent in payment. </p><p>  To qualify under this option, the applicant must be a qualified adult dependent (for the required qualifying period i.e. 3 months for SLO, 9 months for TLO (2 years in case of IB recipients)) of a person who satisfies the eligibility criteria for participation in the BTEA scheme immediately prior to the commencement of the approved course of study.</p><p>  The qualified adult dependent, in such cases, is entitled to the increased qualified adult rate of the relevant Social Welfare payment that the claimant is in receipt of.  </p><p>  In effect, this provision allows the Social Welfare claimant and his/her qualified adult dependent to qualify independently for participation in the Back to Education Allowance Scheme.</p><p>  The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) has a spousal swap facility.  Where a person partaking in the BTWEA ceases self-employment before exhausting entitlement, their qualified adult may avail of entitlement under the scheme for the duration remaining on the original claim.  </p><p>  Qualified adults are also eligible for the Rural Social Scheme (RSS), which is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen/women through spousal swaps.  If a person eligible for the RSS does not wish to participate on the RSS, his/her dependent spouse/civil partner/cohabitant can apply in their place.  In these instances, the person originally qualified must give up his/her qualifying DSP payment if his/her spouse/civil partner/cohabitant is accepted on the RSS.</p></reply>

Where a person is in receipt of a reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance and he or she participates in a course of education, training a higher rate of &euro;160 applies.    Similar issues to the ones raised by the organisation concerned have been raised previously by Focus Ireland.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  The revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.  </p><p>  The USC is an annual tax payable on an individual's total income (including rental income) in a year, subject to a number of exemptions and reliefs.  In particular, an individual is not liable to pay USC where his or her total income in the tax year does not exceed &euro;10,036.  In addition, individuals aged 70 and over benefit from a lower rate of USC provided their total income does not exceed &euro;60,000.</p><p>  Where an individual is a chargeable person for income tax purposes, that individual's income is also liable to PRSI.  This includes income arising in respect of letting property.  The question of benefits arising from PRSI payments are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that gross rents received by landlords can be reduced by the specified deductions set out in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This includes interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year).</p><p>  The 75% restriction on interest, which applies to residential property, was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget as part of a revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances.  </p><p>  With regard to a property in negative equity, where an investor incurs an actual loss in disposing of an asset, the loss can be set against other capital gains in computing any capital gains tax payable by the individual.</p><p>  As you may be aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by the Department of Finance in the lead up to Budget 2012.

The sales process plan and timeline for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio has been developed following professional advice and in light of requirements for a robust and credible sales process in that context. Neither I nor my officials had any role in the development of the sales process plan for the residential mortgage book. </p><p>  The Special Liquidators have given significant consideration to and have sought independent advice from PWC in relation to how the residential mortgage portfolio is to be dealt with. Following that independent advice, the Special Liquidators have decided that the residential mortgage book would be sold in portfolios with a view to maximising market interest and return within the timelines set out in the Ministerial Instructions.</p><p>  I am advised that it is for this reason that the Special Liquidators have decided not to accept any bids from individual mortgage holders, however mortgage holders are permitted to buy out their mortgage at par value and that there are no legislative barriers for such Borrowers to do so.</p><p>  In relation to the loss of protections under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), I have instructed my Department to examine the issue, in consultation with the Central Bank, with a view to bringing forward a solution, if required.

This is an important and timely development and will ensure that mortgage holders in arrears will be serviced in line with the CCMA and the customers will continue to be protected by the code in the event that they acquire these loans.</p></reply>

In this regard, in Budget 2012, the Minister fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period. This was the period during which house prices peaked.</p><p>  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period. In addition, the increased rate of tax relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year. </p><p>  The arrangements and qualifying conditions for mortgage interest relief are publicised widely whenever changes to the system are made in the Budget and are published on the Revenue website.</p><p>  It would be inappropriate for me to become involved in speculation on this matter so far in advance of the Budget, which is over seven months away. </p></reply>

SOLAS has put several measures in place to assist redundant apprentices to complete their apprenticeship where necessary.  Redundant apprentices may avail of existing skills training courses which enhance their skills.  They may also avail of the range of night courses which are available in Training Centres.</p><p>  SOLAS has also introduced a Competency Determination Mechanism.  This mechanism provides redundant apprentices who meet the qualifying criteria with the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and knowledge against the occupational standard for specified trade over a number of days in a Training Centre.  Further details are available from the relevant SOLAS Training Adviser/ETB Training Adviser.</p><p>  Under the Action Plan for Jobs initiative a review of the Irish Apprenticeship system commenced in 2013 to determine whether the current model of apprenticeship should be retained, adapted or replaced, taking into account the needs of learners, employers, the economy and the need for cost effectiveness into the future.  The Apprenticeship Review Group's report was submitted in December 2013 to the Department of Education and Skills.  The group made recommendations both with regard to the expansion of apprenticeship into new industrial sectors as well as to the existing apprenticeship trades.  Discussions are under way with relevant stakeholders on implementation arrangements.</p></reply>

The Deputy should note that that the figures in the accompanying table for printing expenditure represent the total cost of printing for these years as it is not possible to identify the costs of Irish language printing separately. <table><tr><th><font face="Calibri"> -</font></th><th><font face="Calibri"> </font></th><th><b><font face="Calibri">ADVERTISING</font></b></th></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">YEAR</font></td><td><b><font face="Calibri">ADVERTISING IN IRISH</font></b></td><td><b><font face="Calibri">ALL ADVERTISING</font></b></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2011</font></td><td><b><i><font face="Calibri">*</font></i></b></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;95,000</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2012</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">*</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;107,000</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2013</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;92,285</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;294,507</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri"> </font></td><td><font face="Calibri">*  No break down available for Irish Advertising</font></td><td><b><font face="Calibri">&euro;496,507</font></b></td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th><font face="Calibri">YEAR</font></th><th><font face="Calibri"> -</font></th><th><b><font face="Calibri">TRANSLATION</font></b></th></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2011</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">translation to or from Irish</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;147,267</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2012</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">translation to or from Irish</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;89,560</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2013</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">translation to or from Irish</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;107,521</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri"> </font></td><td><font face="Calibri"> </font></td><td><b><font face="Calibri">&euro;344,348</font></b></td></tr></table><table><tr><th><font face="Calibri">-</font></th><th><font face="Calibri">-</font></th><th><b><font face="Calibri">PRINTING</font></b></th></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">YEAR</font></td><td><b><font face="Calibri">PRINTING IN IRISH</font></b></td><td><b><font face="Calibri">ALL PRINTING</font></b></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2011</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">*</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;401,480</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2012</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">*</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;148,849</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2013</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">*</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">&euro;157,320</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">-</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">*No break down available for printing in Irish </font></td><td><b><font face="Calibri">&euro;707,648</font></b></td></tr></table><table><tr><th><font face="Calibri">YEAR</font></th><th><font face="Calibri"> </font></th><th><b><font face="Calibri">SIGNAGE</font></b></th></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2011</font></td><td><font face="Calibri"> </font></td><td><font face="Calibri">NIL</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2012</font></td><td><font face="Calibri"> </font></td><td><font face="Calibri">NIL</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Calibri">2013</font></td><td><font face="Calibri">Signage for the Department's Offices in  Dublin, Athlone &amp;amp; Tullamore </font></td><td><b><font face="Calibri">&euro;8,377</font></b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme. </p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years and I am aware of the difficulties faced by schools in relation to these schemes.  Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents. </p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.</p><p>  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget.  Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to  make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved. </p><p>The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a  book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.</p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental/loan scheme and will not therefore qualify for funding.</p></reply>

Measures have been taken by the Department and the Teaching Council to alleviate difficulties faced by teachers in this regard.</p><p>  One measure relates to the minimum service requirement for probation purposes to secure registration with the Teaching Council as a primary teacher being decreased from 170 days to 100 days in the 2011-12 school year.  In addition, if an applicant is unable to complete the requirements of a registration condition within the specified period, he or she may apply to the Council for an extension to that period.</p><p>  In addition, under circular 46/2011 the Department allowed schools and ETBs to participate in the National Internship Scheme, JobBridge, administered by the Department of Social Protection.  JobBridge can provide valuable teaching experience to teachers and assist them in securing employment subsequently.  A  JobBridge internship may allow a newly qualified teacher to undergo the  probation process required to become fully registered.</p><p>  If a teacher is unable to complete the probation requirements within the specified period, he or she may apply to the Council for an extension.  Each application is considered on its merits taking account of the stage reached by the applicant in meeting the requirements.  Teaching resources are allocated to schools on a school year basis.  Unlike most other areas of the public service teaching vacancies are being filled in accordance with published Department criteria.  The Government has prioritised, as best as possible, the filling of front-line posts in the Education sector  within the constraints of the Employment Control Framework.  For example, schools are permitted to fill teaching vacancies that arise within their approved staffing allocations.  The redeployment of surplus permanent teachers is the first mechanism to fill teaching posts in schools.  This is key to the ability of my Department to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.  Thereafter, teaching posts are filled in the normal manner through the recruitment process at individual school level.</p></reply>

For works contracts the current threshold is &euro;5.186 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the current threshold is &euro;134,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the current threshold is &euro;207,000. The current threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000. The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p><p>  I understand that approximately two thirds of tenders which are above these EU thresholds have contract award notices published for them. The reason for this level of publication is that of the remaining tenders some may never be awarded or the tender competition may be cancelled. It is the responsibility of individual contracting authorities to publish award notices following the signing of a contract. This process is facilitated through the national eProcurement portal .</p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. The most recent data available on above EU threshold awards relates to 2011 and is as follows: Approximately 10% (valued at &euro;240M) of the contracts awarded above EU thresholds in this State went to non-domestic companies. This represents less than 5% of the overall annual public procurement spend (approximately &euro;13.1 billion). </p><p>  Whilst contracting Authorities are not required to publish the results of tender competitions, under EU thresholds, they are required to advertise all procurement opportunities above &euro;25,000 for supplies and services and &euro;50,000 for works on . Furthermore, guidance (Guidelines for a Competitive Process) issued by my Department to contracting authorities outlines best practice in relation to informing tenders of the outcome of each procurement process. This states that contracting authorities should provide unsuccessful tenderers with as much useful feedback as possible to enable them to have a better footing in future competitive processes.</p></reply>

This was the fifth quarter in succession where employment has grown year-on-year.</p><p>  There are now 1.909 million people at work, compared to 1.847 million at the start of the Action Plan for Jobs process.  We are now creating jobs faster than any other economy in the EU or the OECD, at a rate of 4.5% per annum in the private sector.</p><p>  In the final Quarter of 2013, employment increased in 10 of the 14 economic sectors, including Agriculture, Tourism, Professional and Scientific activities &ndash; all areas of focus for the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>  These figures suggest that we are seeing sustained progress in our efforts to support employment creation through the Action Plan for Jobs.  However, with our unemployment rate still above the EU average at 12.1%, we cannot afford to be complacent.  We must continue the process of improving our competitiveness and helping companies to start up, grow and create more jobs.</p><p>  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs was published by the Government on 27th February and builds on the 2012 and 2013 Action Plans.  This year&rsquo;s Plan includes targets for the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the new Local Enterprise Offices to support a total of 30,500 direct new jobs during 2014.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 new full-time permanent jobs and target &euro;17.5 billion in exports by client companies in 2014.</p><p>  IDA Ireland will also target 13,000 new gross jobs in 2014 and work to win another 155 new FDI investment projects, with 20% of those from growth markets.  In addition, a further 10,000 jobs (6,000 direct and 4,000 indirect) will be created over a five year period through the recruitment of extra staff for IDA overseas.  </p><p>  The work of the enterprise agencies will be supplemented by our efforts, under the Action Plan, to support the recovery of the domestic economy in areas such as Construction, Retail and Tourism, where there is potential for significant jobs growth as the economy recovers.</p></reply>

The CEBs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level.  They are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand their business. Contact details for the CEBs are available on . </p><p>  The CEBs generally only grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or Internationally Traded Services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio.  Retail enterprises are ineligible for direct financial support from the CEBs due to concerns over displacement (where grant-assisted projects simply displace business from other players in the local market).  It should be noted that Enterprise Ireland is also legally precluded under its remit from providing direct financial assistance to retail enterprises. </p><p>  Any start-up can also use the CEBs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.  Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB.</p><p>  In addition, locally trading businesses, including start-ups can avail of non-financial assistance from their CEB in the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc. Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business, taxation for beginners, internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the system for delivery of State supports to micro and small enterprises is being reformed and that the 35 existing County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will be dissolved and new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will be created.  This reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and economic recovery and growth.  The target date for the legal dissolution of the CEBs and the formal launch of the LEOs is mid-April, 2014.</p><p>  The Quarterly National Household Survey, Quarter 3 2013 employment figure showed continued growth in the Accommodation and Food Service Activities sector which now employs almost 138,000 people.  The Republic of Ireland attracted almost 7 million overseas visits in 2013, an increase of 7.2% compared to 2012.  This continued strong performance was aided by the Government&rsquo;s decision in 2011 to introduce a temporary reduced VAT rate of 9% for tourist-related services.  The introduction of the 9% VAT rate has helped to create and retain jobs in the Accommodation and Food Service sector where employment has increased by 16,600 between Quarter 3 2011 and Quarter 3 2013.  While the 9% rate was due to expire in December 2013, Budget 2014 confirmed the retention of the 9% rate for hotel and catering services.</p></reply>

In 2011, as part of the Jobs Initiative the Government reduced the VAT rate to 9% for those in the Tourism and Hospitality sectors to boost economic growth and cost competitiveness.

The 4.25% employer PRSI rate reverted to the original 8.5% rate from 1 January 2014. </p><p>  As the reversion of the employer rate to 8.5% is provided for in legislation, it has already been built into the PRSI income base for 2014 and subsequent years.  Re-introducing the 4.25% rate of employer PRSI in 2014 would reduce the expected PRSI yield to the Social Insurance Fund by &euro;195 million in a full year.  Such a re-introduction could only be considered in a Budgetary context.</p><p>  Issues associated with the creation of employment opportunities are for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the first instance.  However, as part of the overall Government approach to unemployment, the Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  These measures include the back to education allowance scheme, T&uacute;s, JobBridge - the national internship scheme, the jobseeker's benefit and allowance schemes as they relate to casual and part-time workers and the part-time job incentive scheme.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, there is special provision under CE to address the social and learning needs of persons emerging from drug mis-use in order to support them on their journey of rehabilitation.</p><p>  I recommended that this Group be put in place to act in a consultative and advisory capacity to the Department on these matters.  The first meeting of the Group was held on 4 April 2013.   Membership of the Group is drawn from representatives nominated by the following key stakeholders:</p><p>-  Health Service Executive (1)</p><p>-  Department of Health - Drugs Policy Unit (1)</p><p>-  National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee (1)</p><p>-  City of Dublin VEC (1)</p><p>-  Community Sector (1)</p><p>-  Voluntary Sector (1)</p><p>-  Regional Drugs Task Forces (1)</p><p>-  Local Drugs Task Forces (1)</p><p>-  Community Employment Scheme (1)</p><p>As well as the 9 representatives outlined above, there are two Departmental officials on the Group and the secretariat function is also provided by the Department. </p><p>  The Advisory Group meets on a quarterly basis and since its establishment progress has been made in a number of areas in ensuring the sustainability and development of the drug rehabilitation strand on CE.  One of the main benefits of the Group is the opportunity it gives to share information, raise concerns and share views on how the programme is operating and to explore areas for improvement.</p><p>  The promotion of CE as a resource available to participants emerging from drug-misuse is a key issue for the Group.  To date the following measures have been put in place:</p><p>-  An improved vacancy notification system for places for drug rehabilitation is now in place and has been advised to all scheme sponsors;</p><p>-  A CE Drugs Referral process has been introduced to ensure appropriate referrals to the rehabilitation places.  The referral protocol was developed in consultation with representatives of the Advisory Group and the National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee;</p><p>-  Information sharing with Treatment Centres and other referral points in the drug rehabilitation process is a key priority and one in which the Advisory Group have a key role;</p><p>-  A point of reference for the Group is the provision by the Department of data on participation rates, profile of persons on the special CE strand and outcomes achieved on the programme;</p><p>-  A key issue for the Group is how to ensure that a multi-agency approach is present and continues to be made available to participants should they need it while on CE e.g. counselling and back-up treatment supports.</p><p>  Priority of drugs rehabilitation referral places was included in the application of the additional 2,000 CE places provided by the Department in the 2013 budget.  Overall 29 additional drug rehabilitation places have been allocated, in addition to this one innovative Drug Project has been approved (Kildare Addiction Services, with 21 places).  Training and development of CE participants on rehabilitation schemes now form the core function of activities provided.</p><p>  The provision of guidance and information to Department staff who oversee these projects in terms of the needs and challenges was identified within this forum.  In this context, it should be noted that:</p><p>-  In July 2013, a drugs awareness workshop was held for Department staff who are working with schemes with drug rehabilitation places.  The workshop was delivered by key stakeholders from the statutory and community sectors involved in the Advisory Group and included presentations from scheme participants.</p><p>-  This was followed up by a workshop for CE Supervisors who work on mainstream projects to heighten their awareness of the needs of the client group.  </p><p>Feedback from both workshops was very positive and the Department will continue to engage with staff and CE Schemes in this way. </p><p>  I would like to invite the Deputy to meet with officials in the Department at her convenience to discuss this work in more detail and also address any other issues of concern to her.</p></reply>

Up until Budget 2014, older jobseekers were required, as part of their entitlement to a jobseeker's payment, to comply with the Department's activation measures when requested to so do, as is the case with other jobseekers.  Legislation provides that non-compliance with such activation measures, without good cause, could give rise to the imposition of penalties in the form of payment reductions.  </p><p>  Revised arrangements were announced as part of Budget 2014 to apply to older persons who seek the support of jobseekers schemes in advance of reaching pension age.  The measures provide for these clients to continue to avail of Departmental supports on a voluntary basis should they wish to return to work, training or education.  In addition, provision is made for these clients to receive their payments directly into an account in a financial institution if they so wish.  A letter issued to older jobseeker customers advising them of these changes.  It is important to note, however, that this letter neither prevented nor discouraged these clients from receiving their payments in the post office.  It simply informed them of the option to change their payment method if they chose to do so.  </p><p>  In the main, the majority of jobseeker payments are paid through the post-offices.  If and when An Post can provide an electronic payment channel, the Department will also happily facilitate clients' instructions to pay funds directly into such an account.  If the Deputy has any other specific case in mind and she wishes to forward the details, I will of course have my officials examine the circumstances.</p></reply>

These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp;amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  </p><p>However, the Government also recognises the need for additional measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy. <i>Pathways to Work 2013</i> prioritises the allocation of available resources <i>inter alia </i>to the young unemployed. The goal in Strand 2 of Pathways to Work 2013 is: &ldquo;<i>To provide unemployed people, in particular people who are long-term unemployed and young unemployed people, with opportunities to enhance their job prospects through value-adding work experience, education and training activities</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>  In terms of enhancing job prospects the Department has a number of supports available for jobseekers (including young unemployed). These provide short medium and long term places and are outlined below. With specific reference to youth unemployment, during last year&rsquo;s EU Presidency, Ireland prioritised the passing of the EU recommendation on the provision of a Youth Guarantee under which every young person should be guaranteed an offer of employment, training or further education within a target period of four months of becoming unemployed. Ireland also took the lead in discussions which led to the provision of a &euro;6bn EU spending provision which is to be frontloaded to cover programmes undertaken in the first two years of the multi-year financial framework (i.e. 2014 and 2015). We have developed a national implementation plan for a Youth Guarantee in Ireland and this plan was forwarded to the European Commission at the beginning of this year and published in late January. A range of specific measures is included in the plan:-</p><p>  - JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme) provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 month or a 9 month period.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  Some 6,400 people are currently participating on this scheme. Over 13,000 new participants are expected to benefit from JobBridge in 2014. Take-up of people under 25 is expected to exceed 3,000 this year (not including the new &ldquo;development&rdquo; JobBridge programme which is expected to increase this figure to 5,000).</p><p>  - The JobsPlus incentive scheme encourages employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. The incentive is payable monthly in arrears, over a 2-year period. There are 2 levels of incentive: &euro;7,500 for recruits unemployed for more than 12 but less than 24 months and &euro;10,000 for recruits unemployed for more than 24 months.  It is anticipated that approximately 4,000 jobs will be subsidised by JobsPlus in 2014 including an inflow of 2,000 new participants. It is proposed to amend the eligibility requirements to allow young people to access the scheme at lower unemployment duration and as a result, young people are expected to account for approximately 1,500 of new participants on the JobsPlus scheme in 2014.</p><p>  - The Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community. There were almost 31,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s in December 2013. Similar figures are expected for 2014, with average participation expected to be in the order of 33,000.  In 2014, there will also be 3,000 places available on Gateway, a local authority labour activation scheme that provides short-term work and training opportunities for long-term unemployed people who have been on the Live Register for over 2 years.</p><p>  - In terms of up-skilling, the Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. In 2014, average participation is expected to be in the order of 18,500 of which circa 3,300 are expected to be accounted for by under 25s.</p><p>  - MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, was rolled out by the Department of Education in 2013. MOMENTUM supports the provision of free education and training projects to allow up to 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors. Over 1,600 of these places have been taken up by young people in 2013 up to mid-November. It is intended to provide a minimum of 2,000 MOMENTUM places for young people in 2014.</p><p>  - Two further up-skilling options available are the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;amp;D). Both PTEO and ET&amp;amp;D are designed to facilitate jobseekers who wish to engage in part time day, evening or weekend courses or more intensive short duration courses of education and training while retaining their jobseeker&rsquo;s payments. The PTEO allows participants to attend part-time day/evening or weekend courses of education or training and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists provided that they continue to satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment on an on-going basis. Payment is made at the same rate as the primary payment and no maximisation of payments occurs. The ET&amp;amp;D allows participants to attend certain courses of education, training or development of short duration and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists. Participants are exempt from engaging in job search but must be available for employment should an opportunity arise.</p><p>  - Courses delivered through Youthreach/CTCs are directed at unemployed young early school leavers aged 15-21. They offer participants the opportunity to identify and pursue viable options within adult life, and provide them with opportunities for personal and social development education and training while pursuing nationally accredited qualifications. Participation can last between one and two years. Some 6,000 places will be provided in 2014, with an intake of about 3,300. This will continue to be the main programme offer for school-leavers aged under 18 in the context of the Guarantee.</p><p>  -  The former FAS training provision is being progressively transferred to the new regional Education and Training Boards (ETBs) up to mid-2014. The main FAS/Solas programmes of relevance to the young unemployed are Specific Skills Training, Traineeships, Local Training Initiatives, and training for people with disabilities through Specialist Training Providers. About 25,000 new participants are expected on these courses in 2014, of which 9,500 are expected to be young people.</p><p>  A breakdown of likely available places for 2014 is presented in the table.</p><p><b>Expected participation, activation programmes, 2014</b><table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Average participation</th><th>Inflow of new participants</th><th>Expected inflow<br /><br /> of young people</th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td>6,000</td><td>3,300</td><td>3,300</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including planned reserve)</td><td>7,700</td><td>13,300</td><td>5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Tus</td><td>7,500</td><td>7,500</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td>4,000</td><td>2,000</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>6,500</td><td>6,500</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>18,500</td><td>9,300</td><td>3,300</td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>11,000</td><td>5,500</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>5,600</td><td>2,800</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td>10,300</td><td>25,000</td><td>9,500</td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports</td><td></td><td>700</td><td>700</td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td></td><td>150</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>250</td><td>250</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>3,000</td><td>3,000</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>25,300</td><td>12,700</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>105,650</td><td>92,000</td><td>28,350</td></tr><tr><td>PLCs<br /><br />Apprenticeship</td><td>35,000<br /><br />8,000</td><td>32,000<br /><br />2,500</td><td>22,000<br /><br />2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Vocational Third Level</td><td>-</td><td>It is estimated that at least 50% of the 41,000 entrants to third level each year are entering courses leading towards defined occupations</td><td>-</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  </p><p>However, the Government also recognises the need for additional measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy. <i>Pathways to Work 2013</i> prioritises the allocation of available resources to the long-term unemployed. The goal in Strand 2 of Pathways to Work 2013 is: &ldquo;<i>To provide unemployed people, in particular people who are long-term unemployed and young unemployed people, with opportunities to enhance their job prospects through value-adding work experience, education and training activities</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>  The Pathways to Work Strategy set a target of moving 75,000 of the 180,800 people who were on the Live Register for over a year (long-term unemployed) at the beginning of 2012, into employment by the end of 2015. By the end of 2013, some 42,900 of this group had moved into employment, 12,000 of whom, to part-time employment. As there can be some time lag in the reporting of new entries to employment by the relevant employers, it is likely that these figures will increase retrospectively as further records become available. </p><p>  In terms of enhancing job prospects the Department has a number of supports available for jobseekers (including long term). These provide short medium and long term places and are outlined below.</p><p>  - JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme) provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 month or a 9 month period.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  Some 6,400 people are currently participating on this scheme. Over 13,000 new participants are expected to benefit from JobBridge in 2014.</p><p>  - The JobsPlus incentive scheme encourages employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. The incentive is payable monthly in arrears, over a 2-year period. There are 2 levels of incentive: &euro;7,500 for recruits unemployed for more than 12 but less than 24 months and &euro;10,000 for recruits unemployed for more than 24 months.  It is anticipated that approximately 4,000 jobs will be subsidised by JobsPlus in 2014 including an inflow of 2,000 new participants.</p><p>  - The Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community.

In the case of disability allowance appeals, the average processing time for an oral hearing reduced from 51.1 weeks in 2010 to 36.2 weeks in 2013.  Illness benefit appeals which required an oral hearing took an average of 56.4 weeks in 2010 reducing to 43.3 weeks in 2013.  A similar trend was reflected in the areas of invalidity pension (down from 59.7 weeks in 2010 to 42.5 weeks in 2013); carer&rsquo;s allowance (down from 47.3 weeks in 2010 to 33.5 weeks in 2013); carer&rsquo;s benefit (down from 44.2 weeks in 2010 to 27.4 weeks in 2013); and domiciliary care allowance (down from 49.1 weeks in 2010 to 34.4 weeks in 2013).</p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer and further investigation or medical examination, if deemed necessary.  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals. It is anticipated that with these improvements, the processing times for appeals will continue to improve throughout 2014.</p><p><b>Processing times for Disability Allowance Appeals 2010-2013</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>30.8</td><td>51.1</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>27.4</td><td>55.6</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>34.2</td><td>40.6</td></tr><tr><td>2013   </td><td>29.0</td><td>36.2</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Processing times for Illness Benefit Appeals 2010-2013 </b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>39.2</td><td>56.4</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>38.2</td><td>59.8</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>41.9</td><td>50.3</td></tr><tr><td>2013   </td><td>37.4</td><td>43.3</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Processing times for Invalidity Pension Appeals 2010-2013</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>40.0</td><td>59.7</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>36.4</td><td>58.9</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>38.8</td><td>48.7</td></tr><tr><td>2013   </td><td>35.0</td><td>42.5</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Processing times for Carers Allowance Appeals 2010-2013</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>26.9</td><td>47.3</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>31.3</td><td>57.9</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>33.5</td><td>42.5</td></tr><tr><td>2013   </td><td>27.9</td><td>33.5</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Processing times for Carers Benefit Appeals 2010-2013</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>21.6</td><td>44.2</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>21.8</td><td>59.4</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>27.3</td><td>35.3</td></tr><tr><td>2013   </td><td>22.5</td><td>27.4</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Processing times for Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals 2010-2013</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing <br /><br />times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>26.8</td><td>49.1</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>25.4</td><td>55.8</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32.5</td><td>41.4</td></tr><tr><td>2013   </td><td>27.6</td><td>34.4</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.  In July 2013, the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) under which responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from this Department to local authorities.

A self-employed person may apply for jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or their income reduces to a low level due a lack of demand for services.  Jobseekers allowance is a means tested payment and income from self-employment activity is assessed by reference to the estimated net profit from the business concerned over the coming 12 months.  It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in income and activity levels is reflected in any assessment of means from self-employment.</p><p>  Where it is not possible to estimate income for the coming 12 months, the income for the most recent 12 month period is generally taken as a guide, allowing for any known changes in circumstances which are likely to have a significant effect on income.  Accordingly, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.  For example, if a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a substitute contract in the coming year, this would be factored into the estimate of future income.  In addition to those whose self-employment has ceased, there are over 11,000 people currently in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment who are also classified as self-employed, although the current level of engagement in business would vary greatly among this group.</p></reply>

The Department makes every effort to ensure that the correct payment is made to the correct customer at the correct time and has measures in place to help ensure that this occurs including ongoing reviews of claims, staff training, detailed scheme guidelines, explanatory circulars and investigation of entitlement by the inspectorate.  When a jobseeker&rsquo;s claim is awarded, or if entitlement has changed following review, details of the decision are notified to the customer setting out the revised decision, the amount payable (where applicable) and how that amount is calculated.  This information includes a breakdown of any means assessment. While this detail helps the customer understand their payment, it can also assist in highlighting any errors in the calculation.</p><p>  Claims are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that customers continue to receive their correct entitlement.  However, not all reviews are initiated by the Department as a customer can request a review of entitlement at any time.  The Department strives at all times to ensure that people are paid their correct entitlement and to amend that payment in a timely fashion where entitlement changes, such as where a customer notifies a relevant change in his/her circumstances.  If the Deputy has a specific case in mind and he wishes to forward the details, I will arrange to have it examined by the Department.</p></reply>

The Department of Social Protection keeps a detailed breakdown of the profiles of jobseekers.  Data on each client&rsquo;s age, past occupation, and his/her education, is collected at the point of registration for job-seekers&rsquo; payment; these and other relevant data are processed and the probability of exiting the live register is calculated (PEX).  This is essentially a predictor of whether or not someone will become long-term unemployed.  The roll-out of the profiling system at the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices implicitly involves age profiling of the long-term unemployed, as age is one of the main determining variables in predicting if someone will become long-term unemployed.  In other words, if someone is in an age category that is more likely to experience long-term unemployment, s/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.</p><p>  In addition, the Youth Guarantee initiative is specifically aimed at those under 25 who are unemployed with specific targeting of those who are either long-term unemployed or are most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  Summary statistical information on the clients&rsquo; age, duration of unemployment, and last held occupation together with other demographic and regional information is published on the Central Statistics Office website.</p></reply>

The Ballymun Pilot is being mainly funded by the European Commission. Such specific funding for other pilot programmes is not available. Moreover, it is unlikely that the Department will operate a specific scheme for each of its 60+ local offices. However there will be flexibility to tailor the implementation to local conditions (for example with regard to the cohorts of young people to be selected for engagement in the first instance etc.) and the specific approach to be followed in each area will be a matter for local DSP management in consultation with relevant stakeholders. It is intended that the approach in other areas will however benefit from the lessons learned during the Ballymun pilot. In particular, it is intended, that local employment initiatives will be driven by local employer groups, local DSP/Intreo staff, local community groups and local training providers working collaboratively, as in Ballymun, to tailor the approach to their local circumstances.</p></reply>

In 2006, the CER approved a new network connections policy which enabled assessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite. The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p><p>  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town or group of towns to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs. Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers. Under the CER's policy framework, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive assessment of towns not already connected to the national gas network. A New Towns Analysis Phase 1 report was published in 2006<font color="#004080">. </font> The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting towns to the natural gas network in Galway/Mayo and the CER made the decision to allow Gaslink to extend the network to eleven of these towns, including Athenry. Prior to the roll out of each town, a detailed analysis of the loads within the town and the revenues associated with them is carried out. There is also a requirement to secure a certain level of customers prior to the development commencing. The gas network has been extended to seven of these towns and work is progressing on the development of the network to Tuam. Work is ongoing to secure economic loads in the three remaining towns, i.e. Athenry, Knock and Ballyhaunis, prior to the commencement of construction. To date, the projected loads are insufficient to justify commencement of construction.</p></reply>

The development and provision of SAORSAT, which is a &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; satellite system providing access to the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4, was undertaken by RT&Eacute; on its own initiative and, as in the case of the SAORVIEW DTT network, is not a matter in which I have a function. Ireland is not the only country to have introduced a national TV network on both a terrestrial and satellite platform. Many countries, including the UK, have developed their digital networks on both the traditional terrestrial platform and also over satellite. The reason for this is simple. It is technically and financially impossible to provide 100% coverage using a terrestrial TV platform. However, through SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, Ireland now has 100% &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4 for the first time in the history of the State. That said, I have noted the specific details of the case raised by the Deputy in this Question and have had them brought to the attention of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s network company, 2RN.</p></reply>

The Scheme was for the provision of a new wastewater treatment plant and the upgrade and extension of the collection network in the town at an estimated overall cost of &euro;4.8 million. My Department approved Galway County Council&rsquo;s revised design proposals for the Kinvara Sewerage Scheme in January 2012. This approval allowed the Council to progress the scheme to construction without further recourse to my Department other than to obtain confirmation that the necessary capital funding was in place before signing a c ontract with the successful tenderer. However, no request for approval of such funding for this scheme was received by my Department from Galway County Council. From 1 January 2014 Irish Water is responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure. Irish Water is currently preparing its Capital Investment Plan for 2014&ndash;16 and this will provide for the transition of projects which were included in my Department&rsquo;s 2010&ndash;13 Water Services Investment Programme.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services. The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water. The CER will be responsible for protecting the interests of customers and the charges levied by Irish Water will be subject to the approval of their water charges plan by the CER. Local authorities have been instructed to continue with all of their current charging regimes on behalf of Irish Water, pending the consideration by the Commission for Energy Regulation of a water charges plan to be developed by Irish Water. The<i></i>current VAT exemption for supplies of water by local authorities will also apply to supplies of water by Irish Water.</p></reply>

The centres act as &lsquo;brokers&rsquo; between potential volunteers and organisations seeking volunteers. The centres are linked by a common database and a common best practice approach. They also work with organisations to develop their volunteer management capacity and facilitate Garda vetting for smaller organisations. My Department also provides funding to Volunteer Ireland, the national volunteer development agency. The focus of Volunteer Ireland is to create an enabling environment for volunteering, to develop an ethos of volunteerism across all sectors of society and to be an independent and legitimate voice for volunteering. While there are encouraging signs of improvement in the economic outlook, difficult decisions continue to be necessary, allocations in most expenditure programmes remain constrained for 2014 and, like other Departments, my Department&rsquo;s budget has been reduced for 2014. My primary concern has been to make every effort to ensure that the daily front-line services, including Volunteer Ireland and volunteer centres, provided with funding from my Department, are protected to the greatest extent possible. In this regard I have kept the reductions, (approximately 5%) to both Volunteer Ireland and Volunteer Centres to a minimum and they have been notified recently of their funding allocations for 2014.</p></reply>

Each local authority sets out an annual programme of action, detailing the enforcement activities towards which this funding will be utilised. Typically, such programmes also include actions to tackle illegal dumping.</p><p>  In 2012, a once-off grant allocation was provided to assist local authorities improve enforcement in the area of fly tipping and small-scale illegal dumping. It was intended that these grants should be utilised to assist in the deployment of staff and the purchase of appropriate equipment to tackle the problem of fly tipping and small-scale illegal dumping in known problem areas with in their functional areas. A total sum of &euro;750,000 was allocated to the 34 local authorities under the scheme. Measures eligible for funding included the purchase of mobile CCTV equipment and associated signage/dummy boxes, training and deployment for local authority staff and the employment of external CCTV contractors.  The specific number and location of CCTV systems installed is not available in my Department. </p><p>  Data available under the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System show that the number of areas surveyed in 2012 deemed to be completely unpolluted stands at 10.4%, the highest level achieved since monitoring began. Conversely, the number of areas surveyed deemed to be grossly polluted at 0.3% is at the lowest ever level. This demonstrates clearly that our efforts in tackling litter are paying dividends.</p><p>  Also during 2012, my Department entered into a negotiated agreement with the National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI) to mount a national litter campaign in the print media, aimed specifically at tackling the issues of littering and illegal dumping. The NNI, made available, free of charge, &euro;500,000 worth of advertising space to raise awareness of the damaging effects that fly tipping and small-scale illegal dumping have on our environment and our economy, particularly on the tourism and agriculture sectors. Advertisements appeared in national, regional and local newspapers and magazines over the course of the peak summer period, highlighting the impact of illegal dumping and providing information for people to report illegal dumping activity to the Environment Protection Agency (EPA)&rsquo;s lo-call hotline number 1850 365 121.</p><p>  My Department does not collect information in relation to the volume of calls received by the EPA on their illegal dumping hotline.</p></reply>

However, I understand that the scheme will apply to all dwellings built before 1915  which are situated in certain designated areas of the 6 cities included under the scheme - Limerick, Waterford, Cork, Dublin, Galway and Kilkenny. The scheme is targeted at run-down areas of these cities with a view to encouraging greater owner/occupancy in inner-city areas. The specific areas in each city for inclusion under the scheme have not yet been decided. These areas will be designated following consultation with the concerned local authorities and other Government agencies. </p><p>  The scheme will also be subject to EU State Aid approval, which is likely to take several months. A state-aid application will shortly be submitted to the European Commission in this regard. Consequently it is expected that it will be late 2014 or more likely early 2015 before the scheme will commence<font color="#1F497D">. </font></p><p>  A mechanism is currently in place to disincentivise the hoarding and non-development of land for housing or for other purposes through the derelict sites levy provided for under section 23 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990. This levy, which only applies to sites in urban areas, allows local authorities to apply an annual levy of 3 per cent of the market value of the derelict, but potentially developable, site in question subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The levy has proven difficult to apply in practice as the non-development of the sites in question may be due to factors outside the control of the site owner. </p><p>  However, the Government is currently considering a strategy for the construction sector and in that context my Department will be ensuring that appropriate measures are considered to empower local authorities to ensure land is brought forward for development in a timely and sustainable manner. </p><p>  There is no specific grant scheme in operation to assist householders in the renovation of old houses, whether they are subject to a preservation order or not. The only grant scheme funded by my Department that might possibly be availed of in this regard is the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants to assist older people and people with a disability to have necessary repairs, adaptations or improvement works carried out in order to meet their accommodation needs. </p><p>  The suite of grants includes three separate grant measures; the Mobility Aids Grant scheme with grants of up to &euro;6,000, the Housing Aid for Older People scheme with grants of up to &euro;10,500 and the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability with grants of up to &euro;30,000, depending on house hold income. The schemes are administered by the local authorities and it is a matter for each local authority to determine the extent of the grant-eligible works, the amount of grant aid to be paid in individual cases and how applications are prioritised.</p></reply>

As part of the measures which are coordinated under Operation Fiacla, Operation Acer is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region, including the Dun Laoghaire Garda District.  It is an intelligence driven operation and includes analysis led checkpoints and patrols to target specific areas and case manage targeted offenders. These arrangements are kept under review to ensure adjustments are made to maintain the effective focus of the operation.</p><p>  In addition to Operation Acer, Operation Legacy was set up in Dun Laoghaire to target incidents of burglary and associated crime in the area.

These strategies utilise dedicated patrols, engagement with the parents of children in the area.

Priority is being given to processing applications and making lump sum payments.  As the deputy is aware, within my own Department a unit of 9 officials is working full time on engaging with the women and processing applications.  They are available to answer any queries the women may have in relation to the Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Scheme, 705 applications have been received to date.  320 letters of formal offer have issued.  So far, 225 of the applicants have accepted the formal offer and 196 payments have issued at a cost of &euro;7 million.</p><p>  In addition to the lump sum payment each woman is entitled to a top up payment to bring her weekly income from the State to &euro;230.30 if aged 66 or over and &euro;100 if under that age.  The Department of Social Protection is establishing a separate scheme in order to give effect to this recommendation and I have been informed that this will be in place by the middle of this year.  However, the payments will be backdated to the 1st August 2013 so the women will not be at a loss.</p><p>  Legislation relating to taxation issues has already been addressed.  It has been agreed that my Department would coordinate legislation to implement Judge Quirke's other recommendations where legislation is required. The necessary legislation is included on the priority list of the Government Legislation Programme for the Spring/Summer 2014.  One aspect to be dealt with by this Bill is Judge Quirke's recommendations that legislation should be introduced to give effect to his recommendation with regard to the provision of medical services to the women who were admitted to and worked in the relevant institutions.   Details of exactly what services will be provided, how they will be provided and where they will be provided is being determined by the Department of Health.

To this end, on the 5th November 2013, the Government agreed to the payments and services to be provided on an individual basis to the women who came within the scope of the scheme.</p><p>  Within my own Department, a unit of 9 officials is working full time on engaging with the women and processing applications.  They are available to answer any queries the women may have in relation to the Scheme.</p><p>  Decisions on establishing a permanent and separate dedicated unit, its role and method of operation have not been finalised as yet.

The Scheme ensures primarily that fallen bovine animals over 48 months, which must be BSE-tested in accordance with EU legislation, are disposed of in compliance with animal and public health and environmental regulations. </p><p>  The Scheme subsidises the collection by animal collectors of fallen cattle over 48 months from farms and their transportation to Category 1 rendering plants. The rendering and disposal costs of over 48 month fallen cattle in Category 1 plants are fully covered by the Scheme. The subsidy has two components, &euro;30 paid to the animal collector and &euro;58 paid to the Category 1 renderer in respect of each animal. The collection charge to the farmer is capped at &euro;54.03, including VAT. </p><p>  The Scheme also allows for a payment to animal collectors for a certain number of sheep and goats over 18 months that are tested for Scrapie. The number of sheep and goats to be tested for Scrapie varies from year to year and a payment of &euro;5 is made to animal collectors for the sheep and goats that are prepared on the knackery premises by the collectors for sampling, provided the samples yield a conclusive result. </p><p>  My Department has recently examined the operation of the Subsidy Scheme and a number of changes have been introduced, with effect from 30th   November 2013, in relation to fallen bovines over 48 months. These include enhanced compliance provisions and putting some limits on the distance material can be carried while maintaining choice. This examination took into account a number of factors, including budgetary considerations, TSE testing requirements, Animal By-Product (ABP) regulations, the need to maintain competition and the need for an adequate collection and disposal infrastructure. It is important to note that the rates payable under the Scheme have not changed.</p><p>  Bovines under 48 months and all sheep and goats (with the exception of the &euro;5 payment detailed above), are outside the remit of the Subsidy Scheme, and their collection and rendering is a matter for commercial arrangement.</p></reply>

The white fish and inshore fleets have been particularly affected.  As the catching sector is by definition dependant on being able to go out and catch fish, and crews earn their living through a share of the catch, many fishermen have suffered financially because of this extended period restricted to port.  We had some breaks in the weather during February and many of the vessels that were harbour bound due to the severe weather were able to return to fishing and to some extent make up for lost time.  No doubt we will continue to have intermittent stormy conditions in the weeks and months ahead, as is normal for this time of year, but I am hopeful that fishermen will be able to put to sea on a regular basis so that they can put that difficult period behind them.</p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in all sectors who have been unable to work because of adverse weather conditions.  </p><p>  As income from fishing is derived from landings of catch, the amount that can be caught and therefore the income from most fisheries is determined by the EU quotas which are restrictive, and made available under our management arrangements with catch limits set for whitefish each month.   The quotas are managed to allow for access to quota for the full twelve months of the year, as far as possible.  This may mean in many cases that the allocations made available for certain months are set at low levels, certainly less than Industry would like and would be capable of landing.   </p><p>  I always work very closely with, and I am advised by industry when setting catch limits during the year.  Each month, a quota management advisory committee, involving Industry representatives and my Department, meets and examines available quota, uptake levels and the market situation and make recommendations to me on catch limits for the following month.  The quota uptake figures for January 2014 and for the first part of February were significantly down.  In order that vessel owners and their crews are enabled to compensate as early as possible for these low catch levels, allocations for March were set for a number of the key economic stocks at a higher level than in February.

The white fish and inshore fleets have been particularly affected.  As the catching sector is by definition dependant on being able to go out and catch fish, and crews earn their living through a share of the catch, many fishermen have suffered financially because of this extended period restricted to port.  We had some breaks in the weather during February and many of the vessels that were harbour bound due to the severe weather were able to return to fishing and to some extent make up for lost time.  No doubt we will continue to have intermittent stormy conditions in the weeks and months ahead, as is normal for this time of year, but I am hopeful that fishermen will be able to put to sea on a regular basis so that they can put that difficult period behind them.</p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in all sectors who have been unable to work because of adverse weather conditions.  </p><p>  As income from fishing is derived from landings of catch, the amount that can be caught and therefore the income from most fisheries is determined by the EU quotas which are restrictive, and made available under our management arrangements with catch limits set for whitefish each month.   The quotas are managed to allow for access to quota for the full twelve months of the year, as far as possible.  This may mean in many cases that the allocations made available for certain months are set at low levels, certainly less than Industry would like and would be capable of landing.   </p><p>  I always work very closely with, and I am advised by industry when setting catch limits during the year.  Each month, a quota management advisory committee, involving Industry representatives and my Department, meets and examines available quota, uptake levels and the market situation and make recommendations to me on catch limits for the following month.  The quota uptake figures for January 2014 and for the first part of February were significantly down.  In order that vessel owners and their crews are enabled to compensate as early as possible for these low catch levels, allocations for March were set for a number of the key economic stocks at a higher level than in February.   The level recommended by industry took account of concerns not to glut the market with very high landings in a single month and on that basis the arrangements recommended and put in place involve modest increases in key whitefish stocks including cod, haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea, monkfish and megrim in the Celtic Sea and the hake stock in the Celtic Sea and the North-West.  </p><p>  These increased quotas and fishing opportunities for March will help to re-balance the landings to bring them more into line with planned annual spread of quota uptake.

It is widely accepted that there is a need to move from the practice of unnecessary hospital admissions for chronic asthma.  However, proposals for additional resources must be considered by the HSE in the context of the service planning process and by the Department in the context of the annual estimates process.</p><p>  The HSE, through its Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division, established the National Clinical Programme for Asthma (NCPA), which is one of a number of chronic disease programmes aimed at bringing a systematic approach to changes in how services for patients are delivered.</p><p>  The overarching aim of the NCPA is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby, avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, at hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services. </p><p>  The development of the Programme has been influenced by international evidence of the effectiveness of asthma management, with significantly improved outcomes focusing on improving asthma control in the community.</p><p>  The initial work of the National Clinical Programme for Asthma has been on the development of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice, early asthma diagnosis, active asthma treatment, guided self-management and patient education.</p><p>  The Programme has also developed a National Model of Care for Asthma, which details how physicians, nurses and other health professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances; and to collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.</p><p>  The National Clinical Programme for Asthma is listed in the HSE&rsquo;s Primary Care Divisional Operational Plan for 2014 and work is underway on an implementation plan for the Model of Care.</p><p>  The work of the Programme will ensure that patients with asthma will benefit from being part of a well-managed integrated system of care, coordinated at primary care level.</p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS contract with GPs, with an increased emphasis on management of chronic conditions, such as asthma, diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  These aspects are similarly reflected in the draft contract to underpin the provision of GP care, free at the point of use, for all children under six years of age, which is currently under consideration as part of a public consultation process.</p></reply>
