The current process for the appointment of judges in Ireland is set out in sections 12 to 17 of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995 which established the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.</p><p>  Under the existing system of judicial appointments, the Board submits to me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, the names of the persons who have applied for appointment and whom it recommends as suitable for appointment.  This procedure has been in place since 1995 and, at my request, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the judicial appointments process.  This review will consider how best to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence and includes consideration of issues such as the appointment process, eligibility criteria, the role of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and the need to promote equality and diversity.</p><p>  In December I initiated a public consultation process which involved not only members of the judiciary and the legal profession generally, but also engaged the broader public who benefit daily in innumerable ways from the protection of an independent judiciary.  A total of 25 submissions have been received to date, including a submission from the Judicial Appointments Review Committee, and they will now be considered within my Department.  The consultation process sought submissions within the current Constitutional provisions and any proposal to introduce a new system of appointments which would require statutory amendments would, of course, be a matter for consideration by Government in the first instance.</p></reply>

The report was received by the Department on 18 February 2014.</p><p>  I gave the Cabinet my assessment of the potential damage to both the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and more widely to public confidence in the enforcement of law, from the ongoing controversy relating to reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC.  The manner in which this controversy had continued, and the new information I had received, led me to the view that it was in the public interest that measures be taken to ensure that the full truth is established beyond dispute.  In the light of that, I and my Cabinet colleagues agreed to the appointment of a retired High Court Judge to inquire into all  matters of relevance to the controversy.</p><p>  The Government subsequently appointed retired High Court Judge John Cooke to conduct an independent Inquiry into the reports of unlawful surveillance of the GSOC.  The Terms of Reference for the Inquiry were agreed by the Government, on the advice of the Attorney General, and are available on the Department of the Taoiseach's website (www.taoiseach.gov.ie).  Judge Cooke has been asked to report on these matters within 8 weeks or as soon as may be thereafter. Judge Cooke will be provided with any technical and secretarial assistance he requires, and I expect that all parties will cooperate fully with him.</p><p>  I have already outlined to the House during the Private Members Motion on 18 February 2014 some of the differences that were highlighted in both reports.  Copies of both technical reports will be provided to Judge Cooke as part of his inquiry.  I am also arranging for a summary comparison report to be prepared for the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions<b>.</b></p></reply>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 seeks to achieve those objectives by specifying the functions of the Garda Commissioner and the Force on the one hand, and the Minister for Justice, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas on the other.</p><p>  The 2005 Act provides that the Commissioner has the function of directing and controlling the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that he is accountable to me as the Minister for Justice, and through me to the Oireachtas, for the performance of that function.  The Commissioner is responsible for recruitment, training, discipline, the distribution of members and for all other aspects of the management and administration of the Force.  The 2005 Act also made the Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Force, and liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in that capacity.</p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to provide independent oversight of complaints made against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda Ombudsman Commission has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded, and has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities, including full police powers of investigation.</p><p>  Some weeks ago I announced that I would be bringing to Cabinet a number of amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 relating to the Garda Ombudsman Commission.  It has subsequently been agreed at Cabinet that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality would be asked to hold such hearings as it deems appropriate and necessary for the purpose of making any recommendations as to amendments it proposes be made to the 2005 Act.  I expect the Committee will consider, as part of its deliberations, the extent of the remit of the Ombudsman Commission. I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the deliberations of the Committee and I look forward to the Committee's report on the matter.</p></reply>

In that context, I am sure the House will appreciate that we must be judicious in our comments with regard to the case.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation into this crime is ongoing.  A file on the case has been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The DPP is, of course, independent in the performance of her functions.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have had the co-operation and assistance of their colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland from the outset of this investigation and that continues to be the case.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that in such circumstances, where a Garda investigation is current and where matters are with the DPP, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in any further detail.</p><p>  I would say, however, and I feel sure the Deputy will agree with me, that there can never be any justification for the criminal, violent taking of human life, no matter what the circumstances.  This was a brutal, violent killing and it deserves condemnation.</p><p>  As would be expected in the normal course of a criminal investigation, the Garda investigation team has retained certain items which were recovered at the crime scene and which are of relevance to their inquiries and for potential evidential purposes.</p><p>  I am aware that the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman is conducting an investigation into certain matters relating to the victim in this case and has sought the assistance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To the extent that it is possible for the Garda authorities to co-operate with the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman they will seek to do so.  They must, however, be conscious of the legal constraints applying given that they must ensure that the ongoing murder inquiry and the chances of a successful prosecution arising would not be compromised in any way.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware, of course, that the remit of the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman does not extend to this jurisdiction; rather it is specific to policing and the police service in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The House will appreciate that the first duty of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this matter is to investigate the brutal killing that has taken place in this jurisdiction and that other matters, although they may be related to the victim of that killing, cannot override that process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-27a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700052#WRA01500"><p>The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 makes it an offence for any person to deliberately withhold information regarding sexual and other serious offences committed against a child or other vulnerable person.  Under section 2 of the Act, a person who knows or believes that an offence has been committed against a child and has information which he or she believes would be of material assistance in the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of that perpetrator and who fails to disclose that information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is guilty of an offence.  That offence, however, is without prejudice to any right or privilege that may arise in criminal proceedings entitling a person to refuse to disclose information.  The extent to which such right or privilege may arise would be a matter for a court to determine.</p><p>  It is my understanding that the Law Society has also taken steps to try to address this question in the updated and third edition of 'A Guide to Good Professional Conduct for Solicitors' which it published in October 2013.  In dealing with issues of privilege and confidentiality, guidance is provided in the new Guide for solicitors in relation to cases involving abuse or neglect of children as follows -  <i>&quot;Similarly, there may be situations where an adult discloses abuse or neglect either by himself or by another adult against a child but refuses to allow any disclosure to third parties. If the situation indicates continuing sexual or other physical abuse, or ongoing neglect of a child, and there is a serious threat to the child&rsquo;s life or health, whether mental or physical, but there is a refusal on the part of the client to allow disclosure of such information, if the situation is sufficiently serious, a breach of the overriding duty of confidentiality may be justified and a confidential referral to a medical practitioner can be made. The solicitor should consider whether the situation is sufficiently serious to justify such a breach.&quot; </i>  (A Guide to Good Professional Conduct for Solicitors, 3rd Ed., p.33-34)</p><p>  In relation to the course of action open to a client of a solicitor who feels aggrieved by the actions of that solicitor in relation to the protection of the client's interests concerned, it should be noted that the Law Society is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of solicitors under the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2013 to which complaints about such a grievance should be made. Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which has just completed Committee Stage, this function will transfer to the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority which will similarly become responsible for dealing with complaints about the professional conduct of barristers. Under this new and independent conduct regime, both solicitors and barristers will also be amenable to the new Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal which will deal with allegations of serious misconduct.</p></reply>

The first independent Confidential Recipient was appointed in March 2008.</p><p>  Any member or civilian of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wishing to make a confidential report is required to do so in good faith and for the purpose of exposing the alleged corruption or malpractice. The Confidential Recipient is required to transmit each confidential report to the Garda Commissioner (or to the Minister, if the report contains an allegation which relates to the Commissioner), who must investigate it and take any necessary action (unless it is believed that the allegations were not made in good faith or were false, frivolous or vexatious).</p><p>  In transmitting a report to the Commissioner or Minister, the Confidential Recipient must protect the identity of the whistleblower, subject only to an exception, which is subject to stringent conditions, where knowledge of the whistleblower&rsquo;s identity is essential for the proper investigation of the allegations.  Any communication between the Confidential Recipient and the whistleblower is absolutely confidential.</p><p>  Regulation 15(1) of the Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice Regulations 2007 requires the Garda Commissioner to report to me not later than four months after the end of each year in relation to any confidential reports made during that year.  I am circulating with this reply the number of confidential reports made during the years since the procedure was first introduced. I do not have available to me statistics in respect of internal complaints within An Garda Siochana prior to that.</p><p>  Mr Oliver Connolly was appointed to the post of Confidential Recipient on 18 July 2011 for a three year period.  As the Deputy is aware, recent events had undermined the office of the Confidential Recipient and Mr Connolly was relieved of his position on 19 February 2014.</p><p>  I have publicly said that I do not believe the office of Confidential Recipient and the legislation applicable to it is fulfilling the objective for which it was established.  I have stated my intention to abolish the office and to enable members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who allege misconduct within the Force to have their complaints considered and addressed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission. The Cabinet has agreed that an appropriate amendment to the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 should be prepared to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to be prescribed under that Bill as a body to which disclosures may be made by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  Interim arrangements will be made to fill the Post of Confidential Recipient by the appointment of a retired judge. Every effort will be made to expedite the necessary consultation process so that the appointment can be made as soon as possible.</p><p>Garda Commissioner reports on confidential reports  2008 through to 2013.</p><p><b>Year </b><b>No of Reports</b></p><p>20082</p><p>20094</p><p>20102</p><p>20111</p><p>20123</p><p>20131</p></reply>

On top of that personal tragedy, his murder was also an event that can only be described as a heinous crime carried out by ruthless individuals with no respect for human life. In view of the fact that Garda Richard Fallon was carrying out his duties as a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, his murder was also a direct attack on the institutions of this State.</p><p>  The Serious Review Crime Team of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is carrying out a review of this case.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-27a.34.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700052#WRA02400"><p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of protection applicants in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal. Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application.</p><p>  The operation of the Direct Provision system is kept under constant review and I have consistently acknowledged that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire to have applicants remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case. The direct provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the head of persons while their protection or related leave to remain applications are being processed. It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is under financial difficulty.</p><p>  The numbers of asylum seekers residing in direct provision has reduced significantly over the last five years.  At the end of December 2013 there were 4,360 residents in direct provision according to RIA's database compared with 6,494 at the end of December 2009.  This represents a reduction of 2,134, or 33%, in the number of residents in direct provision in that period.  Compared to the numbers residing in direct provision at its highest point in April 2005 (8,080), there has been a reduction of 46% or 3,720 persons in the intervening nine years.</p><p>  The median processing time to a final decision on an asylum application in 2013 was 36 weeks.  Some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and other relevant statutory provisions.  High quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.</p><p>  Persons who are refused refugee status are notified of their entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection.  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I made new Regulations last year governing the investigation and determination of applications for subsidiary protection in the State. The  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which came into effect on 14 November 2013, were made to address certain matters which arose from the judgment of the High Court in January 2013 in the MM case.</p><p>  Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Once the new arrangements have bedded down, my aim is for applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.</p><p>  Legislative reform in the area of protection remains a key priority.  Work on a new Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which remains part of the Government's Legislative Programme, is being advanced to enable publication later this year.  The Bill will provide, inter alia, for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State.  This re-organisation of the protection application processing framework should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more &lsquo;straight forward&rsquo; and timely fashion.</p></reply>

What I can say is that there are statutory provisions in place governing interception of communications and to regulate the use of surveillance equipment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  The Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 provides the legislative basis for the interception of postal packets and telecommunications messages. Authorisations for interception may only be granted by Ministerial Warrant on application by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.  Furthermore they can only be granted for the investigation of serious crime or in the interest of the security of the State.</p><p>  The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 provides a legislative basis for covert surveillance activities. However, as Minister for Justice and Equality I have no role whatsoever in authorising the carrying out of such activities. An authorisation under the 2009 Act can only be granted by a Judge of the District Court on application by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Revenue Commissioners or the Defence Forces.</p><p>  There are strict oversight and control mechanisms in place for both Acts. Both are subject to independent judicial oversight by a Designated Judge of the High Court, who has complete and unrestricted access to all cases, documents, records, and personnel pertaining to  the operation of the legislation  In addition, the Designated Judge is required to report to the Taoiseach on an annual basis on the operation of the legislation. These reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I should also add that both Acts provide for a complaints mechanism whereby an individual who believes he or she has been subject to an authorisation for surveillance or whose communications have been intercepted may apply to the independent Complaints Referee for an investigation into the matter.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that there have been examples over the years where criminals and subversive groups have been in possession of sophisticated surveillance and counter surveillance equipment, either for criminal purposes or in an attempt to avoid detection by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  With regard to Interpol, I am further informed that exchanges between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Interpol take place as operational requirements demand.</p></reply>

Mr Oliver Connolly was appointed as Confidential Recipient with effect from 18 July 2011 for a 3 year period. The appointment followed the required consultation with the Garda Commissioner, the Garda Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate, the Garda representative associations and the trade unions or staff associations representing civilian staff.</p><p>  Rumours were circulating for some time regarding the existence of an alleged tape and transcript of a confidential conversation between Mr Connolly and Sergeant Maurice McCabe. I am not aware of the circumstances in which the alleged tape was made or the transcript published. At all times it has been my view that communications between the Confidential Recipient and a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are matters private to both parties.</p><p>  Given the importance of the office&rsquo;s confidentiality, no justice minister could properly seek out such a transcript or tape. However, following an alleged extract from the alleged tape being placed on the D&aacute;il record, I asked my Department to contact Mr Connolly outlining my concerns that, if the conversation as reported had taken place, his actions had undermined the office of the Confidential Recipient. </p><p>  Contacts with Mr Connolly over the following weeks did not satisfy me as to his response to the controversy.  I wrote to him on 19 February 2014 and informed him that in the context of his failure to unequivocally repudiate the content of the alleged conversation or take the necessary action to restore public confidence in the office of Confidential Recipient, I believed his position was untenable and I had no alternative but to relieve him of the position.</p><p>  I do not propose to comment further on the alleged tape and transcript other than to say that I want to make it clear that I have no animosity towards Sergeant McCabe.  I have absolutely no wish to have a continuing public, or indeed private, dispute with a serving member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The UFF loyalist paramilitary group subsequently claimed responsibility for the murder.  It is a matter of regret that to date no person has been made amenable for this appalling crime and I am conscious that this must add to the family&rsquo;s grief.</p><p>  Following a submission by the family in relation to the concerns about the murder in 2003 the Garda Commissioner established a review team to carry out a thorough investigation into all matters of concern that had been raised.  The Garda review, which was led by a Chief Superintendent, involved the taking of more than 150 statements and the interviewing of more than 120 people.  The Garda review was completed in 2005 and a report was submitted to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In the period following the completion of the review there was ongoing interaction between the Garda authorities and the PSNI on issues relevant to the investigation.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the murder of Mr. Fullerton is now listed for review by the Serious Crime Review Team at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.</p><p>  The investigation into Mr. Fullerton's murder remains open and I can assure the Deputy and, indeed, the Fullerton family that any further lines of inquiry arising from new information from any quarter will be actively pursued by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

I am very conscious of the need to ensure that all victims of crime are helped to navigate the criminal justice system with the minimum level of discomfort and distress. However this has to be balanced with the rights of the accused.</p><p>  The National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan was developed by the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG), chaired by my colleague, the Minister for Disability, Equality, Mental Health &amp;amp; Older People, Ms. Kathleen Lynch, T.D., in line with the commitment in the programme for Government. The Plan contains a commitment that the National Disability Authority will engage in discussions with key personnel in the justice system with a view to identifying practical steps that can be taken to improve the accessibility of the system and its procedures for people with disabilities.</p><p>  I believe that the provisions of the Victims of Crime Directive will strengthen support to all victims, including those with disabilities. The Directive, which covers all victims of crime, is due to be implemented by the Member States by the 16th of November 2015. The Directive provides that the victim should   be able to understand and be understood, receive appropriate information about their case, have access to victim support services and be individually assessed to identify specific protection needs and to be heard. A further provision in the Directive states that the victim may be accompanied by a person of their choice for interviews with police, unless a reasoned decision has been made to the contrary. It is my intention to have legislation enacted to comply with the Directive by November, 2015, the deadline contained in the Directive.</p></reply>

This exercise would entail the diversion of a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time which could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources. </p><p>The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that sentenced prisoners may be approved temporary release whether it be for a few hours or a more extended period. The Act sets out the circumstances when temporary release may be provided and what matters must be taken into account.</p><p>  Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect.</p><p>  Each application for temporary release for whatever reason, including those referred to in your question, is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount.</p><p>  Prisoners given reviewable temporary release are typically given one weeks temporary release at which point the prisoner returns to the prison for a fresh decision. Short periods of temporary release are considered for humanitarian reasons for issues such as serious family illness, bereavements and other family issues. All releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a daily basis to the offender's Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute; or maybe refused another period of reviewable temporary release.</p></reply>

To illustrate this point, on 25 February, 2014, 4 people or 0.10%, out of a prison population of 4,053 were in custody for non-payment of fines.  There were no prisoners in custody for non-payment of debt.</p><p>  I am strongly of the view that we need to keep the numbers of people committed to prison for the non-payment of fines to the absolute minimum.  The Fines Payment and Recovery Bill, which was published last July and is before the Seanad (Second Stage) on 26 February, 2014 represents a major reform of our fine payment and recovery system  and provides for the payment of fines by instalment and attachment of earnings.</p><p>  Allowing everyone to pay a fine by instalment and introducing attachment of earnings are important new reforms to the fine collection system which will lead to improved collection rates for fines.  The new measures provided for, combined with the requirement that judges must take a person&rsquo;s financial circumstances into account when setting a fine, should result in a reduction in the number of people committed to prison.</p><p>  When this Bill is enacted, it will be easier for people to pay a fine and where they fail to do so, there will be sufficient alternatives available to the courts to all but eliminate the need to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of fines.</p></reply>

The  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which came into effect on 14 November 2013, were made to address certain matters which arose from the judgment of the High Court in January 2013 in the MM case. The number of cases finalised in 2013 reflects the impact of the High Court judgement on the processing of Subsidiary Protection applications.</p><p>  Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Once the new arrangements have bedded down, my aim is for applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising. In those circumstances I would anticipate very significant inroads to be made on the caseload by the end of 2014.</p></reply>

The manner in which this controversy had continued, and the new information I had received, led me to the view that it was in the public interest that measures be taken to ensure that the full truth is established beyond dispute.  In the light of that, I and my Cabinet colleagues agreed to the appointment of a retired High Court Judge to inquire into all  matters of relevance to the controversy.</p><p>  The Government subsequently appointed retired High Court Judge John Cooke to conduct an independent Inquiry into the reports of unlawful surveillance of the GSOC.  The Terms of Reference for the Inquiry were agreed by the Government, on the advice of the Attorney General, and are available on the Department of the Taoiseach's website (www.taoiseach.gov.ie).  Judge Cooke has been asked to report on these matters within 8 weeks or as soon as may be thereafter.</p><p>  Judge Cooke will be provided with any technical and secretarial assistance he requires, and I expect that all parties will co-operate fully with him.</p></reply>

Niall Molloy.  While Mr. McGinn's terms of reference require that he complete this examination as soon as possible, it is not possible to provide a precise timescale in this regard.</p><p>  Insofar as the nature of this review is concerned, I have previously outlined that it is intended that the review would serve two functions.</p><p>  In the first instance, and in accordance with his terms of reference, Mr. McGinn will prepare a report on any issues of public interest which may arise from the report of the Serious Crime Review Team, with due regard to the rights of those involved, so as to facilitate his report being put into the public domain.</p><p>  Secondly, and insofar as the question of any further inquiry is concerned, the position is that Mr.McGinn's terms of reference require that, taking into account existing mechanisms for the investigation of offences, he identify matters, if any, of significant public interest or concern which would warrant examination by a further inquiry and in respect of which such further inquiry would have a reasonable prospect of establishing the truth.  Proceeding to establish a further inquiry at this point would pre-empt this independent assessment.</p><p>  My immediate priority is to allow the Senior Counsel to carry out his examination so that the maximum amount of information can be put into the public domain at the earliest possible date, at which point I will also give full consideration to the outcome of the examination concerning any further inquiry.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p><p>  I share the Deputies' concerns in relation to burglaries and other crimes. I am aware that in order to counter these recent crimes the Garda Commissioner established a Divisional Operation which is currently in force in the Donegal Division. Additional resources are being deployed in the area and with a particular focus on crimes against the elderly. The Garda&iacute; are determined to identify those responsible for this criminal activity and to bring them before the Courts.</p><p>  This operation, consisting of intelligence led patrols, checkpoints, intelligence gathering and analysis is being run in conjunction with the National and Regional Operations Fiacla and Airgead, which were specifically set up to combat instances of criminality, including burglary and related crimes. Targeted patrolling has been intensified following the recent incidents of burglaries and related crimes and there is ongoing and excellent liaison between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are utilising all available resources and legislation. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to develop and implement strategies available to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods to facilitate targeted operations in order to enable early intervention and prevention of such crimes. Garda actions to counteract burglary have been very successful and under Operation Fiacla have led to the arrest of 7,973 persons and 4,558 persons being charged as of 31 January 2014.</p><p>  There are 409 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Donegal Division together with 28 Garda Reserves and 29 civilian staff. There are also national units such as the Garda National Drug Unit and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation which are also available to help the Garda&iacute; when needed.

As the Deputy will be aware the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory independent body established under the Refugee Act, 1996 to decide appeals against negative recommendations in respect of applications for refugee status issued by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality in relation to whether or not refugee status should be granted. As the appeal in this case has been remitted for re-hearing by the Tribunal, the Tribunal has yet to make its recommendation in the case to me. In the circumstances, clearly any comment by me would be inappropriate.</p><p>  The management of the Tribunal is the responsibility of the Chairperson who under the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) is required &ldquo;<i>to ensure that the business of the Tribunal is managed efficiently and that the business assigned to each division is disposed of as expeditiously as may be consistent with fairness and natural justice</i>  &rdquo;.  The Deputy may be aware that in August, 2013 a new Chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal was appointed following a selection process run in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service. Since taking up his position, I understand that the Chairperson has begun a major review of Tribunal practices, procedures and guidelines.  In September, 2013 the Assigning Policy of the Tribunal was published, which details how cases are assigned amongst the various members of the Tribunal. The new Chairperson has also established a Tribunal Users Group which comprises of the Chairperson and representatives nominated by the Law Society and the Bar Council. I am informed that the group will meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of interest and/or concern to users of the Tribunal.  I am advised that the Group has considered draft procedural guidelines which will set out the practice and procedure relating to how appeals are dealt with by the Tribunal. Other guidelines are also in preparation, including a comprehensive guideline for dealing with child applicants.</p><p>  Following on from the appointment of new Tribunal members and the expansion of the Tribunal's remit to the area of subsidiary protection under the  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which I signed into law in November 2013, a comprehensive training programme has been undertaken by the Tribunal, to ensure that the new members are fully equipped to discharge their duties to the highest professional standards.</p><p>  I am informed that as part of this training programme, the Tribunal has been working closely with the UNHCR in developing a new decision template designed to enhance the robustness of the process and to assist Members in their difficult task. This process has been greatly enhanced by the participation, via the UNHCR, of an internationally recognised former Canadian refugee law judge who has been central to the training provided.  The Chairperson in his recently published strategy statement for 2014 - 2017 commits the Tribunal &ldquo;to consider and decide refugee, subsidiary protection and Dublin Regulation appeals to the highest professional standards.&rdquo; He has also committed to an ambitious reform programme to achieve the Tribunal&rsquo;s strategic goals and to undertaking a review of Tribunal policy on public access to Tribunal documents, including the Tribunal&rsquo;s database of previous decisions.  I am confident that the changes which I have outlined will have a major impact on the performance and perception of the Tribunal as they are integrated into its ethos and practices in the coming year.</p></reply>

I have raised my concerns at his continued detention without trial with the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Nabil Fahmy, on 11 November and 23 December 2013.   The Embassy of Ireland in Cairo has been actively liaising with the Egyptian authorities in relation to the case and contacts have included numerous meetings. Our Ambassador and her colleagues in Egypt have met with senior officials from the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Justice, and the office of the Prosecutor General.</p><p>  Consular officials in Dublin met with family representatives on 17 August, 19 September, 24 October and 16 December 2013, and 16 January 2014.  Consular visits were made to the individual named on 24 August, 8 September, 15 September, 10 October, 24 October, 30 October, 10 November, 21 November, 3 December and 18 December 2013 and 8 January, 26 January and 13 February 2014.  The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis raised this individual&rsquo;s case with both the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Nabil Fahmy, and the Prosecutor General, Hisham Barakat, during his visit to Cairo this month.  However, as the Deputy is aware, the individual named is still before the judicial system in Egypt and we are precluded from getting involved in the judicial process. On all recent visits this individual was found to be in good health and in reasonably good spirits despite the ordeal of being detained so long. He appears to be being well treated in the low-security prison in which he is being held. Regular family visits have also been permitted.  The Embassy and the Consular Assistance Section will continue to give all appropriate consular assistance.</p></reply>

Through the enlargement process, the EU has set out the reforms that are needed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have underlined that these measures are not just necessary for the country to advance towards EU membership, but that they are also in the interests of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The necessary actions include political, constitutional and economic reforms, as well as a sustained effort to tackle organised crime and corruption.  The EU has consistently called on the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to work together to undertake the necessary reforms, in the interests of their citizens.  I would support and reiterate that call. Minister Donohoe, when he visited Sarajevo in January, delivered this message clearly.</p><p>  The EU will continue to support Bosnia and Herzegovina as it embarks on reforms. For instance, Commissioner Fule, in a recent visit to Sarajevo, confirmed that the EU will expand its Structured Dialogue with Bosnia and Herzegovina on Justice to include the fight against corruption. The Commission has also launched a new initiative to focus on better economic governance in the Western Balkans. Bosnia and Herzegovina should be among the first countries to benefit from this approach. Finally, the EU will also work more closely with Bosnia and Herzegovina on fully utilising the funding already allocated from the European Union through the Instrument for Pre-Accession.  I would, however, reiterate the point that I expressed to the Deputy in reply to her Parliamentary Question last week: the solutions to the issues affecting the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina must come from within the country itself. The EU cannot impose remedies from outside.</p></reply>

The issue of a passport is the culmination of an important and legally binding process. The checks and balances within the passport process embrace the standard principles that are provided for in the Act and help to ensure that the identity of the applicant is known and that the person in question is an Irish citizen. This serves to maintain the worldwide good reputation and integrity of the Irish passport, which, in turn, ensures the safe travel and well-being of Irish citizens as they travel abroad. Moreover, it helps to combat passport and identity fraud.</p><p>  The Department received an application from the person in question on 11 June 2013.  Questions have arisen concerning the authenticity of an identity document submitted with the passport application which have been referred to the appropriate authorities.

Overall, the average lead time for appointments at NCTS Centres is 6.3 days (though it should be noted there can be little or no waiting time where bookings that are made directly at the NCTS Centres and a place is available through cancellation).</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that there has been a surge in vehicle registrations since the beginning of the year that is reflected in both new and used car sales.  This has obviously led to a spike in demand at NCTS Centres.  Revenue is acutely aware that this demand puts pressure on motor dealers and is actively working with NCTS management to ensure that this demand is met.  Revenue is confident that the measures that have been put in place will ensure the continuing provision of an efficient and effective service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-27a.146.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700055#WRD00500"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners who have responsibility for the collection of mineral oil products tax and for tackling the illicit trade in mineral oil products that the system of marking gas oil (diesel) has been an efficient means of delivering a tax rebate on a product used by a very large number of users across a wide range of uses.  These uses extend well beyond agriculture to include the propulsion of trains, the operation of construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea navigation (including fishing) and for commercial and home heating purposes.  Any change in the existing system would therefore impact across a wide range and huge number of users.</p><p>  A change to a rebate system would involve the establishment of an expensive repayments system. This would give rise to significant costs and place an administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners. It would also pose significant cash-flow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.  In addition, repayment schemes by their nature are very vulnerable to abuse. The introduction of a wide-ranging scheme such as that proposed would not necessarily offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements. If fuel for off-road use was not marked under the proposed new system, it could be diverted easily for road use; if it was marked, it could be laundered as at present.  It would also be the case that marked fuel from Northern Ireland would continue to be available and could be laundered by fuel criminals.  For these reasons, I am not proposing the cessation of current marking system or the introduction of a wide-ranging rebate system such as that proposed. </p><p>  While it is inherently difficult to estimate the extent of any illegal activity and there is no reliable estimate of the scale of illegal activity in the fuel sector, Revenue recognises that the laundering of the marker from marked gas oil represents a significant threat to the exchequer and to the legitimate trade. For this reason, Revenue has made action against this illegal activity one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem. Revenue's strategy includes the following elements:   </p><p>  -       The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;</p><p>  -       A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;</p><p>  -       New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis;</p><p>  -       Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, new supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013. These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions. Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary;</p><p>  -       An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations; and</p><p>  -       following a joint process, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK have identified a new product to mark rebated fuels in a move that will boost the fight against illegal fuel laundering in both jurisdictions.  </p><p>  Revenue also works with fuel sector representative bodies, which have been very supportive of the range of measures introduced to combat fuel laundering, to improve the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud. In support of this, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty evaded. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying fuel recklessly to dubious customers.  Revenue has recently published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.  </p><p>  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group and has established regional sub-groups to facilitate traders reporting suspicious matters through their representative associations on a confidential basis.  This information can assist Revenue in closing down the illicit trade by identifying traders supplying fuel to launderers and by identifying outlets that are selling laundered diesel.  </p><p>  Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results.  In the period from mid-2011 to end January 2014, 123 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.  Since the beginning of 2011, over 2.7 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 9 oil laundries in 2013.</p></reply>

Two of these are mobile x-ray container scanning systems that are based at Dublin Port and Rosslare Ferry Port respectively. Both of these scanners are available for deployment at other ports, and at other locations such as warehouses, as required, and Revenue uses them, on a risk assessment basis, at various locations throughout the country. The other mobile scanning system is a scanner van, a specialist vehicle incorporating an X-ray facility and radiation detection facilities. It is used for monitoring baggage and cargo at airports and ports for narcotics, cigarettes, radioactive materials and other contraband. It also allows Revenue officers to carry out control actions at other locations such as warehouses and courier depots.</p><p>  The mobile scanner systems are complemented by static baggage/parcel scanners at all major ports, airports and postal depots. I am advised that three modern replacement x-ray scanners for baggage were purchased in the recent past for use at Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport and Rosslare Ferry Port.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners continuously review their detection technology requirements, taking account of developments in those technologies, and have availed of part-funding under the European Union's Hercule II programme to acquire equipment of this kind. I understand that they are generally satisfied with their current scanning capabilities and consider that the container ports are adequately serviced by the two mobile X-ray container scanning systems. I am advised also that the performance of the scanner van since its acquisition is being evaluated on an ongoing basis and that the possibility of augmenting this resource with additional units is being considered.</p></reply>

Excise duty on off-licences is currently set at &euro;500 each per licence for a beer, wine or spirits off-licence. This means that a typical off-licence premises offering the full range of alcoholic beverages for sale pays &euro;1,500 per annum.   </p><p>  Licensed premises have a graduated licence duty fee structure based on turnover, with a total of six bands ranging from &euro;250 to &euro;3,805.  The Deputy seems to be suggesting that a similar turnover basis for calculating the duty for on-licences should be applied to large off-licences. While I am not unfavourably disposed to such a suggestion, I believe a number of issues need to be taken into consideration.  Any change to the arrangements in place for large supermarkets would also have to be applied to smaller outlets such as the off-licence on the corner. The licence regime for pubs is based on the entire turnover of the business including snacks, meals, tobacco and entertainment.  On the face of it, it would seem unreasonable to apply the same turnover definition to a supermarket whose core business is groceries and household goods but sells alcohol as an added service.  It should also be noted that, under the current arrangements, 75% of pubs fall within the two lowest bands and pay &euro;505 or less, as against the &euro;1,500 currently payable by the off-trade.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, and in the context of the Report of the Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, I have asked my officials to examine the proposal in the context of this year's Finance Bill.</p></reply>

Not all Revenue interventions take the form of formal audits or investigations and in accordance with their risk-based approach cases are selected for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators. Each Revenue intervention is intended to be in the form which is most efficient in terms of time and resources, and which imposes the least cost on the taxpayer, whilst addressing the perceived risk and consequently Revenue carries out Risk Management Interventions, which take the form of Aspect Queries and Profile Interviews.</p><p>  Revenue's objective in case working is to ensure that each case (taxpayer or business) is fully compliant with their legal obligations in relation to the keeping of proper books and records, the timely and accurate submission of required declarations and the prompt payment of tax and duty liabilities.  This approach ensures that, as far as possible, the self-assessment system operates effectively and minimises instances of fraud or mistake.    </p><p>  The selection of cases in which to intervene is a critical step in Revenue's compliance programme and case selection derives from a variety of sources.  In addition to specific projects like the shadow economy project, Revenue also uses extensive third party data, good citizens' reports and other intelligence to drive its compliance interventions.  In the past two years, Revenue has also been using advanced analytics to help it identify indicators of fraud or error from taxpayer's filings and they are regarded as a leading tax administration in the deployment of these technologies. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the results from all the various projects undertaken by Revenue are reflected in the general audit and compliance results from audits, assurance checks, and other risk management interventions which are published in Revenue's Annual Report.  The high level of success in securing settlements is a reflection of the targeted approach used by Revenue which is to focus its compliance resources on the areas of greatest risk. An associated strategy is to minimise the number of contacts with compliant taxpayers.  I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners have a very clear focus to target and confront those who do not comply, as set out in their Statement of Strategy.</p></reply>

Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at   .</p><p>  Many distressed borrowers with debts from more than one lender may have to deal with each lender on an individual basis in order to deal with an overall indebtedness problem.  It is recognised that this can cause a difficulty in dealing with an overall unsustainable debt situation.  In view of this, in May 2013 the Central Bank commenced a pilot process to facilitate a voluntary agreement for the restructuring of secured and unsecured distressed debt cases which involve more than one lender.  The aim of the pilot framework was to achieve, with the voluntary agreement of all lenders, a sustainable and fair debt restructuring outcome to an unsustainable debt situation. In particular, it sought to promote and enhance cooperation between lenders in order to resolve an individual's overall distressed debt position.  This multi-debt pilot scheme, which was facilitated by the Central Bank, included the main mortgage lenders and credit unions.  The pilot scheme has now come to an end with case referrals to the scheme operator ceasing on 31 December last.  Data from the pilot is in the process of being compiled and analysed and a report on the pilot is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.</p><p>  Of course, if a borrower is unable to secure voluntary agreement from his creditors (either on an individual or co-ordinated basis) to address an overall unsustainable debt position, the Personal Insolvency Act now provides a statutory mechanism, outside of judicial bankruptcy, that will require all relevant creditors to consider, in an orderly and holistic manner, a formal proposal from a debtor to address an insolvent position.  In that context, the Personal Insolvency Arrangement framework was specifically designed to deal with secured and also any unsecured debt the borrower may have, and if the debtor's proposed arrangement is accepted by the necessary majority of creditors it will then be binding on all relevant creditors.</p></reply>

On 24 September 2012, I made the necessary commencement order to give effect to this recommendation.</p><p>  Following consultation by the Central Bank with credit unions, a Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions has been introduced, which requires that credit unions ensure that individuals who take up key board and management positions are fit and proper. The Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions prescribes two Pre-Approval Controlled Functions (PCFs) in credit unions: the office of chair of the board of the credit union and the office of manager of the credit union. The prior approval of the Central Bank is required before an individual can be appointed to a PCF role. The individual must complete an online Individual Questionnaire which is endorsed by the proposing credit union and then submitted electronically to the Central Bank for assessment.</p><p>  Individual Questionnaires are assessed within the Central Bank with input from the relevant credit union supervisors from the Registry of Credit Unions. Requests for further information may be issued and/or an interview may be requested. If the Central Bank refuses to approve a PCF application, this decision may be appealed to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>  The Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions is being implemented in two phases. The first phase commenced on 1 August 2013 and introduced fitness and probity requirements for credit unions with total assets of greater than &euro;10m. The second phase will commence on 1 August 2015 when all remaining credit unions will be brought within the scope of the regime. Transitional arrangements will apply for the implementation of each phase of the regime.</p><p>  The Commission on Credit unions also highlighted the importance of volunteers to the success of the credit union movement. The Commission Report states that the difficulty in recruiting volunteers could be addressed through a planned effort by credit unions to seek-out potential candidates with the necessary levels of skill and commitment. Greater use of succession plans and volunteer development strategies are recommended. The Commission on Credit Unions Implementation Group in conjunction with the credit union representative bodies have looked at this issue and updated volunteer strategies in line with the Commission recommendations are in place. These strategies are to be reviewed later this year to access their effectiveness.</p><p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that staff employed in the Registry of Credit Unions have a range of backgrounds including accounting, economics, legal and compliance.  The Registry of Credit Unions ensures on appointment that all staff are suitably qualified for their role.</p></reply>

Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.  EU VAT law does not allow for the introduction of an exemption from VAT on the supply of defibrillators.</p><p>  The Irish VAT code provides for the refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of new medical appliances or instruments valued in excess of &euro;25,390, by a person who donates the medical appliances/equipment to a hospital.  However, the purchase of defibrillators in this case by first responders would not qualify for this VAT refund.</p></reply>

Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally. There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the agencies concerned in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.  In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.</p><p>  Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade. Details of the quantities of cigarettes and tobacco seized each year since 2010 are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th> -</th><th>Cigarettes</th><th> -</th><th> -</th><th>Tobacco</th><th> -</th></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Seizures</td><td>Quantity (Million)</td><td> -</td><td>Seizures</td><td>Quantity (Kgs)</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>9,026</td><td>178.4</td><td> -</td><td>1,171</td><td>3,367</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>10,581</td><td>109.1</td><td> -</td><td>1,500</td><td>11,158</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>8108</td><td>95.6</td><td> -</td><td>1,395</td><td>5,277</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>5,797</td><td>40.8</td><td> -</td><td>1,085</td><td>4,453</td></tr></table></p><p>  The quantity of cigarettes seized in a given year can be influenced significantly by the occurrence of a particularly large seizure or seizures, and the quantity of cigarettes seized in 2013 must be viewed against the background of a number of very large seizures in the preceding years. I understand also that Revenue participate actively in multilateral controlled deliveries of smuggled cigarettes and tobacco, resulting in the seizure of the illicit tobacco products in other jurisdictions before they reach Ireland.</p><p>  I am advised that the quantity of cigarettes seized has declined in most EU Member States over the last number of years, and that this reflects, in considerable part, a changed modus operandi adopted by the organised crime gangs that are responsible for a large element of the illegal trade. There has been a movement from large consignments in containers to smaller consignments in deeper concealment within groupage loads, and these can be more difficult to detect. The Revenue Commissioners and their counterparts in other EU Member States are working together to combat this form of smuggling and to ensure that the disruptive effect of seizures on the illegal trade is maximised.</p><p>  In relation to staff numbers I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, that they are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on customs work or on policing illegal cigarette smuggling. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance.

The Deputy will be aware an agreement has now been reached with the IBOA in this regard. AIB included the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual along with other changes including an increase in working hours which were agreed with the IBOA last July. Permanent tsb focused on the wind-up of the defined benefit pension scheme for all staff who were members of this scheme and this has now been completed.</p><p>  For clarity, senior management in the banks have made the following contributions: in the case of Bank of Ireland the proposed pension changes affect all staff in the BSPF scheme including the Chief Executive. In the case of AIB reductions in pay and benefits of higher earners ranging from 7.5% to 15% were implemented in the second half of 2012 and it also should be noted that the members of the AIB Leadership Team all joined the bank since 2008 and receive reduced pension contributions when compared with their predecessors. In the case of ptsb all senior management joined the bank since 2008 and are on lower remuneration levels than their predecessors.</p></reply>

Moody's cited two reasons for the upgrade: </p><p>1. the growth potential of the Irish economy, which together with ongoing fiscal consolidation is expected to bring government debt ratios down; and </p><p>2. the Irish Government's exit from its EU/IMF supported programme on schedule, with improved solvency and restored market access. </p><p>  Ireland is now at investment grade with all five credit rating agencies and this will attract investors which had hitherto been unable to buy Irish government debt due to their mandates.  As a result of the recent upgrade by Moody's, some Asian and Middle-Eastern investors, along with others in Europe including insurance companies, are likely to be in a position to consider investing in Irish Government debt in future.  Market reaction to the Moody's announcement has been positive.</p><p>  The announcement by Fitch Ratings on 21 February 2014 affirming its rating has had no impact on Ireland's government bond yields and, in fact, there has been a modest rally since then.  It is clear that Ireland has rebounded from the bottom of the 'ratings cycle'.  There is a view that the credit rating agencies are catching up on the market in terms of their increasingly positive view of Ireland.</p><p>  On 7 January 2014 the National Treasury Management Agency issued a new 10-year bond by syndication.  The new &euro;3.75 billion benchmark bond was priced at a spread of 166 basis points over the 10-year German bund at a yield of 3.543%. </p><p>  Although the order book amounted to &euro;14 billion, the NTMA decided to limit the size of the new bond to &euro;3.75 billion in order to leave capacity for bond auctions in its funding programme for 2014.  Some 400 investors participated in the transaction with the largest share of demand coming from abroad, particularly pan-European and US real money accounts.  There was notable demand from the UK (26%) and Nordic regions (15%) as well as the US (14%), with strong support from the domestic investor base (17%).  49% of the take-up was from fund managers with banks comprising 27% and pension funds 10%.</p><p>  This transaction is part of the process of normalising Ireland's market access   it was necessary to demonstrate that Ireland had full market access having exited the EU/IMF programme.  The intensive investor relations programme made it possible to bring the new 10-year bond to the market at very short notice   it had been made clear to investors that the NTMA intended issuing early in 2014.</p><p>  The successful execution of a scheduled series of bond auctions would complete the process of market normalisation.  The NTMA's working plan for 2014 is to raise a total of around &euro;8 billion, as prefunding for 2015, the remainder of which it is intended to be raised by way of a series of auctions, commencing on 13 March, involving the NTMA's network of Primary Dealers.</p><p>   In 2013, the NTMA issued &euro;2.5 billion of the existing 5-year benchmark bond by syndication at a yield of 3.32% in January and then in March sold &euro;5 billion of a new 10-year benchmark bond by syndication at a yield of 4.15%. This was the first new 10-year benchmark issuance since January 2010, prior to Ireland's entry into the EU/IMF programme.</p><p>  Regular auctions of short-term Treasury Bills, which resumed in July 2012, continued throughout 2013 with eight auctions during the year.  Each auction raised &euro;500 million of 3-month money at an average annualised yield of 0.2%.  The next Treasury Bill auction is scheduled to take place on 20 March 2014.</p></reply>

I welcome this voluntary agreement which will ensure that mortgage holders in arrears will continue to be serviced in line with the CCMA and the customers will continue to be protected by the code in the event that these bidders acquire the loan book.</p><p>  I have been advised that there are a total of 4,175 Private Dwelling House mortgages that are in arrears in IBRC.  Of these 78% are co-operating with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  The Special Liquidators have restructured 38% of these MARP PDH Accounts and 6% are in the final stages of completion.  The Special Liquidators are working towards a solution with 42% of these MARP PDH Accounts which, with borrower co-operation, they will endeavour to deal with before the sales process completes.   The Special Liquidators do not currently have sufficient information to devise a solution in respect of 14% of these MARP PDH Accounts however further information is being requested from the borrowers with a view to working towards a solution.  Any acquirer of the IBRC loan book will be obliged to honor the terms of these restructured agreements entered into by IBRC.</p><p>  Discussion are continuing between my officials and officials in the Central Bank in relation to the application of the CCMA to entities that are not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The application of the code by unregulated entities is a positive development and is in the best interests of both borrower and lenders.  However, as I have previously stated, if it becomes evident that the voluntary application of the code is not delivering the requisite protections for mortgage holders in arrears, I will bring forward the required legislation.</p></reply>

This includes provision for the establishment of special classes for pupils with SSLD in primary schools. Applications to establish such classes are considered by the school's assigned Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) and those meeting the criteria for establishment are approved by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  Special classes may also be discontinued by the NCSE where the need no longer exists.  The criteria for enrolment in a Special Class for pupils with SSLD is set out in my Department's Circular 0038/2007. </p><p>  A full-time teacher is assigned to each class, and classes operate with a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 7:1. In addition, an enhanced capitation grant is provided to schools operating special classes for pupils with SSLD. Speech and Language Therapy services are provided to these classes by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  A minimum number of five eligible pupils is required for a school to retain a SSLD class. Eligible pupils may spend up to two years in such classes.  Pupils who are not enrolled in a special class for SSLD and who meet the criteria for Specific Speech and Language Disorder, as outlined in my Department's Circular, may qualify for additional teaching support where he/she is enrolled in mainstream school. There are currently no plans to cut the provision of resource teaching hours for the coming school year.</p><p>  Pupils with mild speech and language difficulties may qualify for supplementary teaching support from within the school's general allocation of learning support/teaching support.  All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model (GAM) to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs.  It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils. Schools are guided by Department Circular 02/05 in the effective deployment of these resources.</p><p>  Schools will shortly be requested by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to submit their applications to the NCSE for Resource Teaching support for pupils with special educational needs, for the 2014/15 school year, by 26th March, 2014.</p><p>  The NCSE intend to advise school of their resource teaching allocations for low incidence special needs for the school year 2014/2015, by the end of May 2014.  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the provision of health supports, including Speech and Language Therapy services, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive and concerns in relation to this particular issue should be directed to that body.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published in January.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less.  The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012.  The final phase of the budget measure takes effect from September 2014.</p><p>  An appeals process is available to small schools which have had their staff number reduced as a result of the budget measure.  A school with four classroom teachers or less which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional teacher as a result of the Budget 2012 measure can submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  Circular 0007/2014 provides the criteria under which schools can make an appeal.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. </p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.</p></reply>

Where any resources become available they will be required to assist with the introduction of new specifications at Leaving Certificate which will have new examination components e.g. practical examinations in the sciences etc. This will require significant involvement of the SEC.  It is not intended that into the short to medium term that there will be any loss of jobs in the SEC. In fact the role of SEC will be central to all the reforms envisaged both at junior cycle and senior cycle.</p></reply>

This is a strategic approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  The CFRAM Studies are comprehensive catchment-based studies through which, following public consultation, detailed flood maps are produced and flood risk management measures are assessed and taken to outline design.  These measures will be prioritised and set out in a Flood Risk Management Plan. More information on the Programme is available on .</p><p>  The River Liffey is being assessed as part of the Eastern CFRAM study and the main trunk of the river from Poulaphouca down to the sea, through Dublin City, is being modelled, including a number of tributaries.  The areas of significant flood risk, described within the Programme as  Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs), along the main trunk which are being assessed in detail are Newbridge, Clane, Celbridge, Leixlip, Lucan to Chapelizod, and Dublin.  Under the study the flood maps are based on the conditions in the river as surveyed, and so include the existing river bed levels.  Culverts, etc, are modelled as unblocked (ie clear of debris).  As part of the study, it is intended to undertake a high level screening exercise to identify culverts at high potential risk of blockage by debris.

Each Audit Committee is required to</p><p>-  Operate under a written charter</p><p>-  Have significant external representation (at least 2 members), including, in the normal course, representatives from the private sector with appropriate expertise.  The chairperson of the Committee should come from outside the Department or Office.</p><p>-  Prepare an annual report to the Accounting Officer reviewing its operations.</p><p>-  Invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, or his nominee, to meet the Committee at least once a year.</p><p>   The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the development of internal audit policy for Government Departments and Offices and is currently preparing an Audit Committee Guidance document to provide clarity on the role of the Audit Committee, and to define and promote best practice.

The MOU provides them with a one-year window of opportunity for migrating their applications and hardware to a more modern and supported operating system.  Any agency availing of this agreement must develop a plan to migrate from the affected products before the expiration of the agreement in order to ensure they will no longer be at risk.  There will be no additional vote allocation or central fund created to meet this cost, it must be met by individual agencies from their existing budgets.  Only the agency involved would be able to provide details on why they have  failed to upgrade in advance of the April deadline.</p></reply>

The Tribunal is one of the front-line services directly affected by the current turbulence in the labour market.  The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation/decision.  I am informed that the waiting period for a hearing date at the Tribunal at the end of January 2014 in the region in question is 76 weeks.  This is a reduction of 5 weeks over the past year.  </p><p>  I understand that the Tribunal targets those areas with the longest waiting periods and highest level of claims outstanding, within the resources it has currently available. The Tribunal has been pro-active in driving efficiencies. Divisions of the Tribunal are sitting longer, hearing more cases per hearing and seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency.  As part of the drive for efficiencies, the Tribunal streams cases that are envisaged to be more straight-forward. In this context the number of cases awaiting a hearing date in the region under question has been reduced in the past year by 27% and this includes new cases arising.  </p><p>  I understand that if the person in question believes that they have significant grounds to support an application, they may apply to a sitting Division of a Tribunal to have their case heard at an early date.  This is done by completing a form available from the EAT Secretariat, having given appropriate notice to the opposing parties and appearing before a Division of the Tribunal to set out the reasons as to why this case should be expedited and heard before other cases, which were received ahead of the case in question. It will be a matter for that Division to grant or refuse the application.  However, I would like to draw to the Deputy's attention that the policy of the Tribunal is to only grant such applications where circumstances of extreme urgency exist. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT to reduce backlogs and waiting times for hearings, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons why I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies.  My objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.</p><p>  A new two-tier Workplace Relations structure will be established comprising two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five (i.e. the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court). This will comprise of a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.</p><p>  The preparation of the legislation which will give effect to the new workplace relations structures is at an advanced stage.  My intention is to publish the Workplace Relations Bill as early as possible during the Spring/Summer D&aacute;il session 2014 with a view to having the new structures in place during 2014.</p></reply>

While these discussions have yet to conclude, I hope to be in a position to bring forward legislative proposals in the near future. </p><p>  It has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.

The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 5<sup>th</sup> November 2013.   It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought from the Department of Social Protection.

Responsibility for delivery of this initiative rests with the individual county and/or city council.

The person concerned has been notified of the arrangements for the hearing. </p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  </p><p>  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals. </p><p>  These measures have led to a significant improvement in appeal processing times. The average processing time for all appeals peaked in 2011 at 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.  In 2012, processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing was 39.5 weeks while there was a slight increase to 27.8 weeks for a summary decision.  This improvement continued in 2013 to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>  In addition to improved processing times, the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office has also increased as a result of these measures from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  The number of appeals finalised in 2013 has also increased by 5,863 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 14,077 at 24th  February 2014.</p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

Interested applicants should contact the Craft Council of Ireland for further information on how to participate in this pilot initiative.</p><p>  If an individual has any queries relating to the operation of the JobBridge Scheme, they may contact the JobBridge team via the Contact Us section of the JobBridge website </p></reply>

Their purpose is to help protect the future social insurance entitlements of insured persons by providing cover during periods when paid PRSI contributions are not due. </p><p>  To qualify for unemployment credits, a person must be available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking such work, and customers are obliged to demonstrate this on an ongoing basis.  Legislation provides that, where a person has no paid or credited contributions for a period of two consecutive years, they will not be awarded credits until they have a further 26 weeks of paid PRSI contributions. </p><p>  Where a person makes an application for unemployment credits retrospectively, they must show good cause for the failure to claim at the relevant time. In this context, a statement that the reason for the delay was due solely to a lack of knowledge may not be considered sufficient to warrant an award of credits on &lsquo;good cause&rsquo; grounds.  </p><p>  In addition, in circumstances where retrospective award of credits was being sought for a considerable period, there would be a considerable onus on the customer to demonstrate that they had satisfied all of the conditions during the period concerned and, in particular, to show that they had been available for full-time employment and had been making all reasonable efforts to find suitable full-time work on an ongoing basis throughout the period concerned.</p><p>  In relation to the above, customers are advised to apply at their social welfare local office/Intreo office in order to ensure that their application is examined and to receive a formal decision on their claim. </p></reply>

I have been equally pleased by the enormous community and voluntary interest in marking this anniversary.  Although funding is very much constrained, I am pleased to have been able to support events with a national impact, including the National Museum of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin in their arrangements for joint exhibitions entitled: <i>&quot;Emperor of the Irish: Brian Bor&uacute; and the Battle of Clontarf, 1014&quot; </i>and <i>&quot;Clontarf 1014: Brian Bor&uacute; and the Battle for Dublin April to December 1014&quot;. </i>  I have also been pleased to support the Clontarf leg of the 'National Heritage Trail' development. These national-level developments, along with focused support from the National Gallery and organisations, including Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, for commemorative events represent a significant commitment from my Department to the programme. </p><p>  I welcome the service being planned and I am supportive generally of the project mentioned.

The Naomh &Eacute;anna has been moored at Grand Canal Dock since 1989 when it was found to no longer meet health and safety requirements to operate as a passenger-carrying vessel. Unfortunately, the ship has deteriorated substantially in the past 20 years and presents a real risk in the Grand Canal Basin, in the heart of Dublin's Docklands. In April 2013, a report on the hull condition of the vessel, commissioned by its owners, highlighted serious safety concerns. Based on the report&rsquo;s findings, the Irish Nautical Trust issued a &lsquo;<i>Notice to Vacate</i>  &rsquo; to both of the businesses that had been operating from the vessel.</p><p>  I am advised that very significant investment would be required to preserve the already unstable hull of the vessel and to bring the vessel to the point where it would be safe and insurable. I am further advised that the vessel's owners do not have the financial resources to deal with these issues.</p><p>  In the circumstances, Waterways Ireland offered to arrange for the removal and disposal of the ship on behalf of the Irish Nautical Trust.  Waterways Ireland made this offer as the property owners of the Grand Canal Dock because of the continuing serious risk posed by the condition of the Naomh &Eacute;anna, the disruption and expense that would be involved were it to sink in the Grand Canal Dock and the absence of any firm indication that the very significant level finance required to make it safe and insurable was potentially available. The Irish Nautical Trust accepted the offer and confirmed its approval to Waterways Ireland to dispose of the vessel on its behalf.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that as the vessel is not in the ownership of my Department or Waterways Ireland, it would not be appropriate for me to provide an opportunity to publicly consult with groups and individuals to address their issues and ideas on the action that could be taken to restore the vessel. However, as I advised the Seanad on 26<sup>th</sup> February, interested individuals or groups who wish to restore the vessel now have until 31<sup>st</sup>  March to come up with a realistic proposal. Any such proposal would have to be based on a credible, definitive business plan with access to the required finance. In that regard, I must re-iterate that there is no question of State funding being made available, nor in view of the serious safety issues posed by the Naomh &Eacute;anna will it be feasible to delay action to deal with those issues beyond that timeframe.</p></reply>

The proposed bye-laws are intended to support the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the Royal and Grand Canals and on the Barrow system. The objective is to enhance Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s ability to manage, care for and maintain these waterways. This will help to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users. </p><p>  The proposed new bye-laws provide for the management of house boats, defined as a boat on the canals which is being used as the sole or principal residence of the owner or an occupant with the owner&rsquo;s permission, as well as for extended moorings and residential moorings. An Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit will be required for a houseboat not navigating or continuously cruising the canals.  The permit will allow the use of a mooring identified by Waterways Ireland on the canals where the houseboat may moor for more than five days and up to one year.</p><p>  The proposed bye-laws will also modernise the charging regime. There will also be further provision for the care, management, maintenance and control and the regulation of the use of the canals, moorings on the canals, and their use by the public for recreation and navigation purposes.</p><p>  I am advised that all submissions received during the consultation process on the draft bye-laws will be given due consideration by Waterways Ireland, following which a report on the outcome of the process will be prepared.  That report will be forwarded to my Department and will then be referred to me, with recommendations for consideration and final decision. As I indicated in response to a debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann yesterday, I will afford interested Deputies and Senators an opportunity to discuss the proposals with me prior to making the final decision.</p></reply>

The CER continues to regulate the supply tariff for Bord G&aacute;is Energy&rsquo;s (BGE) domestic customers. All other segments of the gas market have been deregulated and price setting by the other four gas suppliers operating in the domestic market is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned. While I have no statutory function in the setting of gas prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market, I am acutely conscious of the impact of energy prices on citizens across Ireland. </p><p>  The Government is most concerned at the impact of higher gas prices on consumers. It is regrettably the case that Ireland is largely at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of gas. My focus is on those elements of energy costs over which policy can exercise some control.</p><p>  The most meaningful measure is to continue to improve the thermal efficiency of people&rsquo;s homes and thus insulate them from the effects of rising energy costs. Energy efficiency measures are available free of charge to households in energy poverty to cover the cost of retrofitting their homes under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme. Since the launch of the scheme, more than 105,000 households have received free upgrades. </p><p>  In total, around one sixth of all homes in Ireland have received some form of Government supported energy efficiency upgrade to date. More than &euro;57 million euro has been allocated to fund efficiency grant programmes in 2014. This will lead to another 12,000 low-income homes receiving a free energy efficiency upgrade this year.</p><p>  I am also continuing to work with the CER and energy suppliers to ensure that Pay As You Go meters are available to those customers in financial difficulty.</p></reply>

Oversight of the NEEAP is provided by the NEEAP Implementation Group, chaired by my Department. The Group evaluated the range of actions outlined by NEEAP   and the Plan is due to be updated later this year. As of end 2012, Ireland had achieved 11,419 GWh energy savings, which represents 36% of the national target to 2020. A revised NEEAP, in accordance with EU requirements, will be published later in the year.</p><p>The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. The Directive requires that Member States set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) their trajectories towards meeting these targets and the measures to be taken to achieve these targets. Ireland's NREAP provides that 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power be produced from renewable sources. The first progress report on Ireland's NREAP was submitted in January 2012 and the second progress report, covering the years 2011 and 2012, was submitted to the European Commission earlier this month. The report highlights that in 2012 7.1% of our overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources which is up from 6.5% in 2011.</p></reply>

To that end, I have asked the Internet Content Governance Advisory (ICGA) Group which I formed in December, to evaluate the full range of content issues that now arise online. </p><p>  This Group will consider the emerging issues around online content and its general impact on the lives of children and young people, including online bullying or harassment as well as the issues that arise from age inappropriate viewing of content. </p><p>  The Group will report in May with the objective of making recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without limiting unduly their opportunities and rights online. The Government will consider that report in great detail at that stage. A public consultation is now open, and submissions from all interested parties are welcome. I am aware also that the Group expect to meet with all key stakeholders as part of their work in the coming weeks.</p><p>  The Group will also have regard to international best practice, including recent European Commission Reports and Council Conclusions in this area, and will also be asked to comment specifically on the recent report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee titled &lsquo;Addressing the Growth of Social Media and tackling Cyberbullying&rsquo;.</p><p>Our most immediate and important task now is to help educate children, young people and parents as to the risks that can be found online, to support parents and teachers in explaining these issues to children and to identify the optimal technical solution to protect children. In this regard, there are a range of tools available online to assist parents in managing internet access. The ISPs themselves have a variety of measures and resources already in place, with software and other tools available to help parents ensure online safety for their children.</p></reply>

The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly , those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers.  It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition.  In December 2013, my Department wrote to local authorities seeking proposals for funding support under the SRF and the deadline for receipt of applications is 28 February 2014.  Submissions will then be evaluated by my Department in accordance with the criteria that have been circulated to the local authorities and funding allocations made to local authorities as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>  Factors likely to be taken into account in the assessment of proposals include the quality and clarity of the funding proposal, the extent to which the development will be resolved within the SRF timeframe, the level of additional private sector finance being leveraged, the wider economic benefit of the proposal, and the community gain arising.  My Department will support SRF proposals capable of delivering significant and lasting impact in relation to the quality of the resolution process itself and improved conditions for residents.  It is hoped that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.</p></reply>

This latter provision is, however, subject to the following qualifications:<blockquote>- that the planning authority is satisfied that there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the Regional Planning Guidelines for the area of the planning authority since the date of the permission such that the development would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area;<br /><br />- that the planning authority is satisfied that the development would not be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28, notwithstanding that they were so issued after the date of the grant of permission in relation to which an application is made under this section; and/or<br /><br />- that the planning authority is satisfied where the development has not commenced, that an environmental impact assessment, or an appropriate assessment, or both of those assessments, if required, was or were carried out before the permission was granted.</blockquote>  Where the development which has been granted permission is now deemed to be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to Ministerial guidelines subsequently issued, it is not possible to address this matter by further information, as the development which has been granted permission cannot be altered post the grant of permission.  However, it is of course open to the person concerned to re-apply for permission with a plan or design that complies with current guidelines or the current Development Plan.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake this metering programme.  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water will be responsible for the collection of water charges from households and also provides that responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, be assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p><p>  As the metering programme will still be underway when charges are introduced, an appropriate approach to charging customers who are not metered at that stage will be put in place.  This will be structured in such a way as to ensure that it represents a reasonable proxy for usage and is fair.  The CER has indicated that in April 2014 it will be carrying out a number of public consultation s including the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties.  The CER will announce its decision on the approved level of water charges in August 2014.</p><p>  Households served by private wells will not be metered as part of the metering programme and will not be subject to water charges by Irish Water.</p></reply>

Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering is, in the first instance, a matter for local authorities.  A range of penalties exist under the Acts, including an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment.</p><p>  In addition, as Minister, I encourage a multi-faceted approach to tackling the litter problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education.   My Department supports several anti-litter initiatives to combat litter in Ireland, including:<blockquote>- National Spring Clean;<br /><br />- Green Schools Programme;<br /><br />- Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) &ndash; Litter League<br /><br />- Tidy Towns;<br /><br />- Local Authority Anti-Litter &amp;amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme; and<br /><br />- Negotiated agreements with the banking and chewing gum industries.</blockquote>  Given the range of existing penalties and the diverse policy approaches in place, I have no current plans to amend the Litter Pollution Acts.  Strong enforcement of the existing code and continued efforts to raise awareness of the litter problem and educate our young people are key to effecting a long-term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal.   Ultimately, it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter.</p></reply>

In addition to the comprehensive open consultation undertaken by my Department in 2012, the Oireachtas Joint Committee facilitated a round of stakeholder engagement on the final policy analysis report from the Secretariat to the National Social and Economic Council and the outline Heads of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill which I released in February 2013.  I am now considering the Joint Committee&rsquo;s report, as well as a range of other issues, with a view to finalising the draft Heads of the Bill as soon as possible.  Subject to the approval of Government, my intention is to publish the final Heads before Easter 2014.</p><p>  In anticipation of the planned primary legislation, a National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050 is now being developed. At present, Departments with responsibility for the key sectors in the national transition agenda are currently preparing the sectoral elements for incorporation into the national roadmap.  The key sectors are electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture.  To ensure that the roadmapping process is inclusive, informed and transparent, the public has already been invited, by the Departments concerned, to input to the sectoral work on electricity generation, agriculture and transport.  A public consultation paper on the built environment, which is being developed jointly by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is at an advanced stage and will be issued for consultation shortly.  Feedback through these sectoral consultations will input into the key sectoral contributions to the first draft National Low-Carbon Roadmap which I intend to release, together with a draft Strategic Environment Assessment, for a substantial period of open consultation later this year. My intention is to ensure that the first draft national roadmap will be informed and technically sound, and provide a solid basis for a constructive, transparent and inclusive open debate.</p><p>  In parallel to the mitigation agenda, the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, which I issued in December 2012 , provides for the development and implementation of sectoral and local adaptation action plans, involving extensive stakeholder consultation and engagement, which will form part of a comprehensive national response to the impacts of climate change.  Under the framework, sectoral plans will be developed by the relevant Government Department or Agency and adopted by the relevant Minister.  Draft sectoral plans are due to be published by mid-2014, and details of the lead Departments and Agencies are set out in section 4 of the Framework.  Local adaptation action planning will be undertaken by local authorities through the spatial planning process, with full engagement of key stakeholders, which provides an established means through which to implement and integrate climate change objectives, including adaptation, at local level.</p></reply>

The new regulations are necessary following the widespread instances of failure by owners, designers and builders to comply with their statutory obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 to design and construct buildings in accordance with the building regulations.</p><p>  Every effort has been made to ensure that arrangements are in place for a successful transition to the new building control arrangements on and from 1 March 2014.  The new online Building Control Management System (BCMS) has been developed to provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector.  Briefing and guidance on the new system has been provided for local authority staff and representatives of the key construction sector professional bodies and the Construction Industry Federation in recent weeks.  The definitive <i>Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works,</i> was circulated to industry stakeholders on 7 February 2014.</p><p>  Standard forms of contracts used for both private and public sector projects fall to be revised to reflect the new regulatory environment.

Briefing and guidance is available within Government and within the private sector to deal with contractual challenges and procurement issues that will inevitably arise as change takes place.</p><p>  The above measures (i.e. the BCMS, the Code of Practice and guidance on contracting matters) are the key supports necessary to ensure the new regulatory arrangements can work well in practice.  As local authorities and industry now move to full implementation, my Department will continue to work with all concerned to ensure that they understand their obligations and the steps necessary to meet them.</p></reply>

The powers to enforce the statutory requirements arising under the Fire Safety Act, the Building Control Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be at issue in relation to a situation where apartments are defective, are vested in the relevant local authority. Neither I nor my Department have a direct role or responsibility in relation to the exercise of these statutory responsibilities.  I have asked that local authorities use the powers that are available to them wherever reasonable and appropriate in order to assist homeowners who, through no fault of their own find that their home is defective.  I am aware that Dublin City Council has been of assistance previously in this regard in relation to problems in this estate which have now largely been addressed as outlined in the reply to Question No. 149 of 23 October 2013.</p><p>  In the absence of any specific information in relation to the nature of the defects referred to in the question, it should be noted that the Building Control Act 1990 clearly places responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations on the owner of the building concerned and on the builder/developer who carries out the works.  The Building Regulations set out the legally enforceable minimum standards which a new building must achieve.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is primarily the responsibility of the local Building Control Authorities who have strong powers to serve enforcement notices for non-compliance or to institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements within a period of five years from the date the building has been completed.  Homeowners should be advised to report any concerns about non-compliance with the Building Regulations to the local Building Control Authority.  The details supplied do not indicate whether the builder/developer was a member of any structural guarantee warranty/scheme, such as that provided by HomeBond, and this should be ascertained and pursued if relevant.</p><p>  Remediation of <b>defects</b> is a matter between the parties concerned, the owner and the builder/developer and their insurers.  If satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved through dialogue and negotiation, it may be appropriate to consider the option of seeking civil legal remedy.</p></reply>

Section 5 of the Act also sets out the share structure of Irish Water, providing for one share to be allocated to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and for the remaining shares to be issued equally between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, which came into effect on 1 January 2014, provides for the transfer of responsibility for the delivery of water services from the water services authorities to Irish Water. Section 46 of this Act provides for amendments to section 5 of the Water Services Act 2013.  The amended provision precludes the three above-mentioned shareholders of Irish Water from alienating the shares issued to them.  This amendment essentially places a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water.</p></reply>

This is a considerable improvement on July last year when processing times had reached 14 weeks.  I should also point out that that the number of vetting applications received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) each year has risen from 187,864 in 2007 to 381,082 by the end of 2013. </p><p>  Of course processing times will fluctuate upwards and downwards depending on seasonal demands and volumes received and, in some cases, depending on whether further enquiries have to be conducted with external Garda Stations or other agencies such as the Courts Service, Probation Service, HSE, etc.  These enquiries are conducted for a multiplicity of reasons such as verification of identity, updating of incomplete records, and establishing outcomes of investigations. </p><p>  Nonetheless, I am committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to perform this most essential of tasks.  In that regard, the Garda Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 174 whole-time equivalent staff (170 civilians and 4 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU).  To put this in perspective, this represents an 87% increase on the staffing level at the end of December 2012 when 93 staff were assigned to the GCVU. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the development of an e-Vetting solution is well under way.  This will facilitate the processing of applications in an e-format, thus removing the current time-consuming process of manually managing applications received and will result in a streamlining of the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction.</p></reply>

The bed capacity of 6 prisons have been aligned with the Inspector of Prisons' recommended figures, namely, Mountjoy Male, Dochas, St. Patrick's, Portlaoise, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey.  In addition, in Cork Prison the bed capacity has been reduced from 290 to 210 and in Limerick prison the male capacity has been reduced from 290 to 220. </p><p>  As many prisoners as possible released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programmes of temporary release, including the Community Return Programme.</p></reply>

Applicants for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the gravity of the charge or exceptional circumstances, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.</p><p>  The nature of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is that it is demand led, driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and the prosecution of cases through the courts system.  This renders it difficult to predict and control costs.  Since taking office I have however introduced a number of adjustments to the legal aid fees payable under the Scheme.  Regulations introduced in 2011 imposed a reduction of 10% in the fees payable in the District Court.  Fees payable in the Circuit and higher courts were similarly reduced by 10% in line with a reduction in the fees payable by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecution practitioners.  A reduction of 50% was applied to payments in respect of travel and subsistence expenses payable to solicitors in certain circumstances.  There is no entitlement for barristers to claim travel and subsistence expenses under the Scheme.  Expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is monitored on an ongoing basis with a view to identifying any areas where further efficiencies may be achieved.</p><p>  Legal representation under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is provided entirely by solicitors and barristers in private practice who have notified the County Registrars (in the case of solicitors) and my Department (in the case of barristers) of their willingness to be placed on panels for the undertaking of legal aid work.  The Judge who grants legal aid to a defendant assigns to that person a solicitor from the panel.  Where the criminal legal aid certificate permits representation by counsel, a barrister from the panel is instructed at the discretion of the acting solicitor.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>My Department has no involvement in the day to day running of the Scheme, the granting of legal aid or the assignment of lawyers.

The person concerned had permission to remain up to 18th March, 2013.  All non-EEA nationals are required to keep their permission to remain in the State up to date at all times and failure to do so may adversely affect an application for a certificate of naturalisation. If he has not already done so, the person concerned should apply for the renewal of this permission to remain. </p><p>  In addition, I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person concerned. A letter was issued by the citizenship section of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service to the applicant on 9th January 2014 requesting him to submit a current Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) card. </p></reply>

The General Scheme of the Bill is available on my Department's website: <i>www.justice.ie</i>.</p><p>  The objective of the Bill is to update and modernise the general law relating to landlord and tenant by repealing numerous pre-1922 statutes, including the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act Ireland 1860 (commonly known as &quot;Deasy's Act&quot;), as well as statutory provisions of more recent origin and replacing them with a streamlined statutory framework more suited to modern conditions. For example, it will contain provisions which clarify the respective obligations of both landlords and tenants and improve protection levels for tenants. However, since much of the law relating to residential tenancies, including renewal of such tenancies and redress mechanisms, has already been updated in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and later amendments to it, the principal impact of the reforms in the new Bill will be felt in the area of commercial tenancies.</p><p>  I am confident that the reforms set out in the new Bill will reduce legal uncertainty arising from uncertain and obsolete statutes and thereby reduce costly disputes and recourse to litigation.</p><p>  Unfortunately, due to the complex nature of the proposed legislation, I am not in a position to state when the Bill will be published. However, it is my intention to proceed quickly with enactment of the Bill following publication.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the Ombudsman Commission is an independent statutory body.  The Ombudsman Commission, which has been operational since 9 May, 2007, submits an annual report to me each year relating to its activities in the immediate preceding year, in accordance with section 80 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. These reports, which are available on their website (<i>www.gardaombudsman.ie</i>), provide details on the number of complaints, the types of allegations and the outcome of investigations.</p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007 provide for the appointment of an independent Confidential Recipient to whom members of the Force, and civilian support staff, can report, in confidence, instances where they believe there may be corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  The first independent Confidential Recipient was appointed in March 2008.  It is important to note that, as regards the investigation of individual cases, the Confidential Recipient normally liaises directly with the Garda Commissioner, and neither I nor my Department are involved in the process.  Confidential reports are only forwarded to me by the Confidential Recipient in cases where the complaints relate to the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>  Regulation 15(1) of the Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice Regulations 2007, requires the Garda Commissioner to report to me not later than four months after the end of each year in relation to any confidential reports made during that year.  Based on the information provided by the Commissioner the number of confidential reports for each year since 2008 was as follows:<table><tr><th><b>Year</b><b></b></th><th><b>No. of Reports</b></th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2010  </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1</td></tr></table></p><p>  I have publicly said that I do not believe the office of the Confidential Recipient and the legislation applicable to it is fulfilling the objective for which it was established.  I have stated my intention to abolish the office and to enable members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who allege misconduct within the Force to have their complaints considered and addressed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The Cabinet has agreed that an appropriate amendment to the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 should be prepared to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to be prescribed under that Bill as a body to which disclosures may be made by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  Interim arrangements will be made to fill the Post of Confidential Recipient by the appointment of a retired judge.  Every effort will be made to expedite the necessary consultation process so that the appointment can be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p><p>  Tackling organised crime and drug related crime and those engaged in these activities are key functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and indeed are highlighted in the Policing Plan of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2014. Apart form the work of all members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations, the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau operate at the forefront in this matter.</p><p>  The Garda National Drugs Unit, working with other national units, including the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau, target persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  The specific strategies put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to address drug trafficking include:</p><p> - The operation of dedicated Drug Units across the country. Ongoing training programmes for personnel as Divisional Asset Profilers, who have the specific remit of targeting assets of persons who are suspected of being involved in the importation, sale and supply of drugs at local levels;</p><p> - Continued close co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners (Customs Service) in the proactive investigation of persons suspected of being involved in drug-trafficking; and</p><p> - Given the global nature of the drugs trade international law enforcement co-operation remains a key element in the overall response. In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking including in working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as Interpol and Europol and participating in the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics based in Lisbon (MAOC-N).</p><p>  Actions taken against those involved in drug trafficking by our law enforcement agencies is continuing to yield significant results. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advise that overall Garda drug seizures for 2013 are currently estimated to be valued at &euro;67m.</p></reply>

Dedicated committals units have been established in all committal prisons for this purpose.</p><p>  To segregate first time committals from the general prisoner population would greatly reduce their access to services.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services. These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services. On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison. At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited vocational courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Irish Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.

Such monies are paid into the Government&rsquo;s Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment. </p><p>  From time to time, it has been suggested that monies collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau should be used to fund community projects. However, while my Department has previously consulted with the Department of Finance on the matter and it has been accepted that there may be some symbolic value in the suggestion, it is considered problematic and raises a number of practical difficulties.</p><p>  A policy of ring-fencing monies obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of these for a specific purpose runs contrary to the normal Estimates process. While allowing for a small number of very specific targeted exceptions, it is believed that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy. </p><p>  There is also the problem of additional costs which would accrue in the administration of any scheme to divert such funds to local projects and additional administrative costs without any additional revenues being generated.</p><p>  It could also be argued that a significant proportion of the monies secured by the Criminal Assets  Bureau are already owed to the Exchequer as it often relates to non-payment of taxes and social welfare fraud.  </p><p>  In the current economic climate the Exchequer could not sustain a loss of revenue without making compensatory adjustments. If the monies collected were to be diverted to community projects, there would inevitably be implications for any other monies those projects received from the Exchequer. Alternatively, other public expenditure programmes would have to sustain the loss. </p><p>  There are currently no proposals to change the existing arrangements concerning such monies.</p></reply>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services. On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison. At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral. </p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited vocational courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Irish Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.

From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of some 95,000 farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.</p><p>  The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme was reduced from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million and, in order to achieve the necessary saving in expenditure, specific changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012 were introduced. Making these technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria ensured that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme. </p><p>  There was no reduction in the maximum area payable &ndash; 34 hectares. The changes were designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.</p><p>  A robust appeals process was instituted, with those farmers affected by the requirement under the 2012 Scheme to have achieved a minimum stocking density on their holding in 2011 of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare to apply for derogation. This process included initial internal review within my Department, the subsequent right of appeal to the independently-chaired DAS Appeals Committee and thereafter to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p><p>  The number of farmers, who did not meet the 0.3 livestock unit per hectare in 2011 and, who were not eligible for a derogation, was 1,540. These farmers were paid &euro;2.4 million in 2011. </p><p>  Applicants under the 2011 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme were required to have met a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare for a minimum retention period of three consecutive months.</p><p>  Applicants under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme were required to have met (i) a minimum stocking of 0.3 in 2011 and (ii) a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units for a minimum retention period of six consecutive months in 2012.</p></reply>

Despite continued slow demand from some key export markets, prices for prime steers and heifers have remained relatively stable even though the combined kill for these categories has increased by 11% to date in 2014 compared to same period in 2013. While the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to adversely affect demand, the number of young bulls slaughtered at DAFM-approved plants has increased by 58% from 4,200 head in week 1 of 2014 to 6,700 head in week 7.</p><p>  Higher factory throughput is partly a result of cattle becoming fit for slaughter earlier than in previous years leading to a situation whereby factories are giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the trade specifications demanded by their retail customers. The Irish beef industry is highly export dependent and the need to ensure that it is producing efficiently for overseas markets cannot be ignored. Finished cattle prices continue to be impacted by weak demand, particularly for manufacturing beef, in key export markets. One of the main difficulties in marketing young bulls over 16 months at age is that these animals are outside the specifications preferred by the UK market. This is a major disadvantage at present because the UK market has effectively become the highest-priced beef market in the EU.</p><p>  Delays in slaughtering some animals combined with a weakening of prices for those outside market specifications undoubtedly put pressure on producer margins. However, neither I nor any Agriculture Minister can interfere in a trade that is cyclical in nature and prone to short-term price fluctuations. Although I have no function in relation to commercial transactions between the meat factories and their suppliers, I met representatives of both sides in the last week to discuss the current situation. As a result of that interaction, I am hopeful that the factories, in collaboration with the farming bodies, will be able to resolve the various issues that have lately caused difficulties for some producers. At my request, Meat Industry Ireland (MII) member companies will ensure that their livestock offices are open to deal with farmers with any particular queries or concerns on the marketing of their stock.  MII member companies have  made available contact details for each their main plants to enable farmers to phone them directly.</p><p>  The relationship between processors and farmers is an interdependent one. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. The current situation clearly underlines the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain. An industry-led solution to the current uncertainty is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.</p><p>  With regard to the Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) targets, the original goal to increase the output value of the beef sector by 20% was subsequently increased to 40% on the recommendation of the industry-led Beef Activation Group. The various targets under Food Harvest 2020 are monitored and reviewed on a continuous basis by the High Level Implementation Committee which I chair, and any modifications to the strategy for the development of the sector can be made as appropriate.</p><p>  For example earlier this month I announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014. This package will include a &euro;23m for Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the suckler beef sector. It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the 2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.</p></reply>

Kerry. From a maternal point of view the characteristics of the blackface breed has made, and continues to make a significant contribution to the national breeding flock. Over many years various strains of the blackface breed have developed around Ireland in response to specific climatic and environmental conditions unique to certain regions. The Kerry Blackface mountain sheep is one such of example of this, where over many generations, through a combination of natural selection and management the strain has evolved to survive and thrive in the conditions that exist in the Kerry region. </p><p>  I am also aware that there are a number of threats facing the various families of Blackface that exist around the country; these include inbreeding and dilution by other sheep breeds and other strains of blackface mountain sheep. These strains have taken generations to evolve and their essential characteristics can very quickly be undone if incorrect decisions are made by farmers breeding these sheep. </p><p>  If the threats mentioned above are to be overcome by Blackface breeders it is essential that they begin a process of ancestry record keeping as soon as possible. Currently in Ireland there is a very well developed infrastructure funded by my Department to facilitate this process in the form of Sheep Ireland. Sheep Ireland, a sister organisation to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) provides a national sheep database in which Irish ram breeders currently record ancestry and performance data for their flocks. This data proves an invaluable resource to these breeders when making mating decisions each year especially with a view to avoiding any risk of inbreeding, while also helping them to identify genetics that will contribute positively to the performance and profitability of their flock. </p><p>  This national breed improvement programme being operated by Sheep Ireland is open to all interested groups of Blackface ram breeders. Detailed parentage records of lambs born are collected by all participating breeders which over time will provide a valuable database for future use. I would therefore recommend any groups who are concerned for the survival of the mountain blackface breed to engage with Sheep Ireland.</p></reply>

As the catching sector is by definition dependant on being able to go out and catch fish, and crews earn their living through a share of the catch, many fishermen have suffered financially because of this extended period restricted to port.  We have had some breaks in the weather during February and many of the vessels that were harbour bound due to the severe weather were able to return to fishing and to some extent make up for lost time.  No doubt we will continue to have intermittent stormy conditions in the weeks and months ahead, as is normal for this time of year, but I am hopeful that fishermen will be able to put to sea on a regular basis so that they can put that difficult period behind them.</p><p>  On 12 February 2014, I informed the House that as part of its overall co-ordinated response to the impact of the recent unprecedented weather conditions, the Government had decided to allocate an additional &euro;8.8 million for the repair of the publicly owned pier, harbour and slipway network linked to fisheries and aquaculture and to allocate up to &euro;1.5 million to assist inshore fishermen in replacing lobster and shrimp pots lost or destroyed in the storms. In light of the additional funds now available, on 18 February my Department invited applications for funding from Local Authorities in respect of repair to fishery and aquaculture related harbours, piers and slipways damaged in the recent storm events.  In relation to inshore fishermen, BIM has opened for applications a new scheme providing aid of up to &euro;2,400 for the replacement of pots lost in the storms. The Deputy will agree that these are significant interventions in the current economic circumstances and are a clear indication of this Government's commitment to assisting rural coastal communities and the inshore fishing sector with their recovery from the storms.</p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in all sectors who have been unable to work because of adverse weather conditions.  </p><p>  As income from fishing is derived from landings of catch, the amount that can be caught and therefore the income from most fisheries is determined by the EU quotas which are restrictive, and made available under our management arrangements with catch limits set for whitefish each month.   The quotas are managed to allow for access to quota for the full twelve months of the year, as far as possible.  This may mean in many cases that the allocations made available for certain months are set at low levels, certainly less than Industry would like and would be capable of landing.   </p><p>  I always work very closely with, and I am advised by industry when setting catch limits during the year.  Each month, a quota management advisory committee, involving Industry representatives and my Department, meets and examines available quota, uptake levels and the market situation and make recommendations to me on catch limits for the following month.  The quota uptake figures for January 2014 and for the first part of February are significantly down.  In order that vessel owners and their crews are enabled to compensate as early as possible for these low catch levels, allocations for March were set for a number of the key economic stocks at a higher level than in February.   The level recommended by industry took account of concerns not to glut the market with very high landings in a single month and on that basis the arrangements recommended and put in place involve increases in key whitefish stocks including cod, haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea, monkfish and megrim in the Celtic Sea and the hake stock in the Celtic Sea and the north west.  </p><p>  These increased quotas and fishing opportunities for March will help to re-balance the landings to bring them more into line with planned annual spread of quota uptake.  They can be further adjusted in April to take into account of the low level of landings in the first 6 weeks of the year.  </p><p>  The approach adopted by the UK is a matter for that Government and I am not in a position to comment in it.</p></reply>

My commitment is to reduce the level of paperwork, the time needed to fill in applications and as the same time to reduce errors allowing for speedier service delivery.</p><p>  With specific regard to the Direct Aid Schemes, including Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas, which together account for payments in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my department&rsquo;s iNet system is constantly upgraded. There are a variety of benefits in using iNet, including an on-line mapping element, which allows farmers, or their agents, who need to submit maps to the Department, to do so through iNet, thereby dispensing with the need to submit paper maps.In excess of 13,000 maps were submitted online in 2013. Other benefits of iNet include immediate acknowledgement of receipt of applications by my Department, the significant reduction in the ability to make simple clerical errors, due to the built-in system of controls and the ability to view maps and correspondence. In 2013, over 73,000 applications were submitted online, representing a ten-fold increase since iNet was launched.</p><p>  I would urge anyone considering availing of the on-line facility to make enquiries via the website,    or, alternatively, the dedicated Helpdesk at Lo-call 1890 252 118. There is no down-side in registering for on-line either individually, or through an agent, as farmers still retain the right to submit a traditional paper application, should they so choose. However, I am convinced that those who do sign-up will be readily impressed with the systems user-friendliness. </p><p>  I must also refer to the current campaign to encourage more farmers to sign-up for my Department&rsquo;s text messaging service, with a mail campaign having been launched recently. Currently some 70,000 SFP applicants are signed-up this service, which during 2013 was used to advise farmers of the SFP closing date, receipt of individual SFP applications, payments, Nitrates, etc. The benefits are very clear. There is no down-side to the service, so I would strongly urge all those not yet signed-up to do so immediately.</p></reply>

The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations.Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2,   Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;50.530m including &euro;750,000 capital funding has been provided to my Department for these schemes. The capital funding comprises &euro;250,000 for play and recreation initiatives and &euro;500,000 for staff-led youth projects under the various schemes funded by the Youth Affairs Unit of the Department.</p><p>  In 2014, funding of &euro;14.4m has been allocated to the Special Projects for Youth Scheme under which grant aid is made available for out-of-school projects for disadvantaged young people and youth work initiatives for young homeless people, young people at risk of substance misuse and young travellers.</p><p>  The allocations for youth services and schemes, including the Special Projects for Youth Scheme are determined, in the first instance, by my Department having regard to the available budget. My Department in line with Government policy has been required to achieve significant savings on all funding schemes, including the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE). In the determination of the annual allocations for the schemes, my Department, while having regard to the CRE, has sought to ensure that the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are maintained and protected, as far as is possible, from the impact of the necessary reductions in funding. In a context of the very difficult budgetary constraints that have arisen in recent years there have been no new applications for the funding of new projects since 2008.</p><p>  With regard to the future development of provision for young people, my Department is undertaking a comprehensive Value for Money Review of youth funding schemes that support  services to disadvantaged young people. The findings of this review will shape the future direction of youth funding provided by my Department and will aim to ensure quality effective value-for-money services that secure best outcomes for young people. My Department is also developing a new youth strategy. The new youth strategy will take into account the changes in the demographic situation and in the profiles of young people and the evidence about what works best in the provision of youth services to meet young people's needs. It will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p><p>  The Leixlip Youth Project is one of a number of projects operated by Kildare Youth Service under the aegis of Youth Work Ireland. The project has been allocated funding of &euro;86,264 in 2014. This is a reduction of 3.75% on the allocation available to the project in 2013.</p><p>  I am aware of the challenges that the budgetary constraints raise for the youth services throughout the country including the Leixlip Youth Project. Officials from my Department  have met Youth Work Ireland in relation to the challenges which local projects face in meeting the needs of young people. I have met and will continue to meet with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources available in order to continue to support the provision of quality and responsive youth services for young people.</p></reply>

The Minister for Justice and Equality has overall responsibility in the area of crime and anti-social behaviour and his Department funds a range of community based responses to youth crime,  in particular Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) and Young Person Probation Projects (YPP). I see the role of my Department as working in an integrated way to develop strong linkages between all those working in prevention and intervention, developing closer working relationships between the prevention services provided by the Child and Family Agency, and services provided by the Irish Youth Justice Service, which is co-located in my Department, and services in the youth sector which are funded by my Department. </p><p>  On 3 February 2014, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice and Equality, I launched the Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018.  The overall mission statement of the Action Plan is to create a safer society by working in partnership to reduce youth offending through appropriate interventions and linkages to services.  The Action Plan will form part of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework (CYPPF) currently being developed in my Department and will also form part of the National Anti-Crime Strategy currently being developed by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The High Level Goals of the Plan are as follows: High Level Goal 1: To work together to ensure public confidence in dealing with young people in trouble with the law; High Level Goal 2: To strengthen and develop our evidence base to support more effective policies and services, having regard to the voice of young people; High Level Goal 3: To review and strengthen targeted interventions to reduce offending and divert young people from the criminal justice system; High Level Goal 4: To promote and increase the use of community measures, including restorative justice, for young people who offend; High Level Goal 5: To provide a safe, secure environment and necessary support for detained young people to assist their re-integration into the community.</p><p>  My Department also provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector. This includes provision for the Youth Service Grants Scheme under which funding is made available to support 31 national and major regional voluntary organisations involved in the development and provision of youth programmes and services. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  Young people are provided with a wide range of programmes and activities, which respond to their needs, interests, capacity and age profile. The supports available are complementary to the school system and to other supports in place to assist young people who are marginalised and contribute to addressing a range of issues affecting young people and their communities including early school leaving, unemployment, drug/substance misuse, youth homelessness, and the impact of problems to do with juvenile crime and anti-social behaviour.</p></reply>

As e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco they are currently not regulated under our tobacco legislation.  </p><p>  Guidelines developed under the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control contain recommendations that countries should not grant aid the tobacco industry.  However, it is important to note that these guidelines were developed in the context of the industry producing tobacco containing products.</p><p>  Tobacco Free Ireland, Ireland&rsquo;s tobacco control policy, states that the general consensus at European level is that there is a lack of research in relation to the long term health effects of e-cigarettes and a lack of sufficient evidence that they aid with smoking cessation. There is a concern that e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to tobacco smoking.</p><p>  In order to harmonise regulation of e-cigarettes across EU Member States, the new Tobacco Products Directive,which still has to be formally adopted at European level will, inter alia, provide for the regulation of e-cigarettes.  The Tobacco Directive will set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes; make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory; introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes; impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.</p><p>  In view of the lack of sufficient research and information regarding e-cigarettes,  my Department will continue to monitor existing and emerging evidence on the potential harm and the potential benefits of e-cigarettes.</p></reply>

However, these businesses are required to comply with general public health and safety legislation in the same way as any other business. </p><p>  The responsibilities of business operators include taking all reasonable precautions for the safety of persons using the premises.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 imposes a duty on employers to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of employees.  Employers are also obliged to manage and conduct his or her undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that in the course of the work being carried on, individuals at the place of work, (not being employees), are not exposed to risks to their safety, health and welfare.</p><p>  In addition, under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, a Medical Officer of Health or an Environmental Health Officer is empowered where there is reason to believe that a suspected case of an infectious disease or a probable source of infection exists, to take such steps as are necessary for investigating the nature and source of such infection. </p><p>  High standards of hygiene are necessary when tattooing in order to minimise the risks for both the person carrying out the tattooing and the client.  Standard Infection Control Precautions were developed for the healthcare setting but they can and should be applied to any settings where there is a potential for persons to be exposed to blood or other body fluids including tattooing premises.  It is also advisable that anyone carrying out tattooing receive the hepatitis B vaccination.   </p><p>  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are currently reviewing policy regarding tattooing and body piercing.  In the first instance, the focus is on the development of a best practice guidance document aimed at practitioners in the area.  The main objective of this guidance is to encourage best hygiene practice by tattooists and piercers, thereby minimising the risk of infection and so protecting both the artists and clients.</p><p>  The draft guidance document has been the subject of consultation within the health sector and it is expected that the Department and the Health Service Executive will be in a position to bring the guidance to completion later this year.</p></reply>

In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The revised working arrangements provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement are a pivotal element in this regard.</p><p>  Subject to approval by senior managers, arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement.  In addition, the HSE continues to fill a significant number of development posts in line with service priorities identified by Government.  The Support Staff Intern Scheme also allows for the recruitment of 1000 staff in roles such as Health Care Assistants, Multi-Task Attendants and Support Grades.  The scheme facilitates the intern achieving the appropriate FETAC level 5 qualification, which will be an invaluable asset in their professional development.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report was to assess the feasibility of using the HIPE system to derive healthcare quality indicators that could be used in the future to measure the quality of the care provided in our hospitals.  The analysis and the report is about the quality of the selected indicators and data not the quality of care. </p><p>  This analysis of HIPE data was a process that involved ongoing discussion with the HSE. During 2011 the analysis highlighted a number of variations with a small number of hospitals being identified as outliers for certain indicators. There are a lot of possible explanations for these variations including issues relating to the coding of the principle diagnosis, coding of the healthcare records to the HIPE system, inclusion of confounding factors in the analysis of the indicators and quality of care. However, this analysis of the data does not allow for an underlying variation in the quality of care to be excluded. Therefore it was necessary for this information to be reflected back to the hospitals as only the hospitals are in a position to assess their data to determine the reasons for the variation. This information was communicated through the Quality and Patient Safety Directorate, HSE to the hospitals in mid 2011. </p><p>  My Department has been assured by the HSE that the hospitals have had the opportunity both to correct their data and address any quality of care issues. </p><p>  This report confirms the value of the HIPE system as a resource for the development of indicators of quality of care in our hospitals but it also shows that hospital data and the indicators need to be further refined before they can be used for this purpose.  Measuring the quality of our healthcare and publicly reporting how our services are performing is part of my Government&rsquo;s commitment to improved accountability and continued improvement in our health services.  It is my intention that my Department will publish a report on quality healthcare indicators at national, regional and hospital level later this year which will be based on corrected data and will identify hospitals.</p></reply>

Currently there are 34,300 nurses employed.  This number has to be considered in conjunction with the numbers of Health Care Assistants which now stands at 2,878.  In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The additional working hours provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement are a pivotal element in this regard. The increase in nursing hours available under the Agreement equates to nearly 1,400 additional nurses.</p><p>  The Agreement also includes the Graduate Nurse/Midwife Initiative.  This supports the retention of graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.  Participants will have access to a variety of care settings while gaining clinical experience.  Up to 1,000 two-year contracts are being made available under this initiative and about half of these have been filled.  A Support Staff Intern Scheme also allows for the recruitment of a similar number of staff.  The scheme facilitates the intern achieving the appropriate FETAC level 5 qualification, which will be an invaluable asset in their professional development.  I have been advised that the HSE is processing large numbers of Intern applications at present. Once in situ these interns will provide vital support to healthcare professionals, including nurses, in the healthcare setting.</p><p>  Ireland possesses an exceptionally well trained nursing profession.  Indeed Ireland was to the fore in recognising the relationship between  nurse education and patient safety and was one of the first countries in the world to embrace an all graduate profession within the introduction of the under-graduate pre-registration programme in 2002.  This also has to be taken into account when considering nursing numbers.  I have embarked on a significant reform programme in the health services, including the establishment of the Hospital Groups.  This and other initiatives in train will greatly assist in the optimum use of resources including nursing staff across hospital groups.</p></reply>

This represents the most fundamental reform of the Irish acute hospital system in decades. Each group of hospitals will work together as single cohesive entities managed as one, to provide acute care for patients in their area, integrating with community and primary care.  This will maximise the amount of care delivered locally, whilst ensuring complex care is safely provided in larger hospitals.</p><p>  I have established a Strategic Advisory Group to provide objective advice and expertise to my Department and the HSE relating to the establishment of hospital groups. Groups will be required, within one year, to develop a strategic plan which will outline their plans for future services within the group area and the role of hospitals within each group will be considered in detail in the context of this strategic plan.  Consideration of the configuration of acute services, including emergency services, will take place in the context of the establishment of the hospital groups, the development of their strategic plans, and the opportunity to improve access and services for patients. </p></reply>

The White Paper on Universal Health Insurance will provide details on the various organisations and their functions that will be integral to the delivery of UHI.

Calculating the cost of UHI is a complex  matter and is dependent on a number of critical and interdependent variables such as: demand for and utilisation of healthcare, service  delivery models, payment systems, services to be provided by the UHI standard package of care as well as the regulatory and administrative costs.  Developing overall costings for UHI, including administration costs, will require expert analytical support and time to undertake.

While the Memorandum identified a number of challenges, the great potential of the event is also clear and I believe that hosting the Rugby World Cup on a cross-border basis in 2023 would be a great opportunity for Northern Ireland and Ireland.  Aside from the potential economic boost, the tournament would raise our international profile, not just in terms of sport and tourism, but also more widely in terms of business, trade and investment.  Attracting major international events is a key element of tourism strategy on both sides of the border and cooperation between north and south can enhance such events.</p><p>  In response to the Memorandum, the Government expressed strong support for the proposal and for the conduct of further work to get to the stage of making a formal decision to bid.  In order to progress the matter further, Minister of State Ring and I met with Minister Arlene Foster, who is the Minister responsible for tourism in the Northern Ireland Executive, and Minister Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chul&iacute;n, who is responsible for sport in the Executive, in Armagh on 22 January.  At that meeting, we agreed to establish a working group to examine some key issues further and to report back to Ministers in the Summer.

In this regard the NRA has arranged in recent times for multi annual maintenance contracts to be put in place for certain motorways and dual carriageways.

The NDLS is structured with a central unit in the RSA and three outsourced contractors.  These are: a card producer for the plastic card licence; a front office to engage with the public; and a back office to process applications.  There were problems with the speed of processing applications in the NDLS when the system came on stream last October.  Some were technical and systems issues, while others related to new staff becoming familiar with rules and processes around driving licences and permits.</p><p>  The RSA responded by increasing resources in NDLS centres experiencing delays, as well as in the licence processing centre, and providing further training to staff.  There are no major technical difficulties now affecting the service.  A booking system to allow for customers to make appointments has been operating in a Pilot Phase which was successful.  This system is now being extended on a phased basis to all NDLS offices.</p><p>  While I understand that there are still some backlogs in relation to applications, the situation has improved.   I have been informed that licence applications that are fully and correctly completed are being issued in a shorter timeframe than previously and work is continuing to achieve a ten day turnaround by the end of February and a five to eight day turnaround by the end of March. The RSA has assured me that the remaining backlog largely has been cleared.  </p><p>  Where a medical certification of fitness to drive is required with a driving licence application, the law requires that the certification by a registered medical practitioner.  There are no provisions requiring that the person signing the form should be from a medical practitioner of a particular specialty.  The law on medical fitness to drive - which is set at EU level - is clear on what is required.  In addition, I gather that the Irish College of General Practitioners issues guidelines to assist GPs in making decisions on fitness to drive.</p><p>  I have no plans to change this system.</p></reply>
