The project will comprise a new 16-classroom primary school with General Purpose Room and ancillary accommodation.  The project will be delivered through the Design and Build approach where the contractor employs elements of off-site construction. </p>  <p>  Architectural planning to advance the project has commenced and the tendering process for site surveys is in train.  The project will then proceed to secure the necessary statutory approvals.  In the context of advancing the project, a representative from my Department&rsquo;s Building Unit visited the school site last week and this also provided an opportunity to update the school in relation to its project.  The subsequent milestone for the project will be the submission of a planning application to the local authority.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the school is currently located in temporary accommodation on the site where the new school is to be constructed.  The site is currently being acquired from the local authority.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office is currently finalising the contract in conjunction with the local authority.  My Department does not anticipate any difficulty in finalising the transaction at this stage.  The finalising of the site purchase is not holding up the progression of the building project.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next 4 years (2019 to 2022).  This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-22a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052200057#WRA01400"><p>There are a total of 177 Primary Schools and 27 Post Primary Schools in County Donegal.  Of these, 107 primary and 13 post primary schools avail of supports in the DEIS Programme.  60% of all primary schools and 48% of post primary schools in Donegal are in DEIS.  This equates to 13.3% of all DEIS schools being based in Co. Donegal. </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that no school in DEIS has had a withdrawal of funding. Each school's level of funding is based on its enrolment and its level of disadvantage.  Any decrease in funding provided to a school included in the DEIS Programme would be due to a drop in that school's enrolment or its level of disadvantage and not because of any policy change in funding allocation or disadvantage status. </p>  <p>  In 2017, I was in a position to provide additional supports to 110 schools through DEIS.  This was the first time since 2009 than any new school was added to DEIS.  As a result, in addition to previous provision in Co. Donegal, 1 primary school got Urban Band 1 status for the first time while 2 further Primary schools were upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.  18 primary schools that were designated as DEIS rural were also brought into the programme for the first time together with an additional Post Primary school.  </p>  <p>  Since the end of 2011/12 school year, the SNA allocation in Co Donegal has increased from 471.44 to 731.39, a percentage increase of over 55%. </p>  <p>  The Special Education Teaching allocation in Co Donegal has increased from 358.46 posts at the end of the 2011/12 school year, to 497.5 posts in the current 2017/18 school year.  This amounts to an increase of 38%.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department provides a Minor Works Grant to all schools on a yearly basis, based on enrolment.  This funding allows minor works to be carried out on the physical infrastructure of schools or on the purchase of items of furniture and equipment.</p></reply>

The development will consist of a new 2,221 sqm school building with on-site parking provisions, all associated landscaping, boundary treatments, site works and ancillary services.</p>  <p>  The design team on this project was appointed in January 2016. Planning permission was granted in May 2017. The stage 2(b) submission which includes all statutory approvals, final designs and full tender documentation was submitted by the design team to my Department in late February 2018. </p>  <p>  The Stage 2B submission was reviewed by my Department and comments issued earlier this week. The school and its design team have been authorised to commence the pre-qualification shortlisting of building contractors. A letter recently issued to the school with regard to a timeframe for progression to tender outlining that this project will shortly commence the tender process and is anticipated to commence construction in Quarter 4 of 2018.</p></reply>

This requires information on the options and supports, as well as ensuring schools, families, other Government Departments and Agencies work together to ensure the needs of students can be reasonably met. </p>  <p>  My Department, together with the NCSE, SOLAS, Education and Training Boards (ETBs), HSE, Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection among others have key roles to play in delivering on various actions to enable achievement of key strategic priorities, including transition from school to further or higher education and adult disability services.</p>  <p>  I understand that the context of the proposal to develop a Rehabilitative Training Transition Programme between NCSE and HSE stems from a review of the HSE's current Rehabilitation Programme. I am pleased that a meeting between NCSE and HSE will be convened shortly to discuss how this might be advanced. </p>  <p>  The Career Guidance Review, which is currently underway, is examining existing career guidance tools and career information for all post-primary/further education/higher education students and adults, currently in place across the education and training system in Ireland. </p></reply>

The school referred to by the Deputy does not meet the criteria.</p>  <p>  Each teaching principal receives a number of days to take as release time in order to undertake administrative functions. Under these arrangements, my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by the school on these release days. Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year is 15, 20 or 25 days depending on the size of the school. </p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year. This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector. </p></reply>

This compares to 548 special classes in 2011. </p>  <p>  By the end of this year, some 15,000 special needs assistants will be allocated to schools to support children with additional care needs at an annual cost of some &euro;524m. </p>  <p>  With regard to County Carlow, the allocation for the 2018/19 school year is 187 Special Needs Assistants across all mainstream and special schools, which represents an increase of 45% in the SNA allocation in County Carlow since the end of the 2011/12 school year, at which point 127.4 SNAS were allocated.</p>  <p>  116.5 Special Education Teachers are currently allocated to 42 primary schools and 52.9 Special Education Teachers are allocated to 11 post primary schools in the County. This is a total allocation of 169.4 special education teachers in County Carlow, compared to 58.6 resource teachers at the end of the 2011/12 school year. However the alocation process has changed in the interim so that the new allocation model now provides a total allocation for resource teaching and learning support.</p>  <p>  The number of special classes in the County will increase from 6 in 2011, to 32 in the 2018/19 school year, which represents a four fold increase in provision.</p></reply>

This trend continued in 2017 with a further increase of 28% on the 2016 figure bringing the total number of construction related registrations to 2,963.  </p>  <p>  Apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme, which aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market. Consequently, the number of construction related apprentices being registered is determined by employers within the construction sector. My Department and SOLAS are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector. Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, we are currently expanding the range of apprenticeships on offer to meet the identified skill needs of industry. Arising from our first call for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 an apprenticeship in Engineering Services Management, with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) as industry lead, is currently being developed into a national apprenticeship programme.  In addition, 26 further new programmes arising from last year&rsquo;s second call for proposals were approved for further development into national apprenticeships, including a scaffolding apprenticeship, again with the CIF as industry lead and a senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland as industry lead. These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs identified by the sector.</p>  <p>  In addition to apprenticeship provision, almost 7,000 beneficiaries participated in SOLAS-funded construction related further education and training (FET) programmes provided by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) under the &lsquo;Built Environment&rsquo; skills cluster during 2017.  Examples of these programmes include programmes in concreting, ground work, scaffolding and sustainable construction.  </p>  <p>  Separately, following a series of discussions with the CIF, SOLAS identified the following semi-skilled occupations as priority areas for the ETBs:</p>  <p> - Form worker;</p>  <p> - Steel-fixer;</p>  <p> - Curtain waller. </p>  <p>  Programmes have been put in place to produce approximately 100 form workers, 100 steel-fixers and 50 curtain wallers per year.  SOLAS will continue to engage with the ETBs to expand provision to meet needs in these areas.</p></reply>

The Bill aims to introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 recognised primary and post-primary schools in the country and to ensure a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils. The main provisions of the Bill include measures to:</p><p>- Ensure that where a school is not oversubscribed (approximately 80% of schools) it must admit all students applying;</p><p>- Ban waiting lists, thus ensuring parents who move to a new area are not disadvantaged;</p><p>- Ban fees relating to admissions in non-fee charging schools;</p><p>- Require all schools to publish their admissions policies, which will include details of their arrangements for pupils who decline to participate in religious instruction;</p><p>- Require all schools to consult with and inform parents where changes are being made to their admissions policies;</p><p>- Provide for a situation where a child (with special needs or otherwise) cannot find a school place, and allow the National Council for Special Education or Tusla (Child and Family Agency) to designate a school place for the child. </p><p>I have also publicly expressed my views that it is unfair that preference is given by publicly-funded religious schools to children of their own religion who might live some distance away, ahead of children of a different religion or of no religion who live close to the school.</p><p>I also believe that it is unfair that parents, who might otherwise not do so, feel pressure to baptise their children in order to gain admission to the local school and I intend to reform the school admissions system in relation to the role that religion can play in that process. </p><p>However I am also conscious that we need to provide protections to ensure that children of minority religions can continue to access primary schools of their particular minority religion or a similar minority religion.</p><p>Accordingly I am bringing forward a Report Stage amendment to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 to remove religion as a criterion which can be used in school admissions to primary schools, but with protections to ensure that children of minority religions can continue to access primary schools of their particular minority religion or a similar minority religion.</p><p>As I have stated previously this is a complex area and there are no easy solutions to this problem but I believe that the approach taken is a reasonable and proportionate approach to balance the rights of all.</p></reply>

The new model allocates teachers to schools on the basis of the profiled educational needs of each school. </p>  <p>  Over 13,400 Special Education Teaching posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools for the 2017/2018 school year provides additional teaching support to students with special educational needs, with up to 1,000 schools received additional allocations, where the new model indicates additional need and no school received an allocation of resources less than the allocation they received in the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  Approximately 1,440 special classes will be in place, with 140 new Special Classes to be opened in September 2018.

I was extremely pleased to be able to make the announcement on Friday, in keeping with the commitment made last year to inform schools of the September 2018 allocation by the end of May; at a time when they can give certainty to school communities at the earliest opportunity. As a result of this allocation, there will be a total of 15,000 Special Needs Assistants working in our schools, a 42% increase on 2011. The National Council for Special Education notified schools of their SNA allocations on Friday last and the details of these allocations are now published and available on their website at www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  In 2016, I requested the National Council for Special Education to lead a comprehensive review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme to identify and recommend how, in the future, additional care needs of students, over and above those needs that could be reasonably expected to be managed by teaching staff, should be met and to identify and recommend the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs who have additional care needs having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has recently submitted their report to me and the findings and conclusions of that report are now under consideration. </p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I recently announced that a demonstration project to provide in-school and pre-school therapy services will be introduced for the 2018/19 school year. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the project is to test a model of tailored therapeutic supports that allows for early intervention in terms of providing speech and language and occupational therapy within &lsquo;educational settings&rsquo;. This innovative pilot will complement existing HSE funded provision of essential therapy services.  </p>  <p>  As part of the programme, 19 speech and language therapists and 12 Occupational Therapists will be recruited by the HSE to work with the 150 schools and pre-schools. The NCSE will also recruit 2 National Co-ordinators to manage the project.</p>  <p>  The provision which is being made ensures that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p></reply>

My Department will shortly publish a circular which will request schools to consult with parents and students to develop policies for the use of smart phones and tablet devices in schools.</p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware of the challenges faced by educators, parents, and children, in relation to online safety and we are keen to support schools in any way we can.  The PDST (Technology in Education) is a dedicated team established and funded by the Department to advise and support schools in the area of digital technologies, including issues of internet safety.  Information and resources are also available for parents, teachers and children through the Webwise Internet Safety Initiative which promotes the safe use of the internet by young people and raises awareness for parents on the associated risks.</p>  <p>  The online safety of children is a matter relevant to many Government Departments, as well as parents and the wider society.  This requires a whole of Government approach and my Department is collaborating with these Departments on the development of an Action Plan on Internet Safety led by the Department of An Taoiseach.  Ongoing engagement is also maintained the Department of Justice and Equality which has a lead role in coordinating Government policy for internet safety, through the Office for Internet Safety.</p></reply>

These strategies include, in particular, the National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education 2016 &ndash; 2019 provides a key statement on the reform agenda across the education and training system.  The Plan contains a range of actions to be implemented with particular focus on disadvantage, skills needs, and continuous improvement within the education service.   </p>  <p>  The National Skills Strategy 2025 identifies Ireland&rsquo;s current skills profile, provides a strategic vision and specific objectives for Ireland&rsquo;s future skills requirements, and sets out a road map for how the vision and objectives can be achieved across the education and training sector. </p>  <p>  With over 140 Actions, the Plan sets out the Government's commitment to improving and using skills for sustainable economic growth and sets out how we can develop a well-skilled, adaptable workforce of all ages.</p>  <p>  A critical element of the Government's overall strategy in the skills area is ensure that both students and adults have access to the best possible advice, guidance and information in planning their working lives and responding to the pace of change impacting on all sectors of the workforce.

The Steering Group will oversee a programme of actions according to strict timelines and clear deliverables.  In undertaking its task, the Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching. </p></reply>

In that regard, I want to promote innovation and excellence at all levels of our education system.  I recognise that we also need to reward excellence in our schools.  There are many, many people in the school system with very good ideas.  The introduction of the School Excellence Fund will enable them and their schools to adopt more creative and innovative practices which will support improved outcomes for students in our schools. </p>  <p>  There are a number of strands in the School Excellence Fund. There are approximately 265 schools involved in the Digital, STEM and DEIS strands of the School Excellence Fund.  The various strands of the School Excellence Fund are at different stages of development; while work in some schools has already begun to take shape, work in others will commence in September next.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to increase, over time, the number of schools that will participate in the project.  For example, the closing date for participation in the Creative strand of the School Excellence Fund has just passed and the closing date for participation in the Step-up strand is fast approaching.  As these strands commence, additional schools will be involved in the project, while approximately forty further schools will participate in phase two of the DEIS strand. </p>  <p>  Participation in one of the strands of the School Excellence Fund will require schools and school leaders to collaborate, to network and to rise to the challenge of having the freedom to try things.  For example, participation in the School Excellence Fund-DEIS will enable schools to access the funding that will allow them to adopt their own creative ideas and approaches in their efforts to improve learning outcomes for their students.  In this and in other strands of the School Excellence Fund, I particularly welcome the involvement of local third level institutions and of businesses in many of the really good projects that we have already considered.  </p>  <p>  I fully appreciate that not everything that will be tried in the School Excellence Fund strands will work.  However, in terms of learning for the Department and for the schools, that is equally as important as finding out what will work effectively.  In short, I hope that the School Excellence Fund will help us to figure out not just what works, but what works best.</p></reply>

The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding (Cassells Report) which was published in July 2016, clearly outlines the funding challenges in the higher education sector and offers a number of potential policy approaches for consideration. </p><p>As committed to in the Programme for Government, I referred the Cassell's Report to the Oireachtas Education Committee to review its recommendations and outline a proposed funding plan for the sector, as part of the process of building political consensus around the most appropriate means of ensuring a sustainable funding model for the future.</p><p>In January 2018, 18 months after publication of the Report, my Department received a request from the Oireachtas Committee for the Department to carry out a comprehensive economic evaluation of each of the recommendations put forward in the Report. I have agreed to this request. </p><p>My Department and I are currently considering the most appropriate means of undertaking the economic examination of each of the proposed policy options presented in the Report to assist the Committee and to ensure that a sustainable funding model for Higher Education is developed to support the realisation of the economy&rsquo;s growth potential. No policy changes will be made in advance of this work being undertaken. </p><p>While Cassells deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education we also have to consider the immediate challenges.  Since publication of the Cassells Report I have prioritised additional investment in higher education in Budget 2017 and Budget 2018. As a result, the Department of Education and Skills is investing &euro;100m more in higher education in 2018 compared to 2016.  I will look to build on this investment in 2019 and beyond. </p><p>In January I published an independent review of the current allocation model for funding higher education which provides a roadmap for transitioning towards a reformed funding model that is more transparent, consistent across higher education institutions, incentivises actions in key strategic areas such as access to education, research and STEM provision, and supports improved accountability while also respecting institutional autonomy.</p><p>This comprehensive approach is being taken in order to contribute to the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the sector.  As such, it will be important to build broad political and societal consensus on achieving the most appropriate future funding model and my Department and I continue to work to that end. </p><p>The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme.  To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression.  The Student Grant Scheme 2018 and the Student Support Regulations 2018 can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website via the following links: </p><p><i></i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>My Department also provides funding for the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The fund is available in various publicly funded higher education institutions.  The SAF provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials.  The SAF is open to full-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.  </p></reply>

However of even greater concern to me is that when in cases of this nature the parent seeks a place in another school they face difficulty securing a place and the NCSE encounters similarly difficulties where it tries to assist securing a fresh start for the child. </p>  <p>  I believe that any significant delay in securing a new school place for a child with special educational needs is not acceptable.  For this reason, I have included a provision in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which will allow the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school place for a child with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  A parent or guardian will have the option of seeking a designation from the NCSE rather than having to take a Section 29 Appeal against the decision of the school board of management who has permanently expelled their child with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  I believe that this new provision will be effective at ensuring that a new school place is made available quickly for any child with special educational needs who has been permanently expelled. </p>  <p>  In the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, I am also replacing Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 and I am providing that the new Section 29 Appeal procedures will allow for greater flexibility in the timelines for hearing and determining appeals. </p></reply>

I, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, negotiated a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers.</p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently laid before the Oireachtas a report on the matter of the pay of new entrants to the public service.  The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).  Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussion on remaining salary scale issues with the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of newly qualified pay. That process commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.  Further talks began on the 27th of April with all public service unions in relation to new entrant pay.  Further engagement is being arranged for early June as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue.</p></reply>

School can now respond to individual need in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment or a diagnosis of a disability in order to access Special Education Teaching.  It also means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school.  Medical or psychological assessments will still be used to assess a child&rsquo;s needs, or the nature of difficulties they may have. However, an assessment, or diagnosis, will no longer be needed to access additional teaching support in schools. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools.  This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.  I am not aware of any particular delays in the process.</p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools. </p><p>I have highlighted that the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school in the South Kildare school planning areas, additional capacity in the region of 1,700 school places will be provided when projects at the following four schools in this area are completed: </p><p>- St. Conleth's Community College, Newbridge; </p><p>- Athy Community College, Athy; </p><p>- Cross and Passion Secondary School, Kilcullen; and </p><p>- St Paul's Secondary School, Monasterevin.</p><p>A building project for the Patrician College Newbridge is also included in my Department's 6 Year Construction Programme.</p><p>However, in line with the ongoing review of school planning areas generally, I can confirm that my Department is currently reviewing provision at post-primary level across the school planning areas in the South Kildare area and it is envisaged that work in this regard will be completed in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The primary focus of the visit was on growing trade, investment and tourism opportunities between Ireland and the US, and on highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the context of Brexit and other international developments. </p>  <p>  As part of the visit I visited the Headquarters of a number of companies with significant investments and operations in Ireland, including Facebook and Google. At each of these meetings, senior executives outlined their very positive experiences in Ireland, including the strong capabilities of their Irish-based workforces, and the positive outlook for their operations here. During the visit, I met Mr. Mark Zuckerburg, CEO of Facebook, however, I did not have any substantive discussion on regulatory matters with him. </p>  <p>  On 8 February 2018 I attended the official opening of the new Google building in Grand Canal Dock.</p></reply>

Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome.  It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.  This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.  It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the new Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors.</p><p>The Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector as well as additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50m in total.  Additional capital expenditure allocation of &euro;4.3bn over four years will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead.  There was also increased funding provided to my Department for the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets.</p><p>Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation published last November &lsquo;Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and training&rsquo;.  In total 34 reports analyzing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments.  All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>.</i></p><p>Longer-term economic strategies will also be critically important in addressing the challenges of Brexit, notably Ireland 2040 &ndash; the National Development Plan.  The Enterprise Strategy 2025 Renewed was recently launched and we are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank on a potential increase in investment in the country.</p><p>Before the summer the Government will finalise a paper, building on that published in May 2017, on our approach to the negotiations and our latest assessment of the economic and sectoral challenges posed by Brexit and our responses to them.</p></reply>

The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport.  These include a postal application system, online passport application service, in person counter application facilities in Dublin and Cork and the network of Irish Missions worldwide.</p><p>The target turnaround time for applications made via the online passport application service is 10 working days plus postage.  The majority of online applications are currently being processed within 5 working days, well ahead of target.  The online service currently accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications and it is planned to further extend this service to other categories of renewals by the end of 2018.</p><p>The highest proportion of applications are submitted through the An Post Passport Express postal channel.  The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently on target at 15 working days. </p><p>Other types of application, which are generally submitted through Passport Express, such as first time applications or applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports take longer. First time applications and applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports have a target turnaround time of 20 days and are currently taking 32 working days to process.  Such applications must undergo additional processes including security checks. </p><p>The Passport Service is currently in its peak season for passport demand with the vast majority of applications being received between February and August each year.  The Passport Service has kept its turnaround targets constant over the last 6 months in spite of continuously increasing application volumes.</p><p>Turnaround targets are determined on the basis of available resources and projected demand.  Turnaround times are among a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) by which the Passport Service measures its success in delivering a modern and responsive public service.  The operation and performance of the Passport Service is overseen by the management board and the Secretary General of my Department.  Measures taken by the Passport Service to minimise the impact of peak time application volumes on turnaround times for all categories of applications include the recruitment of additional staff and the use of targeted overtime for all Passport Offices. </p><p>The Passport Service received sanction this year for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) for appointment to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork. All TCOs in this intake have been fully trained and placed since March.  These TCOs are working together with permanent staff to process passport applications and to deal with the high number of enquiries being made through the Passport Service&rsquo;s various customer service channels. </p><p>The number of Full Time Equivalent staff permanently employed by my Department and assigned to the Passport Service stood at 322 at the beginning of the year.  This compares to 310.  Full Time Equivalent staff assigned to the Passport Service at the same point last year.  In addition, over 20 additional permanent staff have been assigned to the Passport Service in 2018. </p><p>My Department has an extensive communication strategy to promote good practice amongst passport holders when planning to travel abroad.  We regularly advise applicants of 3 golden rules:</p><p>- to check the validity of the passports in advance of booking travel; </p><p>- to apply at least 6 weeks in advance of their travel plans; and </p><p>- for eligible adults renewing their passport to consider the Online Passport Renewal Service passport application online facility, which is a fast, secure way for adults renewing their passport. Current average turnaround times, detailed &amp;amp; regularly updated information on passport services and comprehensive guides to the various application processes can be consulted at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s website <i>www.dfa.ie/passport.  </i></p><p>The Passport Service continues to work closely with Communications Unit of An Post to ensure that information disseminated by An Post staff is accurate and up-to-date.</p></reply>

The European Union (Payment Services) Regulations 2018, which transposed the revised Payment Services Directive, prohibit a payee from requesting an additional charge from a consumer for using a SEPA direct debit.  However, it is possible to apply other charges; for example an administrative fee, a service fee, or a fee where payment is made by instalments.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that it has no remit over the pricing of insurance policies.  However, the Consumer Protection Code 2012 requires that a regulated entity must provide a consumer, prior to providing a product or service to that consumer, with a breakdown of all charges, including third party charges, which will be passed on to the consumer.  The Central Bank is responsible for ensuring compliance with this code.</p></reply>

This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.   </p>  <p>  Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, tax credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.</p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status.  It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting and it would be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  Furthermore, while there may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the partial transferability of the standard rate band and tax credits, their legal status as spouses / civil partners has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.  To counter tax avoidance, numerous restrictive provisions regarding transactions between "connected persons" are contained in the various Tax Acts and the definition of "connected persons" extends to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.  Such provisions could be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition.</p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Any change to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p></reply>

Extensive restrictions are in place, which, in summary, limit total remuneration for staff in AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB to &euro;500,000 (excluding a standard pension contribution).  Policy also dictates that bonuses and many other benefits cannot be paid to any staff. This policy impacts c. 23,000 workers across the three banks.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be further aware that I recently acknowledged  that it is possible, in the future, that the context for bank pay could change; things are changing in the economy, Brexit is on the horizon and that will likely bring with it more intense competition for talent across the sector.</p>  <p>  We are also likely to see more companies moving into Ireland in the coming years, who will not be subject to the restrictions in the way that some of our banks are.  With our economy almost back to full employment, the environment in which all of the companies who are based here operate has altered, and will continue to change.

The content of the agreed document is available on the websites and the social media channels of the major motor insurance providers, and will also be provided to policyholders on renewal.</p>  <p>  My Department is satisfied that the information being provided to policyholders fulfils the essence of the recommendation without a need for legislation to underpin it as had been originally stipulated in Action Point 2, which was formulated at a stage when it was envisaged that the document provided to policyholders would be bespoke in nature.  It does not consider that it is necessary at this juncture to pursue legislation in respect of the non-bespoke protocol which has been agreed through non-legislative means but will continue to monitor how the protocol is functioning in practice.</p>  <p>  In an ideal scenario, I believe policyholders should be furnished with the specific reason or reasons for an increase in their insurance premium.  However, the main reason why such a bespoke document cannot be provided is because my Department has been advised that the complexity of the interaction between the customer-facing systems and the underwriting systems in all modern insurance companies would make it very difficult to delineate specific reasons for an individual premium increase.  If insurers were to try and link these systems in order to address this issue, it would require very significant IT infrastructural changes at considerable cost, which would almost certainly in turn lead to higher premiums.  In addition, the Working Group believes that such an onerous requirement could result in the unintended consequence of discouraging new entrants to the market.  Nevertheless, as part of the protocol consumers will be provided with contact details of their insurance provider in order to enable them to receive more &ldquo;tailored&rdquo; information if they do not believe any of the listed reasons apply to their situation.</p>  <p>  I am keen to improve the level of information provided to policyholders by seeking to have the previous year&rsquo;s premium included in renewal documentation.  My Department has discussed this matter with Insurance Ireland.  It also requested that this information be included in renewal documentation by means of a submission to a consultation which was undertaken by the Central Bank of Ireland &ndash; Consultation Paper 114: &ldquo;Amendments to the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007 (S.I.

As Minister for Finance, I support the objective of the Recommendations which involve enhancing the information provided to consumers and improving their experience in taking out an insurance policy.</p>  <p>  On 9 November 2017, the CBI published Consultation Paper 114 (CP114): &ldquo;Amendments to the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 74 of 2007)&rdquo;.  The purpose of the consultation was to seek views from interested stakeholders on Recommendations 2 and 3.  The proposals within the consultation included insurers providing additional information on the premium breakdown to consumers and extending the current renewal notification period, in respect of motor insurance, from 15 working days to 20 working days.  The consultation further considered whether the extension of the renewal notification period should be broadened to include other classes of businesses that fall within S.I. No. 74 (e.g., accident and health, fire and other damage to property and general liability insurance).</p>  <p>  Eight submissions were received by the Central Bank, including one from the Department of Finance seeking the inclusion of last year&rsquo;s premium in the additional information being provided to policyholders.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Bank that an analysis of the submissions is being undertaken with continued consideration of potential amendments to S.I. No. 74.  They have indicated that a further consultation may be warranted arising from the submissions.  In that case, the Central Bank will aim to have any amendments that may be required to S.I. No. 74 completed by the end of the year.  This potential delay is flagged in the monitoring dashboard of the 5th Update Report available on the website of the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

I would like to clarify at the outset that it is possible for an insurance undertaking authorised in one member state to conduct business in another EU/EEA state either through: </p><p>- establishing a branch operation in the host country and thus conducting business on a &lsquo;freedom of establishment&rsquo; (FOE) basis; or</p><p>- writing business from the home country (i.e. where authorised) into the host country on a &lsquo;freedom of services&rsquo; (FOS) basis.</p><p>In both situations the undertaking is required to meet certain obligations in the host member state, such as becoming a member of the national bureau and the national guarantee fund.  These are important requirements as the Bureau is tasked with meeting the requirement of compensating victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.</p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of the existing framework, the Cost of Insurance Working Group heard from a number of stakeholders that there is room for further harmonisation in cross-border insurance.  As the Working Group concluded however, this is a pan-European issue which will only be resolved at that level.  In this regard, Recommendation 5 of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance recommended that the Department of Finance support efforts and raise awareness of this need to improve cross-border insurance at EU level.  The Working Group&rsquo;s Fifth Quarterly Progress Update was published on 11 May 2018: <i>http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5th-Progress-Update-Q1-2018-Focus.pdf. </i>That Report outlines the implementation of this recommendation.</p><p>In this regard, the Department of Finance is monitoring developments at EU level on an ongoing basis and has instructed the Permanent Representation in Brussels to hold consultations with relevant institutions on issues raised in the report.  I understand that officials in the Permanent Representation have been working on ensuring that the key messages from the Working Group&rsquo;s report are understood by relevant EU officials in Brussels.  However, work at EU level will very much depend on the priorities of the European Institutions, especially in the context of the ongoing negotiations with the UK as regard its exit from the EU.</p><p>I understand that the European Commission will shortly publish a revised Directive on Motor Insurance, subject to its approval.  This proposal will likely cover a range of issues including the portability of claims history statements throughout the EU, possible guarantees towards victims in cases of insurer's insolvency, the scope of the Directive and the insurance of autonomous cars.  All of these issues are relevant to the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and I welcome the fact that this proposal is due to be published soon.</p><p>Finally, an important point to note is that an insurer in considering whether it wants to take on Irish risk business will look at a wide range of factors including the award levels, the legal system, the general claims culture etc.  Therefore ultimately, even if we do get a more efficient and accessible EU insurance market, there can be no guarantees that insurers in other jurisdictions will automatically be willing to take on Irish risk. </p></reply>

The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, continuous driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein or, indeed, whether the country is a member of the EU or not.</p><p>In addition to the above, insurance companies have agreed to provide relevant and helpful information on their websites to make it easier for consumers to understand the implications of their move abroad from a motor insurance perspective.  As part of this exercise, they will outline what people need to do under a number of different circumstances depending on the length of time they intend being away from Ireland.</p><p>If a returning emigrant believes that they have received a high quote due to an insurance provider not accepting driving experience gained while abroad, they should contact the free Insurance Information Service operated by Insurance Ireland, which can be accessed at<i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu</i>or 01-6761820.</p><p>Ultimately, if a returning emigrant is unable to secure a motor insurance quotation on the open market, they may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process, and<i>declined@insuranceireland.eu</i>is the relevant e-mail address in this respect.</p><p>In relation to the implementation of Recommendation 6, Insurance Ireland submitted a report to the Department in December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website.</p><p>The Insurance Ireland report also outlined some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provided figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the DCA is decreasing.</p><p>In conclusion, my Department is satisfied that the essence of the recommendation is being fulfilled without a need for legislation to underpin it.  Moreover, I would be very cautious about going down such a route as in my role as Minister for Finance I cannot interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p><p>You should note however that I will continue to monitor the implementation of this recommendation through my Department&rsquo;s regular engagement with Insurance Ireland.</p></reply>

In addition, while accepting that an insurer has the ultimate right to settle a claim, I am also of the view that it should give appropriate consideration to policyholder&rsquo;s views in the processing of any such claim.  It is also important that a policyholder is informed as soon as a claim is settled.</p>  <p>  As outlined recently in PQ 21879/18 regarding Recommendation 8, the Department believes that the substance of the Communication Guidelines for Insurers and Policyholders agreed between the IIF and IBEC in 2003 covers what is required to implement fully this recommendation.  However, Insurance Ireland has argued that this recommendation is achieved through the application of the 2012 Consumer Protection Code and that the 2003 Guidelines have been superseded.</p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to pursue the implementation of Recommendation 8, in parallel with a related recommendation from the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance (Recommendation 10).  Options are being considered as to the best course of action for bringing the recommendations forward, given industry&rsquo;s diverging opinion on the matter.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am not in a position at this juncture to state when Recommendation 8 of the Motor Report will be fully completed but the Deputy should note that the deadline for implementation of the related Recommendation 10 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Report is Q4 2018.</p></reply>

It did however recognise that this sector serves a social as well as an economic purpose, particularly in rural areas where public transport is less readily available.  This position was acknowledged by the inclusion of Recommendation 10 in the Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  This recommended that the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles should enter regular discussions with Insurance Ireland to explore solutions for drivers in the sector.</p><p>The Working Group&rsquo;s Fifth Quarterly Progress Update was published on 11 May 2018:<i>.</i>That Report outlines the implementation of this recommendation.</p><p>In summary, Insurance Ireland met with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, commonly known as the Taxi Advisory Committee (TAC), on 22 May 2017.  The TAC submitted the required report in relation to this meeting on 21 June 2017 to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  To date, no further meetings have taken place between the TAC and Insurance Ireland.  However, the TAC has advised my officials that it is keeping itself informed of developments in the area, particularly through the industry representatives on the Committee, and future meetings with Insurance Ireland are a part of the TAC strategy.  Recommendation 10 has been completed in the sense that the TAC has reported to the Minister for Transport.  Notwithstanding this, my view would be that work needs to continue on this general issue.  Therefore, I look forward to further engagements between the TAC and the insurance industry.</p><p>I would add that, notwithstanding the role of the TAC, the issues raised by the taxi sector were in the main similar to those affecting consumers generally, notwithstanding that there are risks that are specific to the sector.  While there is no silver bullet to reduce the cost of insurance, I believe that cooperation and commitment between all parties can deliver fairer premiums for consumers, including taxi drivers.  I note that the most recent CSO data (for April 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.  While these statistics are not directly relevant to commercial vehicles, I do believe they signal greater stability in pricing on an overall basis and I am hopeful that the general downward direction in pricing will continue.</p><p>I also believe that the work of the Cost of Insurance Group should better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.  In this regard, I have been informed by my officials that Insurance Ireland has stated that there has been some increase in market capacity in relation to the provision of motor insurance for taxi drivers recently.</p></reply>

The Report is the second in a series of reports designed to address Recommendation 12 of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which aim to increase the level of transparency of the insurance sector in advance of the National Claims Information Database.  The Report follows up on the first report, published in July 2017.  It is likely that there will be at least one further report prior to the establishment of the National Claims Information Database.</p>  <p>  By way of additional information on the production of these reports, a Sub-group of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, was established in January 2017 to implement this and other recommendations to improve data transparency.  The Sub-group engaged extensively with Insurance Ireland who indicated that a number of the metrics identified in the Working Group&rsquo;s Report were not available in a consistent fashion due to different definitions and different ways for reporting and recording data.  Notwithstanding this, a data set was agreed and a data request was issued to Insurance Ireland in March 2017.</p>  <p>  This request sought information in two tranches.  The first tranche was received on 13 June 2017 and resulted in the publication of the first Motor Insurance Key Information Report in July 2017.  In line with the complexity of the additional data being requested in the second tranche, it was agreed that Insurance Ireland would engage independent consultants - Verisk - to collect and compile the data in the case of this more complex data set.  On 18 December 2017, a return, in the form of a report by Verisk outlining certain data and conclusions, was submitted to the Department by Insurance Ireland.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the Department and the Sub-group engaged with Insurance Ireland seeking some clarifications in relation to how the data and the conclusions presented were arrived at.</p>  <p>  The Department, while accepting that the process to collate the data was rigorous, emphasises that any conclusions reached on the data are Verisk&rsquo;s and have not been subject to any further actuarial analysis by it or the Central Bank, other than for clarifications.  This is because, from a practical and cost perspective, the subgroup saw little to be gained from procuring a further independent actuarial analysis to verify the return, where it was satisfied that a robust process was evidenced by the detailed approach to the gathering of this data by Verisk.  In addition, it should be noted that over the course of its work, the Sub-group took the view that the production of reports on a quarterly basis was not realistic in view of the complexity of the data exercise.</p>  <p>  To conclude, while the recommendation is seen primarily as an interim step that increases the level of transparency in advance of the establishment of the National Claims Information Database, I believe that the series of reports are an important foundation stone as they have helped prepare industry for the new database.  In addition, in view of the challenges in collating and analysing aggregate level data across the insurance sector in Ireland, this exercise strongly demonstrates the value and need for the National Claims Information Database. </p></reply>

Two associated actions were recommended as part of this recommendation: </p><p>- To establish a sub-group to consider the feasibility of a longer term claim by claim register by Q1 of 2018, and </p><p>- To Report on the feasibility of a claim by claim register by Q3 2018. </p><p>The Working Group&rsquo;s Fifth Quarterly Progress Update was published on 11 May 2018:<i>.</i>That Report outlines some of the progress to date on this recommendation.</p><p>In summary, in relation to the first action point, in Q1 of this year, the data sub-group, which was established to drive the implementation of each of the data related recommendations, commenced work on considering the feasibility of a longer term claim-by-claim register. It agreed a draft work plan and decided to undertake a consultation in Q2 with a view to seeking the views of stakeholders on the key considerations required when looking at the feasibility of a claim-by-claim register.</p><p>To that end, I launched a public consultation on 14 May 2018 and it is available on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website<i>: </i>.

The National Claims Information Database is currently being developed by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland, and the Insurance Fraud Database is currently being developed by the Department of Justice.</p><p>In particular, I am keen to try and identify what form a claim-by-claim register could take, as there are a diverse range of views in relation to this matter, as well as a number of considerations which would need to be satisfactorily taken account of, including those which the Deputy mentions, namely data protection, cost and potential barriers to entry.</p><p>Following the consultation process, the data Sub-group will review the responses, meet with relevant stakeholders and carry out its own further research.  Given the timeline and work plan that are in place, I expect that the Report on the feasibility of a claim by claim register will be available by the Q3 deadline set down in the Report.</p></reply>

The Strategy was a whole of government approach to the continued development of our international financial services sector and was developed to address the increasingly competitive and ever changing nature of international financial services.</p>  <p>  IFS2020 is currently led by Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD with the aim to create 10,000 net new jobs across the Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland portfolios in international financial services over five years from 2015 &ndash; 2020.  The vision of IFS2020 is for Ireland to be the location of choice for specialist international financial services, building on our strengths in talent, technology, innovation and excellent client services, while focusing on capturing new opportunities in a changing market and embracing the highest forms of governance.</p>  <p>  To date the IFS2020 Strategy has created approximately 7,000 net new jobs in the sector placing us on target to create 10,000 by 2020.  The IFS sector now employs almost 42,000 people across Ireland with 30% of those employed in the sector located outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  The IFS2020 Strategy was devised after a series of consultations with stakeholders and with input from the relevant Government departments and agencies including the Department of Finance.  The secretariat for the strategy was originally based in the Department of the Taoiseach. It moved to the Department of Finance in 2016 in tandem with the announcement of the new role of Minister of State for Financial Services. </p>  <p>  IFS2020 is due to expire in 2019. Minister D&rsquo;Arcy and officials from my department have begun to consider the development of a successor to IFS2020 and this will continue over the coming months through consultation with relevant stakeholders across both the public and private sector. </p>  <p>  Part of the success of the current Strategy is the public-private consultation and engagement on the Strategy and annual Action Plans.  A series of targeted and focussed consultation on the content of the strategy will take place as part of the drafting of a new strategy.</p></reply>

The central purpose of the R&amp;D Tax Credit is to encourage companies to undertake high-value added RandD activity in Ireland, thereby supporting jobs and investment here.   </p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that it is not possible to accurately estimate the potential revenue that would be raised by reducing the R&amp;D Tax Credit to each of 20%, 15% and 10% as the yield would depend on future expenditure on RandD and also the possible negative impact on expenditure from the introduction of the reduced credits.</p>  <p>  However, on the basis of information on Corporation Tax returns for 2016, which is the latest year available, and on a straightforward mathematical basis, reducing the 25% rate to 20% could have yielded &euro;135 million.  This includes the impact on repayable credits from earlier years.  Further reductions to 15% and 10% can be estimated broadly on a pro-rata basis.</p>  <p>  I would highlight that the comprehensive review of the R&amp;D Tax Credit, undertaken by my department in 2016, found that the R&amp;D tax credit is responsible for 60% of the RandD being conducted here, which represents a reasonable level of additionality. Furthermore, for every &euro;1 in foregone tax revenue, more than &euro;2.40 in additional RandD is being conducted. My officials and I are conscious of the need for regularly evaluating this tax credit.  However, it is important to recognise that while this is a generous tax credit, it is one of the few corporation tax credits that we have in Ireland, when compared with other jurisdictions. In this respect, we are mindful of the need to maintain a competitive corporation tax offering.</p></reply>

The rules apply the arm&rsquo;s length principle to trading transactions between companies within a multinational group.  The arm&rsquo;s length principle is the international transfer pricing standard that OECD member countries have agreed should be used for tax purposes by multinational groups and tax administrations. For Irish tax purposes, &lsquo;arm&rsquo;s length&rsquo; is to be construed as far as practicable in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (July 2010).</p>  <p>  Under the arm&rsquo;s length principle, the amount charged by one related party to another for a product or service must be the same as would be charged between unrelated parties.  If, for example, an expense incurred by an Irish subsidiary company of a multinational group  in dealings with a foreign member of that group is greater than the arm&rsquo;s length price, or receipts are less than the arm&rsquo;s length amount, the company&rsquo;s profits will be understated for Irish tax purposes.  The transfer pricing rules require this understatement of profits to be reversed so that the full arm&rsquo;s length profits will be taxed.</p>  <p>  The transfer pricing rules apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 in relation to arrangements the terms of which were agreed on or after 1 July 2010.  The rules do not apply to Small or Medium Enterprises (&ldquo;SMEs&rdquo;), being enterprises that, on a group basis, have less than 250 employees and either a turnover of less than &euro;50m or assets of less than &euro;43m. SMEs are however subject to general tax principles which can also operate to guard against abusive transfer pricing practices.</p>  <p>  Companies are required to have documentation available for inspection by Revenue in relation to their transfer pricing policies in order to demonstrate compliance with the legislation. Revenue carries out risk-based transfer pricing compliance interventions.</p>  <p>  In his Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code, Mr. Seamus Coffey made a number of recommendations in relation to the Irish tax code, including the following recommendations in relation to transfer pricing:</p>  <p>1. Irish legislation should provide for the application of the 2017 update of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, incorporating Actions 8, 9 and 10 from the OECD&rsquo;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (&ldquo;BEPS&rdquo;) project.</p>  <p>2. Transfer pricing legislation should be applied to arrangements the terms of which were agreed before 1 July 2010.</p>  <p>3. Consideration should be given to extending transfer pricing rules to SMEs and also to non-trading and capital transactions.</p>  <p>4. In order to ensure implementation of BEPS Action 13 (Transfer Pricing Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting), there should be a specific obligation on Irish taxpayers who are subject to domestic transfer pricing legislation to have available the transfer pricing documentation outlined in the OECD 2017 Transfer Pricing Guidelines.</p>  <p>  In his review, Mr. Coffey recommended that if it is decided to implement any or all of these recommendations, this should take place no later than end-2020, being the year to which the OECD and G20 have agreed to extend their cooperation on BEPS. </p>  <p>  Mr. Coffey also recommended that, in order to ensure certainty of our regime, there should be detailed consultation with relevant stakeholders in relation to his recommendations.  Therefore, in October 2017, I launched a public consultation on the implementation of the Coffey recommendations.  The consultation ran up to 30 January 2018 and over 20 submissions were received, many of which were detailed technical submissions.  My Department is currently reviewing the responses received and these will inform my decisions on the development of future legislative change in the area of transfer pricing.</p></reply>

In that Book, the most common type of neck injury is called a &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; injury which is described as an over extension or sprain often suffered in a motor vehicle accident or high impact slip/trip/fall type of accidents.  It states that whiplash injuries can involve a very minor sprain that heals within days or weeks or they can in extreme cases cause long lasting pain and permanent disability.  It is therefore difficult to provide an average cost for such types of injuries as there is such a range of injuries linked to &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  In this respect, the Book of Quantum differentiates between the awards that may be considered for such injuries, ranging from &euro;15,700 to &euro;77,900.  While the recently published Second Motor Key Information Report provides average costs for lower value or capped motor third party injury claims, it does not provide specific values with regard to whiplash claims.  Costs associated with whiplash claims may form a part of these claims costs, however I would not interpret the data within the report in such a way to state that the values represent the average cost for &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; claims.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that when talking about the cost of whiplash claims, the costs will also include costs linked to motor third party claims such as legal, medical and other costs.  In this regard, the Department of Finance&rsquo;s First Key Information Report, published in July 2017, contained data that suggested such costs can account for approximately 40% of the award level provided in cases involving litigation.  </p>  <p>  With respect to actual or estimated typical premiums for drivers by age in particular for younger drivers, it is not possible to provide this information.  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) collects data on the price of motor insurance premiums as part of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) each month.  To ensure the soundness of the index, the CSO uses a variety of detailed profiles (including car age, car model, driver experience, driver history) sent directly each month to motor insurance companies that represent a substantial portion of the market share.  The profiles each company receives remain consistent each month so that the CSO can use a continuous "like with like" comparison in the best way possible and in this regard each company is sent a representative set of profiles for their consumer base.  The risks vary based on the detail contained in each of the profiles in order to get a larger spread of the realistic market.  It should be noted that the publication of the price index in this regard is consistent with how national statistics authorities produce such indices in other jurisdictions like the UK.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that in the UK, private sector operators provide additional premium price information broken down by other factors such as age, in the fashion requested by the Deputy.  My officials have examined these indices however they have found that each of these indices produce very different results, depending on the methodology used.  The value of producing such information is therefore highly questionable and may not assist consumers in the long run.</p></reply>

The 19,000 organisations in the Benefacts database include all registered charities and thousands of other NGOs, including education institutions, social enterprises and sports and professional bodies.</p><p>The grant is provided to Benefacts to support the implementation of their Strategy and Business Plan 2018-2020.  In summary, the activities envisaged in that are:</p><p>1. Increase the scope and size of the database.</p><p>Potentially doubling the size of the database from 20,000 to 40,000 by including locally based non-profits in partnership with local authorities and assigning these Unique Business Identifiers.  Also including political parties in partnership with the Clerk of the Dail and meeting various other requests from public bodies to include non-profits that they deal with.</p><p>2. Enhance the quality of the data disclosed and held on the database</p><p>Some public bodies have identified additional administrative data that they would like included in the database.</p><p>3. Provide the public website, data services and reports</p><p>Activities in this area include:</p><p>- Maintain, review and develop the website to double its traffic by 2020</p><p>- The provision of Open Datasets</p><p>- Continue to meet data requests from public bodies and generate small amounts of revenue from non-government sources</p><p>- Provide a restricted version of Benefacts Analytics to non-government users and generate small levels of income</p><p>- Produce the Benefacts&rsquo; Sector Analysis Report annually.</p><p>4. Support the Government&rsquo;s ICT policies</p><p>Activities here relate principally to the roll-out of Benefacts Analytics, a new web-based service to provide grant makers with governance, risk and compliance information more efficiently, supporting the National Data Infrastructure project by assigning Unique Business Identifiers and potentially developing an online financial data filing platform. </p><p>I understand that other Departments are assessing the potential to provide funding on a smaller scale in 2018.  This would include payments to deliver potential pilot data projects and local customisation of &lsquo;Benefacts Analytics&rsquo;.  These grant amounts would be subject to the agreement of a business case and the application of public procurement rules for each public body.</p></reply>

The aim of the LEEF is to provide a space to discuss areas of shared interest affecting the economy, employment and the labour market on a thematic basis.  These areas include competitiveness, sustainable job creation, labour market standards and equality and gender issues in the workplace.  Other issues discussed were the economic and fiscal outlooks and risks such as Brexit. </p>  <p>  At the most recent LEEF meeting, on 22 February 2018, it was agreed that Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would meet with employer and union representatives to develop proposals on options for deepening structured dialogue with employers and unions on issues of mutual interest through the LEEF.  This process, as agreed, will build upon the current structures and will involve the establishment of a number of sub-groups under the aegis of the LEEF.  This will facilitate engagement between relevant Ministers/Departments, Employers and Unions on a more regular basis, and where Ministers will be asked to ensure that they take account of the need to consult with the LEEF representatives when appropriate in their respective policy areas.</p>  <p>  Particular areas of concern for the sub-groups will be based on a list of priority areas agreed by LEEF members, and it is proposed in the first instance that these would be (i) pensions, (ii) employment legislation/regulation, (iii) housing and (iv) childcare.  The list will be updated by agreement at the LEEF over time to reflect changing priorities and avoid redundant or unnecessary permanent structures.  These issues are all highly relevant to the labour market and can be considered priority issues for all parties.</p></reply>

SNA support is also provided in mainstream classes where appropriate. </p><p>In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p><p>It is not the case that SNA support cannot be provided for a pupil who transitions from a special class placement to a mainstream class placement. SNA support may be provided in either setting, taking in account of the assessed care needs that the pupil has in that setting.  </p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO and parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available at . </p><p>The SENO will also be able to outline for the parent the criteria applicable to special education transport arrangements.  </p><p>Finally, I must advise the provision of speech and language and occupational therapy support services is a matter for the Health Service Executive. The Deputy's specific question in relation to the provision of speech therapy and occupational therapy support should therefore be addressed directly to the Department of Health. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-22a.412.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052200064#WRH03400"><p>This matter was resolved on 2 May between the two institutions referred to by the Deputy.  The third level institution has and continues to maintain excellent relations with the college.  Advanced entry to third year will continue to be offered in September 2018.  However, advanced entry into any programme is subject to the applicant meeting minimum entry criteria and the availability of places on the target programme.  </p>  <p>  The situation surrounding Social Care Practice is complex due to an evolving regulatory environment.  This includes significant change with respect to the design and management of education programmes in the area of social care practice.  This is necessary if such programmes are to achieve recognition from CORU, the statutory regulatory agency concerned, for listing under the Approved Qualifications Bye-Law.  This recognition will be essential if programme graduates are to be eligible to apply for entry onto the Social Care Workers Register as professional practitioners, which is a key objective for any such programme.  Social care practice programmes are in the process of being redesigned to meet the new CORU criteria, a process expected to be complete in the autumn. </p>  <p>   Students are required to achieve certain learning proficiencies at each stage of their programme.  This includes a requirement for a minimum of 800 hours of practice placement divided over 2 or more blocks demonstrating that the proficiencies have been met and supervised by a qualified Social Care Worker Registered with CORU.  Programmes as currently constructed, cannot accommodate this large volume of hours within a single academic year.  Because of this, a student completing a 2 year programme with one provider and seeking advanced level entry to year 3 of a higher level programme with another provider, must be able to demonstrate that they have successfully completed substantial placement hours that comply with the standards established by CORU.  Their initial programme of study will also need to be consistent with CORU criteria.  These criteria will come into effect from September 2019.</p>  <p>  As this new landscape develops, the third level institution will continue to work with the college to devise appropriate pathways for their HND students to progress onto higher-level programmes.</p></reply>

All ESF activities, including YEI activities, are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer with the EU (ESF/YEI) funding being claimed in arrears.  </p><p>The ESF authorities must be designated in accordance with the EU regulations prior to making the first payment application.  This designation is based on the opinion of the Independent Audit Body (IAB) which must be satisfied across a range of criteria that systems are in place to allow the ESF authorities to perform their required functions.  These systems requirements include the provision of a computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements.  The final phase of the IT system went live at the end of March 2018.  The ESF authorities are engaging with the IAB and it is expected that designation will be completed in the coming weeks.  </p><p>Preparations are underway for the submission of a first payment application to the Commission in Q3 2018. The European Commission has advised that the potential decommitment at end 2018 is &euro;127.7m, if not claimed in payment applications in the meantime.  The ESF authorities will ensure that sufficient payment applications are submitted to fully drawdown the EU funding allocations.</p><p>While no payment application has been made in respect of the YEI, in accordance with the ESF Regulations initial pre-financing of 3.5% and annual pre-financing for 2016 and 2017, of the EU support for the YEI priority axis, including the ESF matching financing, amounting to some &euro;8.3m has been received to date.  Separately, additional initial YEI pre-financing of &euro;19.8m was also received in line with EU Regulation 799 of 2015 but was subsequently reimbursed as Ireland did not submit an interim payment application by May 2016 for at least 50% of the amount advanced.  The reimbursement of this amount has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.  </p><p>The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  </p><p>Seven activities were originally selected for YEI funding namely, the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA); JobBridge; JobsPlus; Momentum; Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP); T&uacute;s; and Youthreach. Improvements in the rate of youth unemployment coupled with the discontinuance of the JobBridge and Momentum schemes, had consequences for the expenditure expected on YEI activities.  Consequently, the PMC agreed to the inclusion of the Community Training Centres; the Defence Forces Employment Support Scheme (DFESS) and the planned Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) under the YEI.  The PMC agreed to the removal of the T&uacute;s, JobBridge and SICAP from the YEI, having unsuccessfully explored the potential to use Simplified Cost Option models and/or in the light of audit trail difficulties.  The current activity allocations under the YEI are:<table><tr><th>Youth   Employment Initiative (Priority 4)</th><th>ESF &euro;m</th><th>YEI &euro;m</th><th>Exchequer&euro;m</th><th>Total&euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>1.549</td><td>1.549</td><td>1.549</td><td>4.648</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus </td><td>2.664</td><td>2.664</td><td>2.664</td><td>7.992</td></tr><tr><td>Youthreach</td><td>33.719</td><td>33.719</td><td>33.719</td><td>101.156</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>4.600</td><td>4.600</td><td>4.600</td><td>13.800</td></tr><tr><td>Community Training  Centres </td><td>20.000</td><td>20.000</td><td>20.000</td><td>60.000</td></tr><tr><td>DFESS</td><td>0.280</td><td>0.280</td><td>0.280</td><td>0.840</td></tr><tr><td>YESS</td><td>5.333</td><td>5.333</td><td>5.333</td><td>16.000</td></tr><tr><td>Priority Totals</td><td>68.145</td><td>68.145</td><td>68.145</td><td>204.436</td></tr></table></p></reply>

DIF was working towards the delivery of all school buildings by the coming school year.  However, the appointment of an examiner to SCIL last month has added complexity to this process and it is not yet clear the extent to which this will impact on achievement of that timeline.  </p><p>While our clear focus remains on getting the new schools delivered as quickly as possible, the Department has been engaging with the relevant school authorities in relation to contingency plans to mitigate against any issues arising from delays in the delivery of the new school buildings.</p><p>Works on the Maynooth post-primary campus are proceeding to schedule with a completion date of May 2019. Contracts were terminated on 8 of May for work on projects in St. Colman&rsquo;s Community College, Middleton, and Col&aacute;iste an Chraoibhin, Fermoy, in Cork in the absence of agreement or a viable plan from the contractor to finish out the projects.  The Design Teams for these two projects are now preparing schedules of work necessary to complete the projects as quickly as possible.</p><p>The contract for the finishing out works at Gaelscoil Bharra, where the Department of Education and Skills is the client, was also terminated on 8 of May and the Design Team is carrying out a similar exercise for this project as is being carried out for the Cork projects.  </p><p>I have asked that a critical path for each school be prepared, with a view to completing each stage in the process as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Many of the issues identified were complex and the Council commissioned the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) to carry out research to inform its deliberations.</p>  <p>  The changes also had regard to the Department&rsquo;s policy &ldquo;Supporting a Better Transition from Second Level to Higher Education &ndash; Implementation and Next Steps&rdquo; (2015).</p>  <p>  In determining the revised entry requirements, care was taken not to disadvantage those students who have already commenced the senior cycle and who intend sitting the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2018.  Accordingly, I decided that the minimum entry grades for primary Initial Teacher Education programmes should be increased for 2019 rather than from 2018.  However, to have applied this criterion to undergraduate students who might wish to apply for the PME at some time in the future, it would mean deferring the changes for four years or more.  In the case of graduates who do not meet the new Irish entry requirement, the Deputy might wish to note that there are a number of options available in this regard.</p>  <p>  The revision of entry criteria for primary initial teacher education is part of a wider range of actions being implemented or developed to achieve the objective of developing the continuum of teacher education to equip teachers with the right skills for 21st century teaching and learning, and the overall vision of making the Irish education and training system the best in Europe over the next decade.  The changes seek to ensure that primary teachers have the capacity to lead in significant and fundamental areas of student learning: English, Irish and Maths.</p>  <p>  Further changes to the minimum entry requirements from 2021 onwards will be considered in the light of experience, relevant policy developments and following consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I do not plan to further adjust the minimum entry requirements or to allow exemptions to the requirements, in advance of this.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.  Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools.  This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year.  This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of the additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>   - Utilising existing unused capacity with a school or schools,</p>  <p>   - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>   - Provision of a new school(s).</p>  <p>  My Department also engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF).</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.  Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.</p>  <p>  I have indicated that the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.</p>  <p>  The criteria for the appointment of an administrative deputy principal to a school, which are enrolment related, are set out in Appendix B of Circular, 0010/2018.  There is no scope to deviate from these arrangements.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The general approach taken in cases of amalgamation is that the existing staff of the pre-amalgamation schools can remain in the newly amalgamated school.  Where this results in the newly amalgamated school having more staff than that warranted by the staffing schedule, a concessionary allocation is given to the school to allow all of the teachers remain in place.  The concessionary post is only retained until such time as one of the existing cohort of teachers leaves the newly amalgamated school and, as such, is not a permanent allocation but is a temporary measure to assist in the amalgamation process.</p>  <p>  Any invitations or meeting requests can be forwarded to diary@education.gov.ieand they will be considered.</p></reply>

Under the PPP arrangement, the PPP company, InspiredSpaces, had a construction works contract with Carillion Construction Ltd, which further sub-contracted to Sammon Contracting Ireland Ltd (SCIL).</p><p>When Carillion Construction Ltd went into liquidation, their works contract was terminated. DIF, one of the shareholders in the PPP company, tendered for a replacement contractor for the completion of the buildings.  DIF was working towards the delivery of all school buildings by the coming school year.  However, the appointment of an examiner to SCIL last month has added complexity to this process and it is not yet clear the extent to which this will impact on achievement of that timeline.</p><p>While our clear focus remains on getting the new schools delivered as quickly as possible, the Department has been engaging with the relevant school authorities in relation to contingency plans to mitigate against any issues arising from delays in the delivery of the new school buildings.</p><p>In the case of all school building projects, it is a matter for sub-contractors and suppliers to agree terms and conditions and a schedule of payments with the main contractor as their direct employer or customer.  We are aware of reports that some sub-contractors to Sammon have not been paid for work undertaken.  While we appreciate the very difficult situation faced by sub-contractors in this situation, neither the Department nor NDFA are party to, nor have visibility of, the contractual and payment arrangements or transactions between Sammon and its sub-contractors, and we do not have authority to intervene on those matters.</p><p>In any event, the examiner appointed to Sammon Contracting Ireland Ltd will have a key role in this regard during the examinership period.</p></reply>

Future years' allocations will be determined through the normal budgetary process which takes account of competing demands and the overall availability of resources.  However, as part of the 2019 estimates process my Department is currently reviewing the per capita costing for both craft based and consortia led apprenticeships.  This exercise involves collecting detailed data from both SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority and, when completed, will provide a more accurate base from which future funding requirements can be established to meet the targets set out in our Apprenticeship Action Plan.</p></reply>

My Department and SOLAS are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector.  Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to the wet trades, as the Deputy is aware SOLAS, in partnership with Construction Industry Federation (CIF) and Waterford Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB), operated a pilot initiative in the last year to test the viability of a shared apprenticeship scheme.  Following analysis of the pilot outcomes and in consultation with both the CIF and WWETB, I understand that SOLAS decided not to operationalise the pilot initiative more widely.  In particular, it was found that the pilot did not attract employers in sufficient numbers to suggest that the scheme had the potential to have a significant impact on apprenticeship recruitment.  However, I understand from SOLAS that they are currently in discussions with representatives from the construction industry to assess how the scheme could be made more viable.</p></reply>

This Policy, which was published in October 2016, following widespread public consultation is a comprehensive policy which sets out a wide range of actions that are consistent with the Government&rsquo;s 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and is one of the Department&rsquo;s commitments included in its Action Plan for Education 2016&ndash;2019.The phased implementation of this Policy commenced in 2017.</p><p>The overarching goal of the Policy<i></i>is to ensure the availability of a high quality and relevant Irish-medium education in Gaeltacht schools and, in this way, to support and encourage the use of Irish in Gaeltacht communities.  The focus of the Department&rsquo;s Policy will be on strengthening Irish-medium education in existing schools in a manner that will provide for the differing and distinctive needs of both native speakers and learners of Irish.  The Policy also supports the implementation of immersion education (tumoideachas).</p><p>Circulars 0034/2017 and 0022/2018 set out the process involved in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme<i></i>for post-primary schools in the Gaeltacht.  These schools were invited to express an interest in the Scheme and were required to involve the school community in the decision-making process involved.  27 of the possible 28 post-primary schools located in Gaeltacht language-planning areas have expressed an interest in the Scheme to date.  A further opportunity has been provided to any remaining school in the Gaeltacht to participate in the Scheme, following consultation with their school community, so that the school can access the additional supports available to strengthen the quality of Irish-medium education. </p><p>The criteria for recognition as a Gaeltacht School includes a requirement for schools to develop a whole-school action plan for improvement to set out how the school will, on a phased basis, to take steps necessary to ensure the use of Irish as the language of communication, instruction and socialisation within the school.  The school is also required to promote the benefits of learning Irish and learning through Irish to the school community.  The specific content of these plans is a matter for each individual school to consider as it applies to its own unique sociolinguistic context and school community.</p><p>In the case of schools not opting to participate in the Scheme, such schools will continue to access the supports that are available for other English-medium schools with similar enrolments.  The supports provided under the Gaeltacht Schools Recognition Scheme and the Policy on Gaeltacht Education are additional to this. </p><p>Parallel provision of Irish-medium and English-medium educational provision is already available in some Gaeltacht areas, particularly those that are immediately adjacent to areas not designated as within the boundaries of the Gaeltacht.  As highlighted in the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022, it is not intended during the lifetime of this Policy to extend parallel provision to Gaeltacht areas where such is not currently available.</p></reply>

A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,100 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan).  Those schools have now been upgraded to that connectivity.  This represents more than one third of all primary schools.  This is a significant improvement over recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012.  Further schools are likely to be upgraded to those speeds in 2018, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment. </p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and as noted access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan.  An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision.</p>  <p>  In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, this school is currently on a 12 Mbp/s wireless connection.  The school was included in a recent mini competition run by my Department and has been awarded to a provider of high speed fibre broadband.  The provider, a new provider to the schools broadband scheme, is currently working to complete works on the interconnector to the schools broadband network. </p>  <p>  The next phase in the process will be the connection to the fibre service by the provider.  The school will be contacted by the provider in due course to arrange the installation of the fibre service.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) is currently being developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences are currently collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies.</p>  <p>  An initial phased start-up is envisaged for the new schools, which typically involves the use of interim accommodation.  However, this is the first time the requirement for new schools is set out over a 4-year horizon and this will provide a better lead-in period for the planning and delivery of permanent accommodation solutions.  </p>  <p>  In line with the policy on the use of state assets (Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circulars 11/15 and 17/16), my Department will be seeking to maximize the use of sites already in my ownership and of available properties in the ownership of other State bodies, where these are considered suitable.</p>  <p>  In addition as part of my Department's ongoing engagement with Local Authorities in respect of statutory planning processes and under the MoU on school site acquisitions, my Department will be examining all potential suitable site options, including appropriately zoned sites, to serve the relevant areas. </p>  <p>  Taking into account all of the above, decisions will then be made as part of the site acquisition process in relation to appropriate sites for all the schools announced, including the areas referred to by the Deputy, and will be confirmed at a later date.</p></reply>

From 2013 to 2017, ten multi-denominational schools have opened under the patronage divesting process.  </p>  <p>  The previous model of divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons.  The divestment model does not involve building new schools but requires the availability of school premises vacated, for example, due to amalgamation or closure.</p>  <p>  I believe that the new schools reconfiguration for diversity process, which will involve the transfer of live schools, has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system with a target of reaching 400 multi-denominational and non-denominational schools by 2030.  Already the first reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School opening in September 2017 under the "Early Movers" provision of this new process.</p>  <p>  There is no one model that will provide a universal answer to this complex issue and a number of different approaches have been adopted in the context of an expanding population and an increasing demand for multi-denominational education.  Therefore, the schools reconfiguration for diversity process will be implemented alongside a number of existing approaches, including the patronage divesting process, voluntary reassignments of patronage under Section 8 of the Education Act, 1989 and the patronage process for new schools, which includes consideration of parental preferences for different types of school patron.</p></reply>

This compares to 548 special classes in 2011.</p>  <p>  1,048 of the 1,304 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD, compared to 330 ASD classes in 2011. This number will increase to 1,180 for 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  My Department's policy aims to ensure that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with Autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.</p>  <p>  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. </p>  <p>  Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p>  <p>  Other children may have such complex needs that the recommendation in their professional reports state that they are best placed in a special school. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p>  <p>  There are currently 4 special schools and 70 special classes in the County referred to the Deputy, including 62 ASD special classes, with 5 new ASD classes opening in September 2018. </p>  <p>  The NCSE continues to progress the planning process to ensure that all students in with Special Educational Needs can access school placements appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year and beyond. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children in Kildare who will require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.</p>  <p>  In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit (SNU) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  Typically, a two classroom unit is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom unit is provided in new post primary schools.</p>  <p>  In the case of existing schools, where a school is not in a position to accommodate a special class within its existing accommodation, it is open to the school to submit an application to the Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation.</p></reply>

We start from a strong base in the school sector: standards in literacy and numeracy have risen over the lifetime of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and the performance of our students on international assessments of reading, Mathematics and Science is strong at primary and post-primary levels.</p>  <p>Despite these excellent results, there remain some challenges to achieving the vision in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 to provide the best education and training system in Europe.  These include:</p>  <p>   - Improving numeracy outcomes for all students</p>  <p>   - Tackling educational disadvantage</p>  <p>   - Enabling higher-achieving students to reach their full potential</p>  <p>   - Embedding achievements gained in literacy, with a particular focus on literacy for and through the Irish language and digital literacy.</p>  <p>  Progress towards meeting those challenges is already underway and specific, measureable, actions are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education 2018.  I don&rsquo;t underestimate these challenges but remain confident that they will be met through the commitment and effort of Early Years practitioners, teachers and school leaders, parents and staff in support services of various types, teacher educators, and a range of other bodies, agencies and organisations.    </p>  <p>  In relation to higher education, Ireland is in the top 5 positions in Europe in terms of participation and in the top 10 positions in terms of educational attainment.  The participation rate of 18-20 year olds in higher education has grown from 20% in 1980 to a current level of 58%.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of 30-34 year olds with higher education attainment in the OECD with over half of 25-34 year olds having completed higher education.</p>  <p>  In 2016/17 there were 43,569 new full-time undergraduate entrants into higher education.  This represents a 10% increase in the last 5 years.  79% of new entrants went into an Honours Bachelor Degree programme.  In total there are 225,628 students enrolled in higher education in Ireland.  Over 6% of the country&rsquo;s adult population is now enrolled in a higher education programme.  The latest HEA report &ldquo;A study of progression in Irish HE 2014/15 to 2015/16&rdquo; indicates that 86% of first year students progressed to their second year.</p>  <p>  In terms of investment, Budget 2018 saw investment in higher and further education increasing &euro;100 million above 2016 levels.  This will allow for an additional 2,100 student places to be provided this year.  There is also a significant ramping up of Government investment on the capital side of the higher education sector and over a 10 year period, investment of some &euro;2.2 billion is envisaged.</p>  <p>  The focus of the Action Plan for Education 2018 is on excellence and innovation.  In the higher education sector there is a new Systems Performance Framework and new funding arrangements are being put in place.  These will see more funding for STEM courses, the introduction of an Innovation Fund and a performance fund to reward institutions who excel in particular areas, as well as new funding streams for research and incentivised life-long, part-time and flexible learning opportunities.</p>  <p>  The Further Education and Training (FET) sector has undergone transformational reform in recent years bringing together Further Education and Training as a single sector to firmly establish it as the fourth pillar of the national education system.  The Further Education and Training Strategy 2014-2019   sets out a vision to transform the sector to deliver a world-class integrated system of further education and training that will support economic development, increase social inclusion and to meet the needs of all who engage with FET.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Technological Universities Act 2018 was signed into law on 19 March 2018.  This is a sea-change in the higher education landscape and provides the legal framework for the establishment of a new type of higher education institution, building on the strengths of individual institutions but achieving a greater critical mass and scale.  Technological universities will provide an opportunity to drive regional development and provide more opportunities for students, staff, enterprise and local and regional communities.  They will have a significant reach, impact and influence regionally, nationally and internationally.  Already the first application for TU designation was made last month by DIT, IT Blanchardstown and IT Tallaght and three other consortia, comprising 7 IoTs, are working towards making applications.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a strong track record, too, in research and innovation, and Irish researchers have been very successful under Horizon 2020&rsquo;s highly competitive international funding stream.  Under Horizon 2020, to January 2018 Irish researchers had secured funding to the value of &euro;513 million, of which nearly 53% was won by higher education institutions.  In 2016, we achieved a world ranking of 10th for the overall quality of our scientific research, an increase of 26 places in only 13 years; and we also made significant improvements in our global rankings for individual subjects, for example, we are 2nd in the world for nanotechnology, Animal and Dairy, and Immunology; 3rd for Material Sciences and Agricultural Sciences; and 4th for Mathematics.  In 2016/17 there were 7,962 full time enrolments in postgraduate research.  Total full time enrolment in postgraduate programmes has increased from 21,780 in 2012/13 to 23,092 in 2016/17.</p></reply>

As a result of these changes, children of minority religions will be able access such schools. Unlike Catholic schools and Catholic families, these communities need this protection if they are going to continue to be able to access schools of their own religious ethos.  </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously this is a complex area and there are no easy solutions to this problem but I believe that the approach taken is a reasonable and proportionate approach to balance the rights of all. </p></reply>

The National Council for Special Education notified the schools of their SNA allocations on Friday last and the details of these allocations are now published and available on their website.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that the total allocation for County Kildare for September 2018 has been increased from 584.63 to 629.37, an increase of 26.4 for primary schools, an increase of 16.5 for secondary schools and an additional 2 SNAs for special schools.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that children with special educational needs are supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for this Government. In the region of &euro;1.75 billion will be invested in Special Education in 2018, nearly one fifth of the overall Education budget, and up 43% since 2011. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-22a.603.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052200068#WRM00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251, 265 to 267, inclusive, and 269 together.</p>  <p>  The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, published in January 2017, was prepared by the Cost of Insurance Working Group which is currently chaired by my colleague, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for Financial Services and Insurance. I and my Department, and its relevant agencies, continue to support the Chair and members of the Working Group in their working objective to identify immediate and longer term measures which can address increasing costs, while bearing in mind the need to maintain a stable insurance sector.  Moreover, my Department continues to discuss these matters and those recommendations arising in appropriate detail and directly with the membership of the Working Group which also includes the Department of Finance, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Central Bank of Ireland, the State Claims Agency and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</p>  <p>  In replying to the series of Questions from Deputy McGrath, I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the Department of Finance produces regular quarterly updates on the progress of the main Report of the Working Group on the Cost of Insurance by reference to the specific recommendations made including those which fall to my Department. The most recent of these, publicly available on the website of the Department of Finance, is the Fifth Quarterly Progress Update which was published on 11 May 2018.  This latest update also includes details of the implementation of the Action Plan of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public liability Insurance published by the Working Group in January 2018. In replying to each of the recommendations that have been raised by Deputy McGrath I will, therefore, be reflecting the content of the Fifth Quarterly Progress Update as it relates to my Department.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 16 of the Motor Report seeks to ascertain and set out the measures necessary to implement pre-action protocols for personal injury cases.  Draft Heads have been prepared by my Department to provide for regulations on the use of such protocols. The draft Heads are being discussed further with the a view to their being agreed in this Quarter. It should also be remembered that their introduction is being informed by the development of such protocols for medical negligence cases under Part 15 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 for which I expect to issue the relevant regulations soon.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 22 of the Motor Report is to examine the impact of legal and other fees on personal injury awards.  While the review has been commenced, definitive conclusions from somewhat limited available data have been difficult to draw to date.  However, in the context of the set-up of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators which is to replace that of the Taxing-Master under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, a new publicly accessible Register of Determinations is to be maintained which will provide enhanced data for such purposes.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 23 of the Motor Report is to review the impact of the changes to the court jurisdictional limits as they evolve.  The Courts Service has provided my Department a first provisional data set which is being analysed at present and matters are on track for a report to be submitted to the Working Group by the required deadline of Q2 2018.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 24 of the Motor Report is to examine the setting of the discount rate in personal injury lump sum awards.  My Department is examining this issue in consultation with the Department of Finance and the State Claims Agency with whom it has also met specifically on this issue. As part of this work, account is being taken of recent Irish case law and of relevant developments in the United Kingdom and their potential applicability in an Irish context. The relevant findings will be brought soon for consideration by the Working Group.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 27 of the Motor Report is to review section 30 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which provides that the Courts Service will establish and maintain a register of personal injuries actions.  While the development of the register has been progressed by the Courts Service there are some issues of a technical and data protection nature which have arisen and require further consideration.  The Courts Service may wish to propose amendments to section 30 and intends to report on these aspects in Q2 2018.  My Department will consider this report when it is received in consultation with the Working Group.</p>  <p>  My commitment and that of my Department to the Cost of Insurance Working Group is reflected in the fact that my Department and its relevant agencies have the lead in the implementation of 8 of the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and 9 of the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance. This commitment is also reflected in the continuing and active participation of officials of my Department in the deliberations of the Working Group and those of its Legal Sub-Group as well as in the work of the Personal Injuries Commission which has been set up on recommendation of the Working Group. We continue to work closely with Minister of State D'Arcy as Chair and with other members of the Working Group in support of insurance costs reform under this key Government initiative.</p></reply>

It is not therefore within the remit of my Department to amend or introduce new regulations in relation to the Atypical Worker Scheme for Sea Fishers and any changes to the scheme would in the first instance be a matter for the Oversight Committee and the relevant Departments and would also require the approval of Government.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of my Department's commitment, in conjunction with relevant Government Departments and State Agencies, to ensure appropriate legislation and regulations are in place to prevent trafficking and protect potential victims of trafficking, regardless of the circumstances in which it arises.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware the Monasterevin Garda Station forms part of the Kildare District in the Kildare Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Kildare Division was 365, of whom 129 and 5 were assigned to the Kildare District and Monasterevin Garda Station respectively. There are also 19 Garda Reserves and 30 civilians attached to the Division.</p>  <p>  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Commissioner that Monasterevin Garda Station is open daily from 10.00am - 1.00pm daily subject to the operational requirements of the Division.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 85 members have been assigned to the Kildare Division.

There are also 16 Garda Reserves and 30 civilians attached to the Division.

To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 59 members have been assigned to the Meath Division.

Section 26 of the Act requires a court to dismiss a personal injuries claim where the plaintiff gives evidence that is false or misleading and that he or she knows to be false or misleading, or causes false or misleading evidence to be given with the intention of misleading the court, unless dismissal of the action would result in injustice being done.</p>  <p>  However, section 25 of the Act provides that it is an offence for a person to give or adduce evidence in a personal injuries action that is false or misleading and that the person knows to be false or misleading, or to cause false or misleading evidence to be given or adduced with the intention of misleading the court.  It is also an offence for a person to give false or misleading instructions or information to a solicitor or expert in relation to a personal injuries action or to cause false or misleading instructions or information to be given with the intention of misleading the court.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that statistics are not compiled in such a way as to provide information with regard to the number of convictions arising under section 25 of the Act.  I have requested the Courts Service to examine the requirements, including system development and resource issues, needed to enable the compiling of such statistics going forward.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to be aware that the issue of fraud in the personal injuries litigation area is being examined as part of the ongoing work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which is chaired by my colleague Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, and an initial roundtable was convened by the Department of Finance in late 2017 to listen to the views of all of the key stakeholders in relation to insurance fraud. In January 2018, the Working Group produced its &lsquo;Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance&rsquo; which includes a number of specific recommendations in relation to the production of statistics by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service on complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 13 of the Working Group's employer and public liability insurance report recommends that Insurance Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions agree a set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims. While guidelines were published in 2004, the Working Group noted that these have only been used to a very limited extent over the years and proposed that a new set of guidelines should be developed, using the 2004 protocol as a starting point. Consultations with various interested parties on the proposed guidelines have taken place and it is anticipated that a new set of guidelines will be completed during Quarter 3 2018.</p>  <p>  It should be noted also that the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaging with my Department on an ongoing basis in relation to the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to note that the Department of Finance issues regular quarterly updates on its website of the progress of the respective reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, the latest and Fifth Quarterly Progress Update having been published on 11 May 2018.</p></reply>

The youths in question then proceeded to engage in other serious anti-social behaviour and accost members of the public. This is completely unacceptable behaviour and will not be tolerated. I am advised that this incident is now the subject of an official investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with Irish Rail, with CCTV footage being reviewed to help identify the culprits. Photographs were also taken at the scene of the &lsquo;graffiti tags&rsquo; which are also being circulated in order to identify any links with known graffiti offenders and I would encourage anyone with information about this incident to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In terms of tackling this particular type of crime, I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Garda management engages extensively with transport operators and a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations.  There is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV helps provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents, such as what we saw in Clongriffin recently.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already employs a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour. These measures are underpinned by the existence of a comprehensive legal framework, which assists the Garda&iacute; in tackling this type of crime. Of course, addressing local community concerns in relation to public order and anti-social behaviour is a key focus in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Community Policing Model and a range of strong legislative provisions are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard, including those under:</p>  <p>- the Criminal Damage Act 1991;</p>  <p>- Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;</p>  <p>- the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and</p>  <p>- the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p>  <p>  For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.</p></reply>

The Group has completed a report, which includes recommended parameters for the database, who will be responsible for administering the database and disseminating data and how the database will be funded.</p><p>The report of the Group was submitted to the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) and, in response, the ODPC has strongly endorsed the Group&rsquo;s view that detailed Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) will be required in order to justify the potential addition of new datasets to the existing Insurance Link database, and the increased sharing of data. The ODPC also recommends that further work needs to be undertaken to detail the evidential requirements for the creation of a new database or the enhancement of the existing Insurance Link database.</p><p>The application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) later this week and the related data protection legislation, which I launched with Minister of State Breen in February this year, will have a significant impact on any new data sharing arrangements between industry members and between the industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As such, the establishment of any new data sharing structures will require careful consideration against the impending changes to the legislative landscape.</p><p>As a starting point, it is necessary for a review to be undertaken by the insurance industry of the information held on Insurance Link in the context of the GDPR. It is also necessary for the industry to assess in more detail what specific additional data is proposed to be shared and in what additional circumstances such data is proposed to be shared. It is essential that a critical balance is identified to ensure that data sharing between insurers is maximised while, at the same time, the data rights of the public are protected.  Any changes, therefore, to the existing data-sharing arrangements for the purposes of Insurance Link must be proportional to their effect.</p><p>I am informed that Insurance Ireland expects to complete a detailed DPIA in this regard by the end of August 2018.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that, as further progress on Recommendation 25 will depend upon the outcome of this DPIA, it is not currently possible to provide a definitive timeframe for the establishment of the database. However, I can assure the Deputy that all action points associated with this recommendation have been completed, with the exception of the one, longer-term action relating to the preparation of criminal justice legislation, if required, and the implementation of the database. The deadlines for these long-term matters have yet to be reached (Quarters 2 and 4 of 2018 respectively) although they cannot be progressed until the DPIA has been completed by Insurance Ireland.</p><p>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding the availability of the existing Insurance Link database to participants in the Irish insurance market, I am informed that access to this database is not exclusively available through or dependent on membership of Insurance Ireland. I am further informed that the effectiveness of the database in combatting insurance fraud is boosted by the increased number of entities who use this tool. However, the recommendation in the January 2017 Cost of Insurance Working Group report was for the database &quot;<i>to be managed by an independent not-for-profit body</i>&quot; and therefore any new database must be independent of industry.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,632. There are also 562 Garda Reserves and more than 2,280 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner last week with a closing date of 6 June. The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to www.publicjobs.ie.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division. </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table the Garda strength by Divison and rank as of 30 April 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available.  </p><p>GARDA STATISTICS MONTH ENDING 30 APRIL 2018<table><tr><th>-Division</th><th>GD</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>SU</th><th>CS</th><th>AC</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>CAVAN / MONAGHAN</td><td>284</td><td>47</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>344</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE                     </td><td>262</td><td>43</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>313</td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY</td><td>572</td><td>93</td><td>9</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>682</td></tr><tr><td>CORK NORTH</td><td>267</td><td>45</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>323</td></tr><tr><td>CORK WEST</td><td>246</td><td>43</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>298</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

I now propose to set out this response below.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question on the number and names of Garda stations that are opened on a 24 hour basis, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following 109 stations are open on a 24-hour basis.</p><p><b><i>Dublin Metropolitan Region</i></b><table><tr><th>Balbriggan</th><th>Clontarf</th><th>Irishtown</th><th>Rathfarnham</th></tr><tr><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>Coolock</td><td>Kevin Street</td><td>Rathmines</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymun</td><td>Crumlin</td><td>Kilmainham</td><td>Ronanstown</td></tr><tr><td>Blackrock</td><td>Dun Laoghaire</td><td>Lucan</td><td>Shankill</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>Dundrum</td><td>Mountjoy</td><td>Store Street</td></tr><tr><td>Bridewell</td><td>Finglas</td><td>Pearse Street</td><td>Swords</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>Fitzgibbon Street</td><td>Raheny</td><td>Tallaght</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>South Eastern Region</i></b><table><tr><th>Carlow</th><th>Kilkenny</th><th>Tipperary</th><th>Waterford</th><th>Wexford</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Cahir</td><td>Dungarvan</td><td>Enniscorthy</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Clonmel</td><td>Tramore</td><td>New Ross</td></tr><tr><td>Thomastown</td><td></td><td>Nenagh</td><td>Waterford</td><td>Wexford</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Tipperary Town</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Thurles</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Southern Region</i></b><table><tr><th></th><th>Cork</th><th>Limerick</th><th>Kerry</th></tr><tr><td>Anglesea Street</td><td>Macroom</td><td>Bruff</td><td>Killarney</td></tr><tr><td>Bandon</td><td>Mallow</td><td>Henry Street</td><td>Listowel</td></tr><tr><td>Bantry</td><td>Mayfield</td><td>Newcastle West</td><td>Tralee </td></tr><tr><td>Clonakilty</td><td>Midleton</td><td>Roxboro Road</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fermoy</td><td>Togher</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gurranabraher</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Western Division</i></b><table><tr><th>Clare</th><th>Galway</th><th>Longford</th><th>Mayo</th><th>Roscommon</th></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td>Ballinasloe</td><td>Granard</td><td>Ballina</td><td>Castlerea</td></tr><tr><td>Kilrush</td><td>Clifden</td><td>Longford</td><td>Bellmullet</td><td>Roscommon</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon</td><td>Galway</td><td></td><td>Castlebar</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Gort</td><td></td><td>Claremorris</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Loughrea</td><td></td><td>Westport</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Salthill</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tuam</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Eastern Region</i></b><table><tr><th>Kildare</th><th>Laois</th><th>Meath</th><th>Offaly</th><th>Westmeath</th><th>Wicklow</th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Portlaoise</td><td>Ashbourne</td><td>Birr</td><td>Athlone</td><td>Baltinglass</td></tr><tr><td>Leixlip</td><td></td><td>Kells</td><td></td><td>Mullingar</td><td>Bray</td></tr><tr><td>Naas</td><td></td><td>Navan</td><td></td><td></td><td>Tullamore</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Trim</td><td></td><td></td><td>Wicklow</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Northern Region</i></b><table><tr><th>Cavan</th><th>Donegal</th><th>Monaghan</th><th>Leitrim</th><th>Louth</th><th>Sligo</th></tr><tr><td>Bailieboro</td><td>Ballyshannon</td><td>Carrickmacross</td><td>Carrick-on-Shannon</td><td>Drogheda</td><td>Ballymote</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>Buncrana</td><td>Castleblaney</td><td></td><td>Dundalk</td><td>Sligo</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Donegal Town</td><td>Monaghan</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Letterkenny</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Milford</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>With reference to the question regarding the number of Garda Reserve members as at the end of 2017 and the percentage that completed the minimum of 208 annual hours per annum duty obligations it is worth recalling that the Garda Reserve was established in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enhance the links between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. It consists of voluntary unpaid members, drawn from the community, to support the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, an allowance is payable to Reserve members who complete a minimum of 208 hours duty annually as a contribution towards expenses incurred in performing their duties. The allowance is currently set at &euro;1,000 per annum. Members of the Reserve are also reimbursed for expenses incurred while attending court in respect of their service in the Garda Reserve.  </p><p>The strength of the Reserve was 589 on 31 December 2017. I am informed that 205 members or 34.8% were paid the allowance in 2017.</p><p>The Deputy also asked a number of questions relating to the criteria applied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for determining whether a crime should be recorded as a burglary as opposed to a criminal damage offence, whether both crimes are recorded on the PULSE system in circumstances in which criminal damage is committed in the course of a burglary, the checks in place to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are correctly classifying crimes recorded on the PULSE system and the process and policy in place for the re-characterisation of crimes already submitted in the PULSE system.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that reviewing and re-classification of incidents, both crime and non-crime, is routine.  Incidents recorded on PULSE are subject of review by supervisors, Performance and Accountability Framework (PAF) Administrators and District Officers, as well as staff at the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) who are tasked with the recording of crime statistics. This is part of the normal process of regular review. </p><p>I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in determining whether a crime should be recorded as a burglary as opposed to criminal damage, provide that both incidents should be recorded on PULSE as both instances occurred during the same criminal incident.  Both incidents are grouped together and the most serious one is flagged for crime counting purposes in the official statistics.  This is determined by which incident carries the greatest penalty, in this case burglary would be flagged as the primary incident as it carries the greatest penalty and would be counted for official statistics.</p><p>I understand that the PULSE Classification Project is being rolled out incrementally in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This project assigns the GISC team as the classifier of PULSE incidents, thereby reducing the number of decision makers on the classification of crime and other incidents to the GISC team.  This project is operational in the Northern and Western regions and is working successfully and it will be implemented in the Eastern and South Eastern, Southern Region and the DMR over the coming months. </p><p>With reference to Parliamentary Question No. 248 concerning the number of staff serving on the unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na known as the Charleton Liaison Unit that were appointed to the position by a person, a substantive reply was given on 23 January 2018 to this question.</p></reply>

This includes identifying and progressing any necessary remedial or refurbishment works required at individual stations. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner's final report, which is available on my Department's website, recommends that Ballinspittle Garda Station be reopened, along with stations in Bawnboy, Co. Cavan, Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow, Donard, Co. Wicklow, and Rush and Stepaside, Co. Dublin.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a brief of requirements was provided to the OPW in relation to the reopening of these 6 stations, including Ballinspittle Garda Station, and that the Garda authorities requested the OPW to undertake technical surveys to determine the works which would be required to enable the stations to reopen and the estimated cost of any such works.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the OPW has now conducted the necessary technical survey and has written to the Commissioner outlining the works and estimated cost involved.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now considering that information.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the OPW remain in discussion regarding the pilot reopening.</p>  <p>  I understand that at this stage it is not possible to provide a timeframe for reopening the stations concerned, which is dependent on a number of factors.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the National Vetting Bureau works to ensure that the processing time for vetting applications is kept to the minimum necessary in order to ensure that the statutory obligation to receive a vetting disclosure prior to permitting any person to undertake relevant work or activities on behalf of an organisation can be facilitated without undue delay. </p>  <p>  Across 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, the National Vetting Bureau placed an emphasis on encouraging relevant organisations to meet their statutory obligations with regard to completing retrospective vetting arrangements, the deadline for which was 30 April 2018. </p>  <p>  While the National Vetting Bureau has the capacity to process large volumes of vetting applications over a sustained period, the retrospective vetting deadline resulted in a significant short-term increase in the volume of vetting applications received in the first quarter of this year which has resulted in the turnaround time increasing in excess of the 5-6 days target. Additional resources have been applied to address this additional demand and it is envisaged that turnaround times will reduce to the target time in the short term.</p></reply>

Either parent of a child, whether or not he or she is also a guardian of the child, may apply to court for a direction regarding custody of, or access to, the child.  Section 11(5) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the court may, of its own motion or on application, give directions to procure a report from such person as it may nominate on any question affecting the welfare of the child. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Article 42A.4.1 of the Constitution requires that provision be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings concerning the guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration. Article 42A.4.2 requires that provision be made by law for securing, as far as practicable, that in all such proceedings in respect of any child who is capable of forming his or her own views, the views of the child shall be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.  </p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contains provisions regarding the best interests of children in family law proceedings which have been in operation since 18 January 2016. Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as amended by section 45 of the 2015 Act, provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in proceedings where the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  </p>  <p>  The best interests of a child are to be determined in accordance with the new Part V of the 1964 Act, inserted by section 63 of the 2015 Act.  Part V, entitled &ldquo;Best Interests of the Child&rdquo;, contains two important sections.  </p>  <p>  Section 31 sets out an extensive list of factors and circumstances to be taken into account by a court when determining the best interests of a child.  These include the views of the child that are ascertainable (whether in accordance with section 32 or otherwise). The court can ascertain the views of the child in person or through an expert.  Section 31(6) provides that in obtaining the ascertainable views of a child, the court shall facilitate the free expression by the child of those views and endeavour to ensure that any views expressed by the child are not expressed as a result of undue influence, and may make an order under section 32.</p>  <p>  Section 32 facilitates the hearing of the voice of the child by enabling the court to appoint an expert to determine and convey the child&rsquo;s views to the court, so that the child&rsquo;s voice can be heard in the proceedings.   </p>  <p>  These provisions allow the courts to take account of the evolving capacity of children and also give the courts the flexibility to ensure that all children&rsquo;s views can be heard.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The conduct of any case relating to section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and the arrangements made in such a case to enable the voice of the child to be heard are a matter for the presiding judge, subject to the legislative provisions set out above.</p></reply>

A considerable amount of research into approaches in other jurisdictions has been carried out along with a consultation exercise with the medical community and key stakeholder groups. The responses received to this consultation are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.dbei.gov.ie. The First Report of the PIC sets out the detail of the consultation.</p>  <p>  This research and consultation has informed the key findings of the Commission&rsquo;s First Report which suggest that adopting a standardised and internationally recognised approach to the diagnosis, treatment and reporting of soft tissue injuries will improve the personal injuries environment in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The PIC produced its first Report which was approved by Government and published on 7 December 2017. The Report recommends that the Quebec Task Force (QTF) Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) grading scale should be used going forward by all medical professionals reporting on relevant injuries. These are internationally recognised scales based on severity of symptoms and associated physical signs.  A standardised medical reporting template is included in the Report.</p>  <p>  The Report recommends that training and accreditation of medical professionals who complete personal injury medical reports should be promoted.</p>  <p>  The Report also recommends the linking of future publications of the Book of Quantum to the newly standardised examination and reporting injury categories.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Report recommends that relevant injury data should be collated and published by appropriate bodies.  The Commission also suggests that there may be merit that data available from insurers relating to the incidence of &lsquo;whiplash&rsquo; soft-tissue injuries, forms part of the National Claims Information Database which is being developed by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The next Report of the Personal Injuries Commission will predominately deal with benchmarking of Irish awards with international awards.  Independent consultants have been engaged to carry out the data validation/verification of the data received and work with the Personal Injuries Commission on the benchmarking exercise. This Report is expected in June/July 2018 subject to the completion of the validation/verification exercise and will include any recommendations arising from the deliberations of the Commission. The Report will be the Final Report as the second and third reports will be merged.</p>  <p>  When the Final Report is submitted to me, I intend to bring it to Government and publish it soon after.</p></reply>

The Group was formed in March 2016 and Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland (RAI), the Irish Hotels Federation, the Irish Hospitality Institute, Licensed Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI),Technological Higher Education Association(THEA), Quality and Qualifications Ireland, Regional Skills Dublin and the Departments of  Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Education and Skills and Employment and Social Protection. </p><p>The Group is aware that the hospitality sector is very diverse with many different kinds of employers and occupations. As a result, different priorities and needs have emerged within the industry.  While F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a defined role for the development of tourism enterprises, many of the constituent hospitality businesses fall outside of the tourism sector. Areas such as contract catering, institutional catering, artisan food production, delicatessens etc are all sources of employment for trained hospitality staff. </p><p>The Group focused on the following priority areas between March 2016 and March 2018:</p><p><b>-Promoting careers in the hospitality industry</b></p><p>The hospitality sector has suffered from poor career perception in the past.  Since the establishment of the Oversight Group in 2016, the IHF, IHI in partnership with FI came together and launched a National Tourism Careers Programme.  The programme is being run in close collaboration with tourism and hospitality businesses and is designed to enable second-level students aged 15-18 to explore the full range of exciting career paths and educational and training options available all over the country.  The Irish Hotels Federation&rsquo;s &ldquo;Get a Life in Tourism&rdquo; is an example of a positive response to the challenges of attracting new entrants to the industry.  The Careers Roadshow undertaken by the IHF, IHI and Tralee demonstrates how effective collaboration can yield positive outcomes.  Tourism Insight is another positive development resulting from collaboration between IHI, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, IHF, Tralee and regional skills fora.It is an interactive online programme for students and teachers featuring tutorials and videos, which can be delivered as part of class in school or for students to complete in their own time at home. The Transition Year programme was launched in September 2016.</p><p><b>-  Audits of hospitality-related courses and facilities in further and higher education</b></p><p>The Audit of Hospitality Courses in Further and Higher Education Report was published in November 2017. This report was commissioned by SOLAS and the HEA on behalf of the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group. It provides a high level of analysis of the data available that shows the alignment of skills provision against identified gaps in the hospitality sector. The HSOG is considering a proposal to carry out a pilot exercise into facilities and capabilities in specific geographical areas.  The pilot project would look at a designated geographical area where a FE and HE institution exist and audit the equipment, space and downtime available.</p><p><b>-  Development of apprenticeship and traineeship programmes</b></p><p>The Oversight Group sees apprenticeships as an alternative model of learning and an opportunity for certain cohorts of learners to start on the pathway of a career in a variety of sectors, including hospitality. The Commis Chef Apprenticeship Programme was launched in January 2018 and will take place in the ETBs - led by Kerry ETB.  The apprenticeship will involve two days in training and 3 days in work. This will lead to a Level 6 award and will take two years to complete.</p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning. As of late 2017, eight hospitality programmes have been completed in 4 ETBs (Laois &amp;amp; Offaly ETB, Limerick &amp;amp; Clare ETB, Mayo, Sligo &amp;amp; Leitrim ETB and Cavan&amp;amp; Monaghan ETB). One programme is currently running in Louth &amp;amp; Meath ETB.  5 programmes are currently planned for Limerick&amp;amp; Clare ETB, Kildare &amp;amp; Wicklow ETB, Kilkenny &amp;amp; Carlow ETB, Donegal ETB &amp;amp; Kerry ETB.</p><p>There is considerable scope within the Career Traineeships to provide a range of craft level skills training in supported employments. This model compares well against the much commented upon former CERT training model. The Group notes that early indicators are that the participating enterprises are very satisfied with the traineeship approach.</p><p><b>-  Launch of Skillnets for the hospitality industry</b></p><p>Skillnet Ireland is a national body with responsibility for the promotion of enterprise-led training. It is funded through the National Training Fund by the Department of Education and Skills. The RAI-promoted Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet was formally launched by Minister Bruton in March 2017 to help drive employment growth, talent attraction and retention in the hospitality sector, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels. </p><p>Skillnet Ireland has a rolling Expression of Interest process open to new applicants, and in April 2017 a second hospitality-sector network was approved, the Tourism &amp;amp; Food Skillnet. Promoted by Ballyhoura Development CLG, this network was developed to address the skills needs of tourism and food businesses in a rural catchment area in the south-west region. The training plan in year one comprises a mix of courses on digital marketing, business skills and sector -specific technical skills. As Skillnet Ireland continues to seek to develop new networks to expand its reach, the Expression of Interest process remains open to interested parties including the hospitality sector.</p><p>-<b>Connecting people with jobs through initiatives of the Department of Social Protection</b></p><p>As part of its role in providing supports and information to unemployed people, the Department of Employment and Social Protection (DEASP) helps to match jobseekers with employers and vacancies, including in the hospitality sector. The jobsireland.ie website is the national job matching service run by the DEASP.  Vacancies advertised on the Jobs Ireland website are also promoted through the EURES service to maximise awareness of the opportunities across Europe.  A proposal regarding a recruitment campaign in Portugal was submitted for consideration by RAI and an invitation extended to participate in the European Online Job Fairs.  Ongoing support for recruitment has been offered and availed of by employers in the hospitality sector.  </p></reply>

The leadership and management development programmes delivered by EI are a critical support for the scaling agenda and improving business performance.  Enterprise Ireland runs a range of training programmes to assist entrepreneurs and companies to develop the skills required to start and develop a business; develop export selling capabilities; and further enhance and develop leadership and management development capabilities.</p><p>EI&rsquo;s customised management development programmes are described in the following table and act to support companies with global ambition to start, scale and internationalise.  These training programmes are open to large, medium and small enterprises.<table><tr><th>Management Training Course</th></tr><tr><td>Leadership 4 Growth <br /><br />Delivered in  conjunction with Stanford University this flagship programme is designed to   develop and enhance the leadership ambition, mindset and capability of Irish CEOs and their senior management teams to lead innovative, scalable companies, capable of achieving sustained international growth.</td></tr><tr><td>Innovation 4 Growth <br /><br />Targeted at ambitious companies seeking to drive growth through innovation, this programme supports companies through an end-to-end innovation learning and practice journey to deliver on one or more innovation initiatives.</td></tr><tr><td>Go Global 4 Growth <br /><br />Go Global 4 Growth is targeted at ambitious SME top teams from all sectors, committed to adapting and evolving their business functions to prepare for global growth. The programme offers participants world-class, SME-customised management education, delivered by   Ireland's fastest growing University, Dublin City University.</td></tr><tr><td>International Selling Programme <br /><br />Targeting company management and sales staff, this 10-month programme enhances company ability to access new markets and accelerates export sales growth. Delivered in conjunction with Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) in partnership with a panel of world-class experts and practitioners.</td></tr><tr><td>HPSU Founders Forum<br /><br />The HPSU Founders Forum has been created for CEO Founders who are HPSU Accelerate   clients and who have typically received Enterprise Ireland investment support. The Forum brings together CEO Founders who are committed to building and scaling their companies internationally.</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition, there are a number of short programmes that are supported by EI.</p><p>The following table presents the 2018 budget allocation for management training programmes and the associated estimated number of participants.  As these training programmes are open to large, medium and small companies, EI is not in a position to provide a budget allocation and estimated participation rate for SMEs for 2018.<table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>2018 EI Allocation<br /><br />(Estimate)</th><th>No. of Companies 2018<br /><br />(Estimate)</th><th>No. of Participants 2018 <br /><br />(Estimate)</th></tr><tr><td>Leadership 4 Growth</td><td>1.584m</td><td>60</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Innovation 4 Growth</td><td>218k</td><td>15</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Go Global 4 Growth</td><td>623.5k</td><td>42</td><td>158</td></tr><tr><td>International Selling Programme</td><td>758k</td><td>90</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Founders Forum</td><td>210k</td><td>60</td><td>60 </td></tr></table></p><p>EI will continue to review the management development training needs of companies to ensure that the agency can address the training needs of companies with global ambition.</p><p>The supports offered by the LEOs can be broadly classified as falling under two general headings, (1) grant support, and (2) capability development.  The capability development supports offered by the LEOs are primarily programmes which facilitate entrepreneurial capability, mentoring, training and development. It should be noted that the Management Development Programmes offered by the LEOs are not grants to businesses, they are subsidised or free, depending on the specific programme.</p><p>The initial 2018 budget allocation for entrepreneurial capability, mentoring, training and development programmes for the LEOs is &euro;7,997,750.  This figure is allocated at the individual LEO level, and is not prescriptive in terms of the allocation for management development and business appraisal training programmes.</p><p>The 2018 LEO Performance targets in respect of training and mentoring are as follows:<table><tr><th>Performance Metrics</th><th>2018 Target</th></tr><tr><td>Total No. of Training Courses</td><td>1,800</td></tr><tr><td>Total No. of Training Participants</td><td>28,000</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Core Training Programmes</td><td>1,520</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Start Your Own Business Training   Programmes</td><td>280</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Mentoring Participants</td><td>7,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The construction sector SEO was the first Order made under this legislation and came into effect in October 2017. </p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for a new framework under which proposals for wage setting in particular sectors can be considered.  The 2015 legislation was in response to the striking down on constitutional grounds of the previous regime of Registered Employment Agreements. </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act allows for applications to be submitted to the Labour Court either separately or jointly by worker or employer bodies that are substantially representative in the sector concerned.  In the case of the construction sector SEO, the application was made to the Labour Court by an employer body.  The Court undertook its examination of the application in line with the legislation and this included a public consultation process with advertisements in the national print media seeking submissions to the application received by the Labour Court. </p>  <p>  I would stress that it is open in this process for any interested party to make a submission to the Labour Court.  Parties that make a submission to the Court are subsequently invited to a further oral hearing at the Labour Court.  I understand that in the submissions made to the Labour Court, none of these contained any significant reference to the impact of the introduction of an SEO for the construction sector on State contracts already signed. </p>  <p>  Following examination by the Labour Court of the application based on submissions received, the oral hearing and drawing on the Court's knowledge and expertise in considering industrial relations aspects of the SEO application, the Court submitted a recommendation to me in favour of making a Ministerial Order for the construction sector.        </p>  <p>  I have no function in the determination of the terms of the SEO which under legislation is a matter solely for the Labour Court.  As Minister, my role under the legislation is to ensure that the Labour Court has undertaken the process for examination of an application in line with the criteria set down in the 2015 legislation including.  On that basis, I can either accept or reject the Labour Court recommendation.</p>  <p>  In the case of the construction SEO, I accepted the Labour Court recommendation and confirmed it by Ministerial Order which had to be approved in advance by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The terms of the Order that set out the new rates payable in the construction sector came into effect from 19 October 2017.</p>  <p>  As Minister at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation I am of course very conscious of the implications of wage increases on sectors of the economy.  I am equally aware of the importance of maintaining industrial peace in sectors of the economy that are critical to the continued growth of our economy and are providing critical services. </p></reply>

This initial application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit.  The SBCI assesses these applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank with Allied Irish Bank following in June.  Approval of loans are subject to the finance providers own credit policies and procedures.   </p>  <p>  The Scheme was launched on 28 March this year and metrics describing its uptake will be available at the end of Quarter 2, 2018.</p></reply>

The Court was of the view that the employer and the trade union would benefit from constructive dialogue facilitated by an external expert and the Court was prepared to nominate an appropriate experienced person.</p>  <p>  I would urge both sides to this dispute to remain engaged with the State's industrial relations machinery in order to resolve their differences. </p></reply>

There are 3 LEO offices in County Cork; Cork City, Cork North/West and Cork South.  Funding is allocated among the LEOs to support clients through the provision of grants (Measure 1) and soft supports (Measure 2), such as training and mentoring, and used to fund the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) programme.  Details of the total funds drawn down by the 3 Cork LEO&rsquo;s since 1 January 2018 to date is set out in the table.  <table><tr><th>LEO Name</th><th>Total Drawdown 1st Jan 2018 to 17th May 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>&euro;435,924</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North/West</td><td>&euro;544,924</td></tr><tr><td>Cork South</td><td>&euro;250,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total Drawdown</td><td>&euro;1,230,848</td></tr></table></p><p>The LEOs are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone who intends to start or grow their own business.  There are 31 LEO&rsquo;s located nationally.  In the first instance, the LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, Credit Review Office, and Microfinance Ireland.  The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, public procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p><p>There are a range of supports available from the LEOs to assist start-ups.  The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  These include feasibility grants (investigating the potential of a business idea) and priming grants (to part-fund a start-up).  In 2017, almost &euro;6.5 million in priming grants was approved for 294 new LEO clients across the country.  It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses).</p><p>The LEOs attracted 1,471 applicants to the recent Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition.  IBYE is a programme run by the 31 LEOs with the support of my Department and Enterprise Ireland and is aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship as a career choice among young people.  The competition is open to people between the ages of 18 and 35 with an innovative business idea and has an investment fund of up to &euro;2 million.</p><p>The LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; supports in the form of training, such as a Start Your Own Business (SYOB) course, or assign a mentor to work with the business proposer.  Over 3,700 participants attended SYOB courses run by the LEOs in 2017.</p><p>The Student Enterprise Programme (SEP), which is run by the LEOs, is the biggest enterprise competition for students in Ireland.  It helps students to grasp real life skills associated with running a real enterprise including working as part of a team, managing production and finances, organising a sales and marketing campaign and liaising directly with customers, judges and the media.  Over 22,000 second level students participate on the Programme each year.</p><p>The LEOs also run promotional events such as the National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Local Enterprise Week, which are aimed at, <i>inter alia</i>, promoting the LEO services and encouraging people to start or grow a business.  These events are supplemented by LEO participation in other promotional events such as the National Ploughing Championship.</p><p>Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEOs to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.</p><p>A range of supports have been developed to assist LEO clients facing the challenges posed by Brexit, but many of these are beneficial for all micro and small enterprises, particularly those who are seeking to grow their business or explore new markets.  These supports include: </p><p>- Information events around the country for core and non-core clients.  The objective of these sessions is to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit, and to engage in a process of strategic planning to ensure their companies have a robust strategy in place. </p><p>- The information sessions are supplemented by an online Brexit SME Scorecard that LEO clients can complete to self-assess their readiness for Brexit.  The Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit.</p><p>- A key element of the range of LEO Brexit responses is a Lean4Micro programme, which was designed to encourage clients to adopt Lean business principles in their organisation to increase performance and competitiveness.  This programme is relevant to all micro and small businesses.</p><p>- Along with the core LEO priming and business development grants, the LEOs are now offering a Technical Assistance for Micro-exporters (TAME) grant, which is designed to help LEO clients to find new markets and exports by part-funding expenditure incurred investigating and researching export markets, e.g. exhibiting at Trade Fairs, preparing marketing material and developing websites specifically targeting export markets.</p><p>- The Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVs) is a grant scheme designed to assist micro businesses to establish or enhance their online presence, which can also aid the Brexit transition.  It offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 along with training, advice and mentoring to help businesses trade online. </p><p>- The LEO Mentor Programme is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owners/managers who need practical and strategic one-to-one advice and guidance.  Tailored mentoring is being rolled out to address Brexit-related business challenges.  The LEOs also share the Enterprise Ireland Mentor platform for their clients, which provides expertise regarding export matters, including in relation to export finance.</p><p>- The LEO Innovation and Investment Fund (LIIF) programme is a new scheme to support innovation in micro-enterprises and get them investor ready to scale their businesses.  Successful applicants will undertake an intensive investor ready development programme, which includes one to one mentoring, focused on developing a robust business plan.  Upon completion of the programme, the applicants pitch to a panel of LEO, EI and private sector representatives for grant investment which will go towards the execution of their investor ready business plan.  </p></reply>

The clinical advice from the HSE and the Department of Health is clear that there is no evidence that the clinical and technical aspects of CervicalCheck have performed outside or below international standards or the quality guidelines set for the programme.  However, where a woman has concerns, she can if necessary have a smear test with her GP. CervicalCheck will reimburse the GP for the consultation and any smear test and no charge will arise for the patient.  Women who have recently completed with the programme and are now somewhat above the age range, but who are concerned, will not be excluded from these arrangements.</p></reply>

Saolta, in association with the National Clinical Programme for Health and Wellbeing, commenced the 'Cro&iacute; Clann' programme in January 2017 and funding of &euro;200,000 per year for a 3 year period will support 400 places on the Cro&iacute; Clann programme per year.  The &lsquo;Cro&iacute; Clann&rsquo; programme adopts a holistic, multi-disciplinary approach, focusing on weight management as part of a comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction strategy. </p><p>In addition, Galway University Hospital provide the 'Milk-based Intensive Lifestyle Intervention' programme (MILIS programme), which is an intensive meal-replacement programme involving 14 visits over six months to the bariatric outpatients department for patients with severe complications of obesity.  Currently there are 244 patients on the waiting list for this programme, with the longest waiting on the list since April 2016. </p><p>The HSE advise that funding of &euro;110,000 was allocated to Galway University Hospital in 2016 and 22 bariatric surgeries were undertaken.  </p><p>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improve waiting times for patients, the Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan was launched last month.

For very long waiting patients, the Action Plan sets a target that the NTPF will provide 1,200 procedures in 2018.  This could include those waiting for bariatric surgery.  As outlined in the Plan, the NTPF will do this by inviting public hospitals to seek solutions for very long waiters either in the private sector or through insourcing.

It was asked to produce a series of action-focused recommendations. The Taskforce report was published in December. The report made recommendations on 10 different themed areas. It also identified lead agencies associated with each recommendation that would be tasked with developing and/or implementing these as appropriate. </p>  <p>  Since publication of the Taskforce report, a number of the recommendations have been incorporated into the service plans of lead agencies for 2018. The implementation of these recommendations will be achieved on an on-going basis over the course of this year. A small number of recommendations require evaluation and it is anticipated that all recommendations will be implemented within a three years following publication of the Youth Mental Health Task Force report. Related to this, approval is currently being sought from DPER to establish a new inter-departmental team called Pathfinder. Part of the remit of the Pathfinder team will be the continued prioritisation and implementation of outstanding Taskforce recommendations. It is hoped that the Pathfinder team will be established in 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have specifically set as a priority the development of a mental health telephone line, signposting tool and digital on-line supports for those accessing information about mental health. These priorities relate to actions two and three of the YMH Task Force. A final date for roll-out of this service is yet to be determined, but significant work is on-going.</p></reply>

The Medical Council collects and analyses data from the general, specialist and trainee specialist registers to produce valuable data on the GP workforce. The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service collects data on the number of GMS contract-holders and those GPs delivering state-funded primary care services. The Irish College of General Practitioners also collects and analyses data on the GP workforce, including the number of doctors registered for professional competence and those holding membership of the ICGP.</p>  <p>The number of doctors on the Medical Council&rsquo;s Specialist Register in General Practice has increased from 2,270 in 2010 to 3,668 as at 18  May 2018. Holding registration does not, however, necessarily mean that a medical practitioner is active in general practice at the time. </p>  <p>  Doctors on the Medical Council&rsquo;s General Register may practice independently without supervision but may not falsely represent themselves as holding specialist or trainee specialist registration. There are currently 9,805 doctors registered on the General Register of the Medical Council. All doctors registered with the Medical Council must maintain professional competence by enrolling in a professional competence scheme and maintain professional competence activities that are relevant to their practice. </p>  <p>  In the last ten years, the number of GPs contracted by the HSE to provide services to medical card holders and GP visit card holders under the GMS scheme has increased. At the end of 2008 there were 2,098 GPs who held GMS contracts. As of 1 May 2018, 2,491 GPs hold GMS contracts. Many GPs also hold contracts with the HSE to provide services under other state schemes, e.g. the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme. There are a further 420 GPs without GMS contracts who hold other such contracts with the HSE, bringing the total number of GPs contracted by the HSE at present to 2,911. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012, it became mandatory for a GP to be on the Medical Council&rsquo;s Specialist Register in the specialty of General Practice in order to obtain a GMS contract. However, there would be a number of GMS contract holders who are not on the Specialist Register who would have obtained their GMS contract prior to this legislation being enacted.</p>  <p>  The number of doctors who provide general practitioner services to patients exclusively on a private basis is not collected by my Department or HSE.</p></reply>

Under the Misuse of Drugs legislation products containing THC are strictly controlled and possession is unlawful except under licence.</p><p>- CBD is derived from cannabis. However, since it is not psychoactive it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation, and does not require a Ministerial Licence. </p><p><b>Access to Medical Cannabis via the Ministerial Licence Route</b></p><p>- Currently medical practitioners who wish to prescribe cannabis products containing THC may apply to the Minister for Health, for a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</p><p>- The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the granting of such a licence must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.</p><p><b>How to apply for a Ministerial licence</b></p><p>A medical cannabis licence application submitted to the Minister for Health, in line with the Misuse of Drugs Acts, must include: </p><p>- An outline of the treatment the patient has received to date and justification from the doctor as to why it is appropriate in their patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances to prescribe cannabis.</p><p>- Details of the cannabis product which it is proposed to prescribe and administer to the patient.</p><p>- The source of the cannabis product.</p><p>- The arrangements for the ongoing monitoring and care of the patient once the cannabis-based treatment has commenced. </p><p>The application must be submitted either by the patient&rsquo;s medical consultant, or by their General Practitioner (GP).  Applications from the patient's GP must include written endorsement for the proposed cannabis treatment for the individual patient by the patient's consultant.</p><p>The decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment, including cannabis treatment, for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. The Minister for Health has no role in this clinical decision-making process.</p><p>Consultants or GPs requiring further information or clarification in relation to the licence application process are advised to contact the Department of Health directly. Valid applications received are assessed without delay.</p><p>A patient who is eligible under the Long Term Illness Scheme has automatic access to all of the products on the core list of products for that condition. This list is published on the HSE website. Medical cannabis is not listed as one of the approved products currently. Where a patient seeks reimbursement of a product outside the core list, there is an individual reimbursement application process. </p><p>The patient's treating clinician should complete the individual reimbursement request application form and return it to the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS). Where such an application is approved, the HSE will then determine how the patient may be assisted, where they hold a Ministerial License.</p></reply>

Regional  co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services.</p>  <p>   The Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE), and the Department of Education and Skills, continue to work together to provide a wide range of services and supports for those who have received a diagnosis of narcolepsy following administration of the pandemic influenza vaccine.  These include discretionary medical cards, reimbursement of expenses associated with diagnosis and treatment, home tuition and learning supports. </p>  <p>  The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis.   </p>  <p>  Work has commenced on the Centre of Excellence for Narcolepsy based in St James's Hospital which will cater for all people diagnosed with narcolepsy, including those diagnosed with narcolepsy after receiving pandemic influenza vaccine.  This service will combine a new patient referral system with access to expert consultant and advanced nursing expertise for clinical diagnosis, access to the latest neurophysiological diagnostic techniques with overnight and daytime monitoring for both in-patients and outpatients, laboratory testing, brain imaging and genetic testing.  The HSE will continue to pay for access to the services, such as dietician and psychology services, that would have been provided in the Centre of Excellence from private providers to so that none of the affected individuals miss out on receiving these supports.</p></reply>

However, for a specified episode of in-patient services, where a person does not avail of, or waives his/her right to public in-patient services, but instead avails of private in-patient services for example private consultant services, he/she shall not have eligibility for public in-patient services for that episode of in-patient care. </p>  <p>  Where a patient has opted to be treated as a private patient in a public hospital, and has advised the hospital's Admissions staff that he/she has private health insurance, the patient will be asked to sign the relevant private health insurer Hospital Claim Form and a Private Insurance Patient form.  This ensures that all charges related to the provision of private in-patient services for that episode of care are submitted to the patient's private health insurer for payment.  When choosing to be treated privately, it is important that persons are satisfied as to their level of insurance cover. </p>  <p>  Patients opting to be treated privately have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital in respect of the services that each provides.  Under the Health Act 1970 (as amended), the HSE is required to levy statutory private in-charges on all patients opting to receive private in-patient services.  There is no provision in the legislation to waive these charges.</p></reply>

The scope of the remediation was later extended by Government to include ground level remediation of the former steelworks factory site including the area of the island known as the South Tip. The Government approved a total ring-fenced budget of &euro;61m for all costs associated with remediation of Haulbowline Island.</p>  <p>  Funding for the remediation of the Haulbowline Island is ring-fenced in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for this specific purpose and the remit of my Department relates only to the remediation of the island.  </p>  <p>  Cork County Council is appointed as my agent for the operational delivery of the remediation project.  Cork County Council has a project office commissioned for managing the Haulbowline Island Remediation Project, which includes the East Tip, South Tip and steelworks sites. </p>  <p>  My Department assumed responsibility for remediation works at Haulbowline Island in 2012. In the period up to 2017 expenditure was focussed on preparing for and securing the necessary planning and waste licence consents and upgrading the island infrastructure (bridge and access road) in anticipation of works.  The funding is being provided through my Department&rsquo;s vote, in accordance with the specific conditions set out by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, on an annual basis up to the completion date of the remediation works.  The total expenditure incurred by the Department (including expenditure commissioned by Cork County Council acting as agents for the project and reimbursed through the Department) to the end of 2017 is just over &euro;13m.  </p>  <p>  The Revised Estimates for Public Services allocates &euro;10m to the project for 2018.  The expenditure incurred in 2018 will be influenced by the nature of risks which may arise in remediation works on a site with a legacy as complex as Haulbowline Island.  While the works and contractual arrangements have been designed to achieve cost-effective remediation, it is not possible at this point to be definitive about the final costs.  The works being carried out on site include marine elements to prevent tidal incursions to the site, access and infrastructure works and capping the waste materials to render the site safe, stable and suitable for future uses.  To date, I am advised that works are progressing well on the East Tip and are expected to be concluded in December 2018.</p></reply>

This competitive grant aid scheme supports capital investments in specialised horticultural equipment and buildings that contribute to at least one of the scheme&rsquo;s four objectives namely to: improve the quality of output, facilitate environmentally friendly practices, improve working conditions and promote diversification of production. The grant aid covers all areas of the horticultural industry; field vegetables, mushrooms, protected crops, nursery crops, soft fruit/apples, cut foliage, Christmas trees, bulbs and bee-keeping.</p>  <p>  The re-opening of this scheme was targeted towards the soft fruit and amenity plant sectors in particular and approvals will be limited to growers that are proposing investments in response to damage caused by Storm Emma. This targeted measure gives these growers a window of opportunity to apply for grant aid to assist their business to recover from the effects of the storm. </p>  <p>  The closing date for applications under the targeted re-opening of the Scheme was Friday 27 April.  A total 12 applications were received by the closing date and approvals will issue shortly to successful applicants. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the challenge for those that do not plan to rebuild, the priority following the storm was to restore the means of production. Accordingly, grant aid was made available only for works associated with construction or investment in replacement equipment. This has been provided for through the re-opening of the 2018 Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector and there are no plans to facilitate a compensation scheme to facilitate the removal of broken glass.</p></reply>

The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) provides farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over the next six years. I will continue to support fully this programme through the lifetime of the current( RDP) Rural Development Programme.  </p>  <p>  In 2017 the BDGP was reopened to beef suckler farmers who were not already part of the scheme. We have 24,775 participants between BDGP I and II. BDGP II provides for payments to farmers for completion of actions which deliver accelerated genetic improvement in the national herd and improvement of its environmental sustainability. A total of 42.8 million has been paid to participants for 2017 already. </p>  <p>  The BDGP was agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (2014-2020) alongside a number of other schemes such as ANCs, GLAS and TAMS, which also benefit suckler farmers. I am very conscious of the positive effect that the programme is having on the Irish suckler herd. It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the national herd. </p>  <p>  I agree that in our deliberations on CAP reform post-2020, encouraging generational renewal should be a priority.  The current CAP, which was agreed during the Irish Presidency in 2013, allowed for supplementary payments from the National Reserve for young trained farmers and for their prioritisation in the assessment of applications under the Rural Development Programme. In addition, a range of agri-taxation measures are in place to support land mobility, inter-generational transfer and farm partnerships.</p></reply>

IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers (including river sections and estuaries) has its own genetically unique stock of salmon.</p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by the independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC), comprising scientists from a range of organisations.  Scientific and management assessments of each of the distinct stocks are carried out every year with IFI engaged in extensive stock monitoring which feeds into the SSC's annual reviews. The SSC uses catch returns of individual rivers (rod catch, catch and release and any commercial catch) over the previous five years to estimate the total salmon returns in each of the previous five years.  The use of a five year average ensures that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the stock assessment in any single year.</p>  <p>  Each river has an individual conservation limit which is the number of adult salmon required to maintain a healthy population.  Rivers which sufficiently exceed their conservation limit may be opened for harvest fisheries (recreational and/or commercial). Rivers which meet 50% of their conservation limit may be opened for catch and release (C&amp;R) angling which permits enjoyment of angling while having a negligible impact of vulnerable fish stocks and encouraging the shared responsibility to contribute to conservation and the potential rebuilding of these stocks.  For 2018, 78 rivers in Ireland were open to harvest or catch and release fishing. </p>  <p>  The decline in wild Atlantic Salmon is an international issue manifesting in rivers in all countries around the North Atlantic with scientific analysis from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) estimating that marine survival of migrating salmon has been at or below 5% in the North Atlantic for more than a decade. </p>  <p>  Marine survival is considered to have the biggest influence on return, from far North Atlantic feeding grounds, of salmon to all rivers on Atlantic coasts.  Climate change in the ocean is considered to be a major factor.  There is also evidence that heavy sea-lice infestation from salmon farming has resulted in additional mortality in respect of migratory North Atlantic salmon generally.  In freshwater, water quality and a range of pressures such as afforestation, drainage, effluent discharge, siltation and agricultural enrichment can all have an impact on juvenile salmon production.</p>  <p>  The protection and conservation of salmon internationally is managed through the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with which Ireland is aligned through the European Union. Concerted international co-operation has ensured that restrictions in feeding ground in Greenland and Faroese waters have been in place for a number of years via NASCO agreement. In June this year, my officials and those of IFI will join delegates from the EU, USA, Canada, Norway, the Russian Federation, Greenland and the Faroes in seeking to negotiate a continuation of restrictions in these waters. </p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies. In order to align fully with the Directive and the NASCO principles, Ireland closed mixed stock fisheries at sea since 2007. It is considered that river stocks in Ireland would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented.</p></reply>

The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure.</p><p>It is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or a weight related fee. </p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced. Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. </p><p>The Price Monitoring Group has considered eight months of data to date. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability. The Price Monitoring Group has reported that there are currently 9 different types of price models on the market. The main price examples include a service charge plus charge per bin lift, with an excess per kg charge, and a service charge plus per kg weight charge. The most popular service offering now is the &lsquo;service charge including weight allowance, plus per kg charge for excess above allowance&rsquo;. </p><p>An annual support of &euro;75 per person is being made available for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence.

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP).</p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017.</p><p>There are 11 premises in the townland of Back of the Hill, Longford. 6 (55%) falling within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention. 5 (45%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment. In the absence of specific eircodes for the three homes in question, it cannot be discerned which category these  premises are in.</p><p>However, Information regarding premises categories can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, by entering the relevant eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at . A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i></p><p>A county by county breakdown of eir&rsquo;s data for Q1 2018 will be available shortly on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>With regard to the matter of cabling raised by the Deputy, if these premises are in a LIGHT BLUE area, I have to advise that decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the rollout and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis by competing service providers operating in a liberalised market. I have no statutory role or function to intervene in the commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services.</p><p>I recognise the importance of availability of high speed connectivity for all premises in Ireland and fully appreciate the frustration for communities and businesses that do not currently have access to this level of connectivity.  Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises (including the six in the townland of Back of the Hill) that fall within the State led intervention area under the NBP remains a priority for me and this Government. </p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

There have been no further meetings with the company since then.</p>  <p>  The use of these devices highlighted a number of regulatory shortcomings in EU legislation, most notably that the current emissions test cycle in the EU is not representative of actual &ldquo;on road&rdquo; real driving conditions.  To address these issues the EU introduced revisions to the test cycle to be more representative of emissions from the real-world driving experience (RDE). Ireland fully supports this approach and its early implementation.  From 1 September 2017, the new RDE tests are compulsory to determine whether a new car model is allowed to be placed on the market.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s interest in this matter relates primarily to the levels of NOx emitted from the transport sector, and I do not have policy responsibility for the specification or roadworthiness of any vehicles.  The EU position in this area is managed by the Technical Committee - Motor Vehicles.  The Road Safety Authority, which is under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is the agency that attends the committee's meetings on behalf of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Consumer protection issues are ultimately a matter for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.

The telecommunications market in Ireland is regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, Comreg.</p><p>I have no statutory role or function to oversee the commercial decisions of private operators.</p><p>That notwithstanding, my Department monitors eir&rsquo;s ongoing deployment of high speed broadband to rural areas under the terms of the Commitment Agreement signed between myself and the company in April 2017, a copy of which is available on my Department's website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>In accordance with the Commitment Agreement eir has committed to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at . eir&rsquo;s deployment milestone progress is also published on my Department&rsquo;s website on a quarterly basis.</p><p>In compliance with the obligations of the Commitment Agreement, officials from my Department meet with eir on a monthly basis to review the company&rsquo;s performance on certain sub-milestones. The purpose of these review meetings is for eir to report progress against sub-milestone tasks and also to identify any deployment related risks or issues and associated risk mitigation plans. These sub-milestones cover the tasks that are required to deliver high speed broadband to premises within the Planned Rural Deployment area. A detailed definition of each sub-milestone is provided in the Commitment Agreement.</p><p>Data for Q1 2018 recently submitted by eir to my Department indicates that the company has passed some 145,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. Eir has signalled that there would be likely knock-on effects to the 2018 milestone targets due to the severe weather impacts of both storms Ophelia and Emma. </p><p>A county by county breakdown of eir&rsquo;s data for Q1 2018 will be available shortly on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the development and implementation of public transport and sustainable transport infrastructure including the Leap Card Scheme.</p>  <p>  The NTA recently marked the sale of the 3 millionth Leap Card.  The card is a convenient way for passengers to pay for public transport services in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford.  The NTA reports that of the 3 million cards issued to date, close to 250,000 have been sold in the first four months of 2018 alone.  Since the sale of the first edition over 6 years ago, the Leap Card has enabled 495 million journeys &ndash; 63.5 million of which took place from January to April 2018.  The card has emerged as the preferred payment for passengers in many Irish cities, with consumers using it to save 20% on their public transport journeys.  In the Greater Dublin Area, some 70% of public transport journeys are now paid using Leap.  Overall the scheme has reached monthly turnover of &euro;23.3 million per month (April 2018) - or over &euro;633 million since its launch. </p>  <p>  The NTA has been gradually extending the applicability of the Leap card system and will continue to do so and to respond positively to customer feedback, so that new innovations are integrated into the scheme.  The NTA wishes to ensure that Leap continues to grow as the safe payment method of choice for consumer who are increasingly moving to public transport modes. </p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.  I ask him to advise my private office if he does not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

We issues licences to people on the basis that they have been tested to defined standards.  These standards are set at EU level.  On these grounds, all EU driving licences are interchangeable.</p><p>In the case of non-EU jurisdictions, Member States may reach bilateral agreements on the exchange of driving licences.  These agreements are reached only when detailed study of the two licensing regimes has taken place and both sides are satisfied that the standards of the two systems are comparable.</p><p>On this basis, Ireland has reached agreements with Australia and New Zealand.  However, the agreement with Australia covers truck licences, among others, while that with New Zealand is restricted to cars and motorbikes.  These distinctions are based on considerations of public safety based on the differing standards applied in the different jurisdictions.</p><p>It is not correct that it would be possible for the individual in this case to exchange his New Zealand truck licence for a French equivalent and then exchange that for the Irish equivalent.  Bilateral arrangements of this type apply only to the Member States which make them.  This matter has been tested and ruled on very clearly by the European Court of Justice.  In the case suggested, a French truck licence given in exchange for a New Zealand truck licence could not be exchanged for an Irish truck licence, because the person originally qualified for a New Zealand truck licence, which Ireland does not accept for exchange.</p></reply>

The plan should identify the young person's needs, including accommodation.  The vast majority of young people leaving care have been living in foster care, and many remain there while completing their second level education and commencing further education or training. </p><p>At the end of 2017, 2,037 young people over the age of 18 were in receipt of aftercare services.  Of these, 5% were in a residential placement.  If a young adult needs residential care when they reach 18 for reasons related to disability, they transfer to the care of the HSE.</p><p>Performance indicators for aftercare services are in the process of being developed and so the specific information requested by the Deputy is currently not collated nationally.</p></reply>

A particular objective of the scheme is to target the towns and villages that were badly hit by the recent recession and might benefit most from the scheme.  In that context, I do not believe that increasing the limits in respect of the number of applications submitted by county, or adopting a per capita basis per county, will necessarily achieve that aim.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Town and Village Renewal scheme was launched in the second half of 2016 and it is being enhanced and adapted on an ongoing basis with the aim of ensuring the revitalization of towns and villages across the country.</p>  <p>  Under the 2016 scheme, each county received an allocation of &euro;380,000 and each Local Authority was invited to submit up to 8 projects for approval by my Department.</p>  <p>  In 2017, a competitive process was introduced, with a strong emphasis on measures that would have a strong economic impact on towns and villages.  Each Local Authority was invited to submit a maximum of 15 applications for consideration by my Department.  All applications were assessed against the scheme criteria and successful applications were selected on the basis of merit.</p>  <p>  Under the 2018 scheme which I announced recently, each Local Authority has been invited to submit a maximum of 12 projects for consideration.  While the selection of applications will again be based on merit, as outlined in the scheme documentation my Department will endeavour to select at least 4 projects in each county, depending on the quality of the proposals received, in order to ensure a reasonable geographic spread.  The 2018 scheme is again encouraging applications in respect of projects that can bring a positive economic impact to towns and villages and I am hoping to approve a higher number of large-scale projects that meet this objective.  It is for this reason that I have asked Local Authorities to submit a slightly lower number of proposals than in 2017.</p>  <p>  Over 450 projects have been funded across the country under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme since it was introduced in the second half of 2016.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting rural Ireland is underscored through Project Ireland 2040, which will see the creation of a new &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund to be launched shortly.  This new Fund will provide an opportunity to deliver more integrated and ambitious projects which will further support the revitalisation of our rural towns and villages.</p></reply>

The eligibility criteria for the scheme are largely based on the Memorandum governing the scheme which was published in 2002 by the then Department of Environment and Local Government.  The scheme is currently delivered through the Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  Eligible roads are non-public roads, often leading to houses and important community amenities such as graveyards, beaches, piers, mountains, etc., or other non-public roads that provide access to parcels of land, or provide access for harvesting purposes (including turf or seaweed) for two or more persons.  There must be more than one landholder on an LIS road and the road must be open to the public.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the relevant Local Authority to select and prioritise the road projects that will receive LIS funding, including on offshore islands, in line with the scheme criteria, their financial allocation, and the Memorandum governing the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum does not preclude roads on islands being selected by the relevant Local Authorities.

Neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme.  Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in relation to that scheme.</p>  <p>  Almost all Irish defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.</p>  <p>  However, in the case where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, the employer and the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify scheme members, beneficiaries and the authorised trade unions.  Furthermore, changes made to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) Regulations in 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published recently, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.</p>  <p>  The general scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions can be stopped.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the Minimum Funding Standard.</p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June.  With the cooperation of the Oireachtas, the Government intends to pass this legislation before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseekers benefit.</p>  <p>  The BTWEA is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years &ndash; 100% in year one and 75% in year two.</p>  <p>  At the end of April, there were 8,856 recipients of Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, and 348 recipients of Short-Term Enterprise Allowance.</p>  <p>  As well as these supports, at the end of April there were 7,278 people in receipt of a Jobseeker payment (Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance) who indicated that they were previously self-employed.</p>  <p>  Because &lsquo;self-employment&rsquo; status or previous status is not relevant for entitlement to many other social welfare benefits, there is no &lsquo;self-employed&rsquo; category for other benefits.</p></reply>

The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  The package is currently paid to over 436,000 customers and will cost an estimated &euro;237 million in 2018.  An applicant would only have to satisfy a means test for HHB if they are aged between 66 and 70 years and not<i></i>receiving a social welfare type pension.  Therefore an increase in the rate of primary social welfare payments would have no detrimental effect on this cohort of people. </p><p>The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;22.50 per week from October to April, to over 338,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;227 million in 2018.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  A person applying for a fuel allowance must satisfy a means test.  All qualifying non-contributory recipients are accepted as satisfying the means-test.  Where a person on a contributory payment resides with household members in receipt of non-contributory payments, income from the non-contributory payments is disregarded for the purpose of calculating entitlement to Fuel Allowance.</p><p>The current income limit for fuel allowance is set at &euro;100.00 a week above the appropriate maximum State Pension (Contributory) rate.  The following assessable income limits therefore apply from 30 March 2018 when the rate of State Pension (Contributory) increased:</p><blockquote>(i) &euro;343.30 for a single person under 80 years (&euro;100 plus &euro;243.30), up from &euro;338.30 <br /><br />(ii) &euro;505.40 for a couple, where the qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant is under 66 years (&euro;100 plus &euro;243.30 plus &euro;162.10), up from &euro;497.10<br /><br />(iii) &euro;561.30 for a couple, where the qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant is 66 years or over (&euro;100 plus &euro;243.30 plus &euro;218.00); up from &euro;551.80</blockquote><p>Therefore the income limits for HHB and fuel allowance automatically increase when the rates of State Pension (Contributory) increase.  Accordingly it is not necessary for my Department to conduct an analysis of the impact increasing primary social welfare payments has on income thresholds for entitlement to HHB or fuel allowance payment. </p><p>Additionally, my Department would not have any figures on the number of people who lost entitlement to HHB or fuel allowance because of an increase in primary social welfare payments as the income threshold is automatically adjusted.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.</p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme. Crucially, unlike the existing Homemakers disregard system, periods of home-caring before that scheme was introduced in 1994 may be recognised under the new scheme.</p>  <p>  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period.</p>  <p>  The new TCA for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, comes into effect from 30 March 2018. Pensioners do not need to contact the Department at this juncture. Instead, the Department will invite over 40,000 pensioners, who were assessed under the current rate bands in place since 2012, to have their pensions recalculated under TCA to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.</p>  <p>  Legislation is currently being prepared to enact these changes. Following the passing of this legislation, the Department expects to send out these invitations from Quarter 4 of 2018 and to begin payments, including arrears for any period from 30 March 2018, from Quarter 1 of 2019.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant did when it was in place.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.</p>  <p>  In 2017, some 2,800 ENPs were awarded to assist with funerals and burial expenses at a cost of &euro;5.1 million.</p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The project was submitted for funding by Fingal County Council, following a Call for Proposals in August 2016.  The proposal was assessed by the LIHAF Advisory Group and LIHAF Management Committee and was recommended for approval.  It received preliminary approval in March 2017 and a grant agreement was signed in October 2017. The overall cost of the project is &euro;14.16 million, of which &euro;10.62 million is being funded by the Exchequer, with Fingal County Council funding the remaining &euro;3.54 million.  The project is being managed by Fingal County Council and my Department reviews its progress on a regular basis, in line with the terms of the grant agreement. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Donabate Distributor Road was granted planning permission by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in July 2011 and the approved scheme comprises approximately 3km of dual-carriageway and 1km of single-carriageway road.  At present, the scheme is being constructed as a single-carriageway road along its entire length, as this configuration is forecast to be sufficient to accommodate traffic flows in advance of the various developments taking place in and around Donabate.  Construction is being undertaken, however, to include provision for upgrade to dual-carriageway standard in due course, in line with the scheme planning permission. Accordingly, underground utilities, drainage infrastructure, surface water attenuation ponds, junction alignments, bridge structures and land acquisition are all being implemented at present to accommodate dual-carriageway standard road, thereby minimising the level of works required in the future when the upgrade works are required. </p>  <p>  This phasing is in line with the provisions of the Donabate Local Area Plan 2016, as adopted by Fingal County Council, and also with the Council&rsquo;s LIHAF application.</p>  <p>  The main contract for the construction of this scheme was tendered on eTenders in 2017 and a main contractor was subsequently appointed by Fingal County Council in line with public procurement requirements. Various water services upgrades were included in the original contract documents. Additional requirements have arisen, in consultation with Irish Water, in the intervening period as the scheme design was further developed and these measures are now being executed through the contract.  Fingal County Council have advised that any changes to the contract in this regard are being implemented in line with public procurement requirements.</p></reply>

When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 16.7% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 15.2% above the relevant rent limits. In the Galway City Council area, at the end of Q4, 2017, 51% of households had benefited from additional discretion with the average rate being 15% above the applicable rent limits.

I have no plans at present to increase HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas, a course of action which could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector and thereby have a potentially detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.   </p></reply>

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP.  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter than the statutory maximum in many areas.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector. My Department does not hold details on the processing times for HAP applications or payments.  The earliest date a HAP payment will issue to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities. This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  More than 36,150 households are currently in receipt of HAP support. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. </p><p>Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 are targeted to be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources, including 3,500 homes targeted using the Repair and Lease Scheme (RLS), and 6,500 homes using a  combination of the existing social housing leasing arrangements, and the new Enhanced Leasing Scheme. All homes delivered under leasing arrangements will be funded under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  It is intended that up to 2,000 units will be leased by Local Authorities in 2018 through the range of leasing schemes in place.</p><p>The new Enhanced Leasing Scheme has been developed by my Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), the Housing Agency and local authorities, in order to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives. The Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available.  There are, however, a number of key differences between the existing long term lease and the enhanced lease, the purpose of which is to facilitate larger levels of private investment in social housing while ensuring that the capital investment is off balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure. </p><p>The scheme will be governed by my Department and operated by local authorities. The Housing Agency will manage and administer the scheme on behalf of my Department and will act as a national co-ordinator.</p><p>A call for proposals was launched on 31 January 2018 and the Housing Agency accepted submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018. All proposals are subject to a range of criteria as set out in the &ldquo;Calls for Proposals for Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme&rdquo; and the proposals will be assessed and marked in accordance with the terms set out therein. This document sets out the various assessment stages and the expected minimum associated timeframes (Appendix 4). The Call for Proposals is available on the Housing Agency website at the following link: .</p><p>A total of 33 submissions were received from interested parties which represents strong interest from the market. The Housing Agency is currently reviewing the proposals and will complete the initial review process (Stage 1) in the coming weeks. The total number of units proposed is still being worked through as part of the assessment process and will be the subject of an agreement between the individual Local Authorities and proposers. </p><p>Further information with respect to the numbers and locations of the units proposed for leasing under the Scheme will be available when the individual proposals have been assessed, marked and accepted in accordance with the terms and methodology set out in the Calls for Proposals document.</p></reply>

Other PPP programmes, such as those designed to deliver schools or medical facilities, would be the responsibility of the Ministers for Education and Skills, and Health, respectively, while more general policy on PPPs is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The first bundle in the social housing PPP programme, comprising a total of six PPP sites, will provide over 500 homes in the Greater Dublin Area. Two of the sites are located in the Dublin City Council area with one each in the County Council areas of South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth. The second bundle, comprising eight PPP sites, will provide over 450 new homes. Three of the sites are located in County Cork, with one in each in the cities of Galway and Waterford, and in the counties of Clare, Kildare and Roscommon. The identification and selection of sites for the third project bundle is at a preliminary stage.</p>  <p>  The social housing being developed at all these sites is in co-operation with the relevant local authorities. It is expected that construction on the first bundle of sites will commence later this year, with homes becoming available towards the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  Each of these bundles has a capital value in the region on &euro;100 million. Bundling a number of sites together from across the country generates economies of scale, which ultimately results in improved value for money for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  As part of each PPP bundle, Enterprise Ireland organise a "Meet the Buyer" event during the preferred tenderer stage. This event gives an opportunity for smaller contractors to meet with the consortia that are bidding for the tender. This engagement gives local SMEs from across the country, and from the local areas where the housing units are to be built, an opportunity to become involved in working on individual elements of these broader projects, including both the construction phase as well as the 25-year management and maintenance phase. The "Meet the Buyer" event for the first bundle of housing sites was held in the Mansion House in Dublin on 14 March 2018, and it was well attended by a range of relevant companies.</p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that the proportion of social housing homes being built using this availability-based PPP model, as compared to traditional means, is very low. The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan has set a target of delivering 50,000 social housing homes during its lifetime. At present, the 1,500 social housing homes under the PPP programme are the only social housing units that my Department plans to fund using this method, and none of these units are located in Donegal.</p></reply>

Development plans are generally drafted and adopted in accordance with national policies and objectives, as well as statutory planning guidelines which are current at the time of their adoption.</p>  <p>  However, there can be instances where new Government policies and objectives are adopted after the adoption of a development plan, thereby superseding specific local policies in the development plan, and which consequently the Board is required to have regard to in the determination of planning appeals or applications before it. This can result in the Board attaching greater significance to new and updated Government policy than to a development plan objective that may have been adopted a number of years ago, thereby resulting in the contravening of the development plan by the Board in making its determination on a planning appeal or application.</p></reply>

The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders. My Department understands from the NSAI that the Technical Committee is in the process of finalising the standardised protocol, which will be available for public consultation in the coming weeks and will run for a period of six weeks. </p><p>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference.  Engineers Ireland have provided assurance that they will collaborate with the Department, the NSAI and others on measures to establish such a register once the standardised protocol is in place.</p><p>Last year I visited Donegal and Mayo and met with key stakeholders, including affected homeowners, elected members and officials of the local authorities and other interested parties. On 18 December 2017, I again visited Donegal and met with key stakeholders to provide an update on the progress to date. I made a similar visit to Mayo on 26 January 2018. </p><p>I would be pleased to accept the invitation to visit Donegal again, once the standardised protocol is in place, in order to provide a further update on progress at that time.</p><p>In addition, and in light of the information contained in the report, I am currently considering what further actions may be required to assist the parties directly involved in reaching a satisfactory resolution to the problems that have emerged in the two counties. </p></reply>

An official from the Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service visited the site last Friday evening to assess the situation.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the masonry grotto structure which was built around the well in the 1940s has been removed by recent work. The well is not a recorded monument or protected structure. I am advised that the well itself remains extant as do two carved stone heads of potential medieval date: these stone heads are a recorded monument. </p>  <p>  The National Monuments Act 1994 requires anyone carrying out works at or in relation to a recorded monument to give the Minister two months&rsquo; advance notice of the works. In addition to meeting requirements under the National Monuments Acts, any development must also be carried out in accordance with applicable planning and development legislation, for which the relevant planning authority has specific statutory responsibility.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining the question of compliance with the statutory two months notice requirement referred to above, along with the report on last week&rsquo;s site visit and will be following up on the matter as a priority.</p>  <p>  Access to archaeological sites and monuments which are situated on private property is a matter for the landowners.</p></reply>

The SLA was signed in December 2015 when the estimated cost of the project was &euro;50 million.  Since then, the project cost has increased and while the full cost has not yet been agreed, it is likely to exceed of &euro;70 million.  Aligned with the increase in the project cost is a request from the City Council for additional Exchequer funding of &euro;10m. This is being considered at present. Any revised funding agreement would require a revised SLA.</p>  <p>  Under the existing SLA, my Department is to provide funding of &euro;12 million to the project subject to the Council complying with the terms and conditions which include the registration of a charge on the facility, the production of documentary evidence that all funding is in place to bring the Event Centre into public use, tax clearance certification and the provision of information on the Centre for a period of ten years from the payment of the grant, as well as payment procedures.  The SLA covered a period of four years.</p></reply>

In that context, a four year contract worth &euro;1.2m was awarded under the Online Irish Language Newspaper Scheme to Tuairisc.ie for the provision of a free online weekly newspaper. In addition to this, a three year contract valued at &euro;254,814 was awarded under the Irish Language Lifestyle Magazine Scheme to N&Oacute;S for the provision of a free online monthly lifestyle magazine, while a three year contract worth &euro;360,000 was awarded under the Irish Magazine Scheme to Comhar to provide a free online literary and current affairs publication.</p>  <p>  It is clear that reading habits have changed dramatically in recent years. The continuing trends of falling newspaper and magazine sales generally and the increasing popularity of free of charge content online have had an impact on Irish language publications also. The advent of the digital era in particular and the obvious advantages attaching to instantaneous updating and lower distribution and production costs, bring major implications for media in the future. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to learn that results in relation to take up of these publications have been very positive.  However, I should add that, as these contracts will expire at the end of 2018, Foras na Gaeilge is currently carrying out an appraisal of its existing schemes.</p></reply>
