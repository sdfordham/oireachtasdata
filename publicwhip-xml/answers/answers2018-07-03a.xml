    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-03a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070300067#WRA00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 36 together.</p>  <p>As the House is aware I am obliged under legislation to: </p>  <p>  1. review the operation and effectiveness of the FEMPI legislation, having regard to the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness; and</p>  <p>  2. consider whether the relevant Acts continue to be necessary, having regard to amongst other things the revenues of the State.</p>  <p>  My review for 2018 was submitted to the Oireachtas last Friday the 29th June in accordance with the legislation.</p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts have been a cornerstone of fiscal consolidation. Over the period 2008 &ndash; 2014 FEMPI pay measures were responsible for a &euro;2.1 billion reduction in the public service pay bill. </p>  <p>  Responsible management of the public service pay bill has allowed the Government to prioritise recruitment to public services. In total between Q4 2013 and Q1 2018 an additional 32,075 public servants have been recruited to meet demands for enhanced public service delivery. These include 7,941 teachers, 3,470 Special Needs Assistants, 2,726 Health and Social Care Professionals, 4,234 nurses and 1,832 consultants/doctors/dentists. </p>  <p>  Progress across other socio-economic priorities would not be possible to the same extent if the FEMPI legislation was repealed in one Budget year.  For this reason we have negotiated a gradual and sustainable exit from the FEMPI acts with the commitment of approx &euro;1.3bn through the Public Service Stability Agreement and the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act which the Oireachtas passed in December of last year. This agreement and legislation will complete the unwinding of the emergency legislation that we commenced with the Lansdowne Road Agreement. The gradual and negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation delivers on commitments made under the confidence and supply agreement and the programme for partnership government.</p>  <p>  The terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 facilitated by the enactment of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, delivers real pay benefits to public servants ranging from 7.4% to 6.2% with the greater benefits going to the lower paid. The Agreement provides fair pay increases to public servants, is fair to tax payers and enables us to make progress in other areas that are important to our society, particularly capital investment in our schools, towns and hospitals. </p></reply>

The Office of Public Works (OPW) has a long-standing working relationship with the Department of Infrastructure, Rivers (Dfl Rivers) which is the competent authority for the implementation of the &lsquo;EU Floods Directive&rsquo; in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the OPW and Dfl Rivers agreed to establish a Cross-Border Co-ordination Group to co-ordinate the implementation of the &lsquo;EU Floods Directive&rsquo; across the border. This work was supported by a Cross-Border Technical Co-ordination Group. These groups have met on a number of occasions to co-ordinate their respective work to screen and assess the flood risk and to prepare plans to manage flood risk in border areas.</p>  <p>  The Erne Catchment was assessed under the OPW&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme, in close co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure, Northern Ireland. The study considered increasing watercourse conveyance of the Erne system to lower water levels as a measure to reduce flood risk.  This study revealed that water levels in the majority of the Erne catchment in Ireland, remain unchanged regardless of any works that could be carried out in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The OPW does not have Arterial Drainage Schemes on the River Erne system in County Cavan and is not responsible for channel maintenance in the area in accordance with its statutory requirements under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. However parts of the Erne Catchment are a Drainage District for which the local authority is responsible for ongoing maintenance.</p></reply>

Decisions on how and where those allocations are invested by Departments are a matter, in the first instance, for my ministerial colleagues. </p>  <p>  The ten-year National Development Plan (NDP) has been put in place to underpin the implementation of the National Planning Framework (NPF) and to support the development of all counties and regions, both urban and rural areas, including County Donegal.</p>  <p>  Total funding of &euro;8.8 billion is allocated to the Strategic Outcome of strengthened rural economies and communities which is a cornerstone of NDP, including in relation to the delivery of the National Broadband Plan and significant investment in regional and local roads.  The NDP also contains, as a priority, increased investment in public transport and ongoing investment in the Local Link Programme.  </p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, the NDP represents a particular step change for the northern part of the island of Ireland, including Donegal and the North-West. For example, the NDP provides for investment to support the ambition for development of the region such as the N2/A5 road serving Meath, Monaghan and Donegal. </p>  <p>  A major capital projects tracker was published in September 2017 on the website of my Department.  This tracker is currently being updated following the launch of the NDP and the updated version will be published shortly which will feature details of the key projects being implemented under the Plan.  </p>  <p>  Under the NPF the three Regional Assemblies are now responsible for co-ordinating, promoting and supporting the strategic planning and sustainable development of their regions, consistent with the objectives of the NPF, through the preparation of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES).  The strategy for the Northern and Western Region provides the opportunity for the priorities for Donegal, for example the priorities included in the existing County Development Plan, to focus on sustainable growth, quality of life and on achievable employment and population growth within Donegal and the Northern and Western Region to be integrated into a regional investment plan which is expected to be a major driver of the implementation of the NPF.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-03a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070300067#WRA01600"><p>As outlined in the Summer Economic Statement published last month, the Government is determined to ensure that the budgetary strategy is based on steady increases in public expenditure underpinned by stable and predictable tax revenues. To deliver on this objective it is essential that expenditure increases to deliver improvements in services are affordable and sustainable over the medium-term. This will require prioritisation and realism in the allocation of resources and a focus on the extent to which public spending is delivering on key policy objectives. </p>  <p>  Taking into account risks in the external environment, the Government will prioritise spending that mitigates risk, enhances resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity.  This is the context for Project Ireland 2040 and the capital expenditure allocations set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2017 (NDP). The increases in investment set out in the NDP will move Ireland&rsquo;s public capital investment, as a share of national income, from relatively low levels following the recent recession to amongst the highest in the EU. </p>  <p>  Public Service Reform has consistently been a key priority, with a comprehensive series of reforms having been implemented since the first Public Service Reform Plan was published in November 2011. The current plan, Our Public Service 2020, sets a path for improvements beyond 2020.   </p>  <p>  Irish public debt remains high, with the debt-to-GNI* ratio at an estimated 100 per cent last year. Such elevated debt levels weigh on the capacity of the public finances to respond to any economic downturn in the future. Therefore, we must continue to pursue a prudent budgetary policy so that we have room for manoeuvre in the event of a major shock to the economy at some point in future.</p></reply>

Last year the Budget for the health sector was increased by almost 3.6% bringing the total funding to a record level of &euro;15.3bn. In 2016 Ireland ranked sixth highest in terms of healthcare spend per capita out of all OECD countries.</p>  <p>  There has also been a significant increase in the level of staffing.  Since the beginning of 2015 to the end of Q1 2018, health staff numbers have increased by over 12,000 FTEs (12 per cent) to 112,526 FTEs. This growth represents nearly half of the increase in total public service staffing in the same period.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the recent Summer Economic Statement, given the scale of overall expenditure in the health sector, and the additional resources allocated over the last four years, it is crucial that the Health allocation is managed effectively by the Department of Health and the HSE. </p>  <p>  There is an ongoing process for monitoring expenditure in the Department of Health which includes the submission of monthly returns and regular meetings at Ministerial and official level.  The Mid-Year Expenditure Report will review the overall expenditure position, outline further details of emerging trends at that stage, and also examine the scope for the provision of additional funding if necessary. </p></reply>

The impact of Brexit will depend on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations. While this poses challenges in planning our response, it is important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is in a strong position to deal with these challenges. As set out in the Summer Economic Statement the central scenario for fiscal and economic planning purposes in Ireland is that a transition arrangement will be agreed that will cover the period from end-March next year until end-2020.  </p>  <p>  Supporting the areas of our economy that may find themselves significantly impacted by Brexit has already been a key element of the Government&rsquo;s response. To this end, Budget 2018 provided for additional expenditure amounts specifically for Brexit-related measures across a number of Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation; the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  Taking into account risks in the external environment, in particular Brexit, the Government will prioritise spending that mitigates risk, enhances resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity.  This is the context for Project Ireland 2040 and the capital expenditure allocations set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2017 (NDP). The increases in investment set out in the NDP will move Ireland&rsquo;s public capital investment, as a share of national income, from relatively low levels following the recent recession to amongst the highest in the EU. &euro;5.8 billion has been allocated to gross voted capital expenditure this year. This is to be increased by an additional &euro;1.5 billion next year to &euro;7.3 billion. Further increases in the coming years will bring the annual investment up to &euro;8.6 billion in 2021. </p></reply>

This Memorandum of Understanding has a specific focus with agreeing a basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on flood relief schemes completed by the OPW to an agreed standard of protection desired by the industry.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the Office of Public Works to Insurance Ireland in respect of twelve completed flood defence schemes; showing the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Details of a further five schemes were provided in January 2015 and details of the Waterford Flood Defence Scheme were provided last year. </p>  <p>  The Department of Finance and the OPW meet with Insurance Ireland on a quarterly basis in order to address issues in relation to this transfer of data. The insurance sector has acknowledged that demountable defences are designed and when properly erected meet the desired standard. The OPW has given Insurance Ireland detailed information it sought to explain the protocols and procedures in place to maintain, test and erect demountable defences. Discussions are continuing with the Department of Finance to explore options to address the industry&rsquo;s concerns about the &lsquo;human element&rsquo; of demountable defences.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum notes the OPW requirement that, when assessing exposure to flood risk, insurers take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed flood defence schemes. The Memorandum does not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations for which information has been provided by the OPW, and it accepts that the provision of cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers</p></reply>

This was particularly the case when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in terms of its ability to fund infrastructure directly.  The fact that PPPs use private finance, on an off-balance sheet basis, enabled a number of key projects to proceed which would not otherwise have been deliverable on the basis of Exchequer funding alone.</p>  <p>  In ensuring Departments obtain the best value-for-money from public capital investment, PPPs, are subject to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as traditionally procured projects.  All projects over &euro;20m are required under the Public Spending Cote to be subject to a Cost Benefit Analysis or Cost Effectiveness Analysis.  In addition, all public investment projects of this value must also be referred to the National Development Finance Agency for advice in terms of the options for financing and procuring the projects.   </p>  <p>  As outlined in the NDP, and as recommended by the PPP Review, PPPs will continue to feature as a procurement option available to Government for appropriately structured projects which demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option and which meet the robust and rigorous tests for project appraisal that apply to all public investment projects under the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  While there are a number of previously announced PPP projects in the pipeline for delivery over the coming years, no further specific additional projects have been identified in the NDP for procurement by PPP at this stage.  Rather, it is essential that projects are judged on their merits, on a case by case basis, and if procurement by PPP is found to offer better value-for-money than traditional procurement in the case of the various projects identified for delivery in the NDP, then they should be selected and progressed by the relevant sponsoring Department or agency on that basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-03a.62.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018070300067#WRA06100"><p>The Public Private Partnership (PPP) model is an internationally recognised model to design, build, finance, operate and maintain public infrastructure. In accordance with international best practice, PPP contracts already typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to protect the public interest and ensure that the project proceeds to completion.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of such PPP contracts, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium&rsquo;s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State.  Liquidation of a company involved in delivering a public infrastructure project is an unfortunate and unforeseen development but would impact on any project where a supplier became insolvent during the delivery process, regardless of whether the project was being procured by PPP or by traditional means. The issue, therefore, is not PPP-specific, but where it arises in a PPP project, the provisions of the PPP contract ensure that the public interest is protected.</p>  <p>  It is worth bearing in mind that this is not the first time a PPP in Ireland has experienced issues with its construction contractor, which is not uncommon given the risks inherent in the construction market. In all previous similar cases, the projects were completed successfully and are now fully operational. These examples demonstrate the resilience of the PPP contractual structure and underline the importance of adhering to the contractual documentation in resolving issues - which has previously been raised as a negative feature associated with PPPs.</p>  <p>  In these circumstances, I think the current focus should be on resolving the immediate practical issues arising from the untimely and unfortunate liquidation of both Sammon and Carillion. Once these matters are fully and satisfactorily resolved, and the Schools Bundle is delivered to the Sponsoring Agency, I would be open to a review of the experience with the project at that point, that explores any lessons to be learned.</p></reply>

This commitment was recently renewed in the Government's innovation and development framework, Our Public Service 2020.</p>  <p>  Decisions to outsource functions are reached on a case-by-case basis by the organisation or public service body that manages the service or function in question.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s role is to support public service bodies in exploring all service delivery options that are available to them and to ensure evidence-informed decisions are made when selecting a delivery model. In order to meet that objective, the Department has undertaken a substantial programme of learning and development over a number of recent years to up-skill public service managers on best practice around outsourcing using evidence-based techniques.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not intend to undertake a whole-scale review of outsourcing of all public service work. It should be noted that, in line with existing expenditure policy, public bodies are generally required to examine a number of different factors when exploring the potential to outsource a function. These include issues such as costs, quality, service effectiveness and the public interest. This continues to be the case in respect of any new service that is being considered for delivery by public bodies.</p>  <p>  In concluding the Lansdowne Road Agreement in the summer of 2015, a limitation was placed on the ability of public bodies to outsource existing services. In particular, a restriction was introduced which prevented direct comparisons being made between total labour costs for direct provision of a service against the total labour costs of a potential outsourced provider in the preparation of the business case. This limitation remained in place following the extension to the Lansdowne Road agreement concluded in 2017.</p>  <p>  The restriction only applies in respect of existing services, that is, services that are currently being provided directly by the State or its agents. It does not apply in respect of newly conceived or planned services.</p></reply>

The agreement does not specify any emissions reduction targets for individual parties to the agreement. </p>  <p>  However Ireland, in common with all EU Member States, has signed up to deliver its contribution to the Paris Agreement through the EU&rsquo;s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution. This commits the EU to collectively delivering a reduction in emissions of at least 40% by 2030 against 1990 levels. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this overall EU target has been set at a 30% reduction in national emissions by 2030 against 2005 levels. </p>  <p>  Co-ordination of the national approach to achieving this target is, in the first instance, a matter for my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. However, my Department remains in close contact with the Minister&rsquo;s Department in relation to any Exchequer implications arising out of compliance with this target.  </p>  <p>  It is the long standing practice not to comment on measures which may or may not be included in the upcoming Budget. However, in relation to taxation I can say that as part of the joint research programme between the Department of Finance and the ESRI, the ESRI has carried out an analysis which examines the impacts of increasing the carbon tax rate in Ireland.  This paper analyses the economic, environmental and households impacts of increasing the carbon tax rate using an Energy Social Accounting Matrix.  The findings of the paper together with a number of other policy options in respect of energy and environmental taxation are due to be presented to the Tax Strategy Group in July.  </p>  <p>  On expenditure, the Deputy will note that the Government recently demonstrated its commitment to addressing climate change with an unprecedented &euro;22 billion capital funding allocation for climate initiatives over the next decade as part of the National Development Plan (NDP). This will be complemented by a further &euro;8.6 billion investment in sustainable mobility measures. This commitment marks a step change in public investment on climate action and will demonstrate that Ireland is serious about meeting our climate commitments. </p></reply>

This review differs from previous Comprehensive Reviews of Expenditure, with the introduction of a rolling system of selective reviews that will seek to examine the significant portion of current expenditure over the three year period from 2017 to 2019. </p><p>This redesigned process looks to shift the emphasis away from the incremental nature of the annual Estimates process, with a focus instead on assessing the effectiveness of the totality of existing programmes. The rolling three-year nature of the current spending review will allow for the build-up of expertise and awareness of the process, allow analysts to revisit key topics if issues are emerging, and further embed an ongoing evaluation culture across the Public Service. </p><p>Last year&rsquo;s Spending Review culminated in the publication of over 20 analytical papers, most published alongside the Mid-Year Expenditure Report in July, with the remainder published following the publication of Budget 2018 in October last year. Work on this year's Spending Review is still ongoing. It is planned that the Spending Review and associated papers will be published with the Mid-Year Expenditure Report in mid-July. In line with last year a small number of papers may also be published at Budget time in October.  With publication of the Spending Review papers in July, this allows the Spending Review analysis to inform the budgetary discussions that take place as part of the Estimates process. </p><p>The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) is core to delivering the work on the Spending Review. IGEES is an integrated, cross-Government service that aims to support better policy formulation and implementation in the civil service through economic analysis and evaluation.  </p><p>IGEES is not a standalone service. IGEES staff are part of each Department. By operating as a cross Government service, IGEES supports and builds economic and evaluation capacity and consistency across the civil service. IGEES staff in Departments prepare analysis as part of the Spending Review and to inform the annual budgetary process as directed by their Departmental business plans.</p><p>IGEES hosts a Spending Review Conference to provide an opportunity for all Departments to come together to discuss the analysis being conducted to inform the Spending Review. This supports a wider capacity building in analysis and evidence in the Civil Service. It provides a forum for analysts to talk about the challenges in conducting analysis, potential solutions, and how analysis can inform policy choices.</p><p>The IGEES Work Programme for 2018 can be found on the IGEES website at <i></i>.

Also present were EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the UK, Michel Barnier, and Commissioner Hogan.</p>  <p>  The meeting provided an important opportunity to take stock of the state of play in the EU-UK negotiations in advance of the June European Council, notably in relation to the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. In this regard, the Taoiseach and President Juncker were in full agreement that the progress reported in the Joint Statement from EU and UK negotiators of 19 June fell very far short of the EU&rsquo;s expectations.</p>  <p>  I welcome that President Juncker reiterated the EU&rsquo;s full support for Ireland, and that the Protocol, including the backstop, is an integral and indispensable part of the Withdrawal Agreement. This is fully consistent with the strong message of solidarity Ireland received from its EU27 partners at the European Council (Art.50) last week. </p>  <p>  I further welcome that the Conclusions adopted by the European Council (Art. 50) on 29 June sent a clear message to the UK that it must respect the commitments it has made and that, in the absence of agreement on a backstop, it will not be possible to finalise the Withdrawal Agreement as a whole, including the transition arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I and President Juncker shared the view that the talks should intensify with a view to making the necessary progress and I welcome that this has also been reflected in the Conclusions. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I also discussed a number of other important EU issues ahead of the June European Council, in particular migration. While noting Ireland was less directly affected than other Member States, we made clear our wish to play our part in developing a comprehensive EU approach, based on ensuring strong external borders; solidarity between Member States; and working in partnership with countries of origin, including in Africa, to underpin political and economic development, so that people can enjoy better lives and opportunities in their home countries.</p></reply>

In the last six months, for example, the members of the Foreign Affairs Council have held meetings on the margins of the Council with Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Abbas, and the group of Arab Foreign Ministers, as well as discussing the situation in Gaza specifically at their meeting in May.</p>  <p>  The same issues are also discussed regularly at UN level, at the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council.</p>  <p>  In the last year, the United States Government has also been working to develop an initiative to restart negotiations for a final peace agreement.</p>  <p>  Ireland has worked consistently to encourage international attention to this long running conflict. I have made three visits to Israel and Palestine, including Gaza, in my first year in office, and there and elsewhere I have held numerous meetings on the subject with Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, European and American interlocutors.

In the context of the Government&rsquo;s goal of strengthening of alliances with the Nordic and Baltic countries, there have already been six ministerial visits to Denmark this year. Last year, Mr Anders Samuelsen, Foreign Minister of Denmark, visited Dublin and the border region at the invitation of my predecessor, Minister Charlie Flanagan.</p>  <p>  Ahead of the Foreign Affairs Council in April, I hosted a dinner for my Nordic, Baltic and Dutch colleagues, which Minister Samuelsen attended. We also regularly speak to each other at Council meetings. I look forward to visiting Copenhagen at the next suitable opportunity.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of individuals to participate in election observation missions, organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.  The recent practice in Ireland has been for the election observation roster to be set up to include 200 volunteers and to last for five years.  The current roster has been extended for one year until end-2018 to allow sufficient time for the mobilisation of 200 volunteers with appropriate experience and a subsequent vetting process.</p><p>The public call for applications to establish a new roster will issue on 2 July and will be open until 20 August 2018. The call will be published on two Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade websites: <i>www.dfa.ie</i>and <i>www.irishaid.ie</i>and will also be publicised on the Department&rsquo;s social media. </p><p>A candidate information booklet setting out all of the necessary details including the eligibility requirements and the process leading to the establishment of the roster will be on the aforementioned websites. In addition, this material can be emailed to applicants upon request.  All candidates will be required to complete and submit a detailed written application setting out their educational and other formal qualifications, ICT skills, languages, regional and country experience, employment details and references. </p><p>In terms of the selection of candidates for the new roster, candidates will need to demonstrate for the first qualifying stage that they meet the essential criteria set out in the application booklet. The second stage is a qualitative scoring of their application under specific headings related to election observation and democratisation.  </p><p>The process to appoint these volunteers to the roster will be managed by the Election Observation Desk in the Department and the volunteer mobilisation will be run in accordance with established best practice.</p></reply>

The Convention states that signatories shall ensure that children shall not be separated from their parents against their will, unless such a separation is necessary for the best interests of the child.  </p>  <p>  As I stated in my contribution to the D&aacute;il debate, I cannot see any way in which a policy of separating children from their parents in such circumstances could be said to be in the best interests of children. </p>  <p>  In advance of the D&aacute;il debate, I spoke that afternoon with the Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires in the US Embassy in Dublin, Mr. Reece Smyth, and conveyed to him the Government&rsquo;s strong views on the issue.  He undertook to convey those views without delay to the relevant authorities in Washington DC. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to see that, following the grave concerns which were expressed both domestically and internationally about the use of this policy, President Trump signed an Executive Order on the afternoon of June 20, Washington DC time, aimed at ending the practice of separation.  I welcome this move towards a more humane practice of border protection and immigration control. </p>  <p>  I very much hope that we have seen the last of this unwarranted practice and the priority now must be reuniting all of the affected children with their parents, without delay. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Article IV process is a requirement for all members of the Fund and takes place on a periodic, usually annual, basis. It is a long-standing element of Ireland&rsquo;s regular engagement with the IMF and focusses on medium to longer-term policy issues. This year&rsquo;s report recognises Ireland&rsquo;s continued strong economic growth, leading to a rapid reduction in unemployment and strengthened public and private balance sheets. It also notes that our economy continues to grow at a pace well above the EU average and is approaching full employment. The report outlines that the outlook is expected to remain favourable, although significant external risks, in particular Brexit and an escalation in global protectionism, will pose challenges.</p></reply>

The local public banks in Germany are called Sparkassen. The structure of the local public banking system means that these Sparkassen are not permitted to operate outside particular, specified geographic areas. The philosophy of local public banking is not profit maximisation. Instead, Sparkassen aim to promote the development of the local, regional economy of the area in which they operate. An important aspect of the business model of Sparkassen is building relationships and working closely with the SMEs located in their regional area. </p>  <p>  A thorough consideration of the potential for local public banking in Ireland, based on the Sparkassen model, has been carried out by officials in my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development. This work included a public consultation exercise, engaging with stakeholders and interested parties, as well as an analysis of a proposal put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group. Consideration of the proposal of how the German model of local public banking could be implemented in Ireland included a number of meetings between officials from both departments and representatives from Irish Rural Link and SBFIC. </p>  <p>  The report on local public banking has now been completed. Minister Ring and I circulated the report to all Government departments for comments and observations and it was jointly brought to Government at a Cabinet meeting in May. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the report has now been approved by Government and I anticipate that it will be ready for publication in the near future. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, there are already significant Government measures in place to support access to finance by Irish SMEs.  These include the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices, the Credit Review Office and the Credit and Counter Guarantee Schemes.  </p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is working with other Government departments to develop tailored and innovative schemes to meet the evolving needs of Irish SMEs, such as the Agricultural Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme I announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018 respectively.</p></reply>

Over the last three years An Post has been part of Personal Micro Credit Scheme (PMC) with the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Department of Employment and Social Protection and other Government agencies.  To date, over 5,000 people have availed of a PMC loan with repayments of over &euro;5 million been made.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with the Department of Communication, Climate Action and Environment to facilitate the future development of An Post&rsquo;s provision of financial services. </p></reply>

Sound budgetary policy respects the rules but must be guided by prudent judgement to avoid repeating the pro-cyclical mistakes of the past.

While a number of the recommendations in the Motor Report are relevant to the area of business insurance &ndash; in particular, the recommendations regarding the Book of Quantum, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission &ndash; it became clear in preparing the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance  that there was also a pressing need to examine the drivers for the rising cost of business insurance.  </p>  <p>The second phase work culminated in the publication on January 25 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, following its approval by Government.  This new Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out, detailed in an Action Plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation. </p>  <p>  The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:</p>  <p>- Increase Transparency:  enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes,</p>  <p>- Review the level of damages in personal injury cases:  request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, and</p>  <p>- Improve the personal injuries litigation framework:  through a number of measures, including: </p>  <p>a.  ensuring potential defendants are notified in sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy; </p>  <p>b.  tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and </p>  <p>c.  ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the Judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.</p>  <p>All 29 actions are scheduled to be implemented before the end of 2019, with 26 due for completion this year.  The fifth Quarterly Progress Update on implementation was published on 11 May and shows that in respect of the actions from the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance due for completion in Q1 2018, all eight deadlines have been met.  </p>  <p>In relation to the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, as you are aware from a recent PQ response, of the 50 separate deadlines set up to the end of Q1 2018 within the Action Plan, 40 have been met, while substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  The sixth Quarterly Progress Update is expected to be published before the end of July 2018 and will focus in particular on the 14 actions &ndash; seven from each of the primary Reports &ndash; due for completion in Q2 2018.</p>  <p>  Both of the primary Reports and all of the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.</p>  <p>The Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance  in parallel with implementing those from the 2017 Motor Report.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses.</p></reply>

Louth, and recognise the serious threat that fuel fraud poses to legitimate business, consumers and the Exchequer.  I am advised by Revenue that tackling fuel fraud has been one of their priorities over recent years. </p>  <p>  While it is very disappointing that incidents such as this still occur, I am advised that the level of such activity is greatly reduced.  I am advised by Revenue that a total of 100 intermediate bulk containers of mineral oil waste have been detected to date in 2018, in Co. Louth.  A further 18 containers were found in Co. Monaghan, but these have been classified as historical dumps that had been previously undiscovered.  These figures compare positively when set against 500 intermediate bulk containers that were detected in 2013. </p>  <p>  The aforementioned improvement reflects the success Revenue has had in tackling this problem and the impact of legislative changes that I and my predecessor introduced over a number of Finance Acts to strengthen Revenue&rsquo;s powers in tackling fraud in the fuel sector.  The measures implemented by Revenue to tackle the problem included the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls and reporting requirements for fuel transactions to minimise the scope for fraud.  It also included a rigorous programme of enforcement action by Revenue.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.</p>  <p>  The industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in curtailing the problem in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past couple of years.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted a random National Sampling Programme in 2016 and 2017, to assess the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programme involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence).  Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the new marker.  No evidence of the new fiscal marker was found in any of the samples tested. </p>  <p>  Although the available evidence to date indicates that the new marker cannot be laundered by conventional methods, I am advised by Revenue that it remains vigilant.  A further sampling programme in 2018 was expanded to include hauliers and other businesses in the transport sector as well as auto fuel traders.  Data from this sampling programme is currently under analysis.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud has delivered significant success, that Revenue is alert to the resourcefulness of those involved in fuel fraud, and that appropriate action in this area continues to be a high priority.  I will fully consider any additional proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue which would enhance its capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in this area.</p></reply>

The current eligibility criteria include a suggested minimum asset size of &euro;75 million, reflecting the need for significant initial investment in start up initiatives of this nature.  This also recognises the importance of transaction volume necessary for scale discounts which requires the participation of larger credit unions.  The business of providing payment service instruments such as debit cards on current accounts is a complex, sophisticated and regulated business activity requiring a distinct business model and associated risk management capabilities and capacities.  Furthermore, the provision of such services requires ongoing investment, volume pricing and access to technical expertise which given typical credit union size is likely to require a shared service model. </p><p>The suggested limit of &euro;75 million may be re-examined once the framework is established and operational, at which stage, smaller credit unions will have greater clarity regarding cost, experience and operational considerations necessary for informed decision making on participation. </p><p>Details and applications forms are available on the Central Bank website: <i></i>.  The Central Bank has also indicated it is open to applications for alternative debit card proposals and recommends the MPCAS framework as a scalar template for such alternative proposals.</p><p>The Central Bank has approved 46 credit unions for MPCAS and have another 6 in progress.  Combined these 52 credit unions have c&euro;7.6 billion in assets.</p><p>The Government wants not only strong, vibrant credit unions offering a safe and secure place for members' savings but also credit unions being appropriately positioned to offer their members a wide range of services including loans, debit card facilities and new products and services based on the needs of their membership.</p></reply>

This data is not held in my Department. </p>  <p>  Pay band data that is available to my Department indicates that some 94% of all public service staff are on salary points in excess of &euro;25,000 per annum.  The suggested wage at &euro;11.70 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;22,589. </p>  <p>  Any of those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;22,589 could be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested living wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested living wage through incremental progression.</p>  <p>  Data based on Civil Service staff only at end of May 2018 indicates that only some 1% of staff in the Civil Service are on salary points less than &euro;22,589. Within the Civil Service, there are just below 1,000 staff members on less than &euro;11.70 per hour.  The grades involved include temporary clerical officers, services officers, and service attendants. </p>  <p>  The estimated cost within the civil service, which is some 12% of the overall public service, would be some &euro;3.6m (Headcount).  Detailed costings in other sectors of the public service would require collation and estimation on an individual sector level. </p>  <p>  Under the new Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, from January 2018 pay rates in the public service have been further adjusted.  The pay increases provided for under the Agreement are again progressively weighted towards the lower paid with benefits ranging from 7.4% to 6.2% over the term to end 2020.  As a result, further pay rises under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 will act to increase staff numbers earning above the living wage. </p></reply>

The CFRAM programme culminated with the launch on 3 May, 2018 of 29 flood risk management plans which propose 118 new outline flood relief projects on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW).  All of these projects are to be funded under the Government's 10 year flood risk investment programme of almost &euro;1 billion under the National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027.  </p>  <p>  As it is not possible to progress all 118 proposed new schemes at once, funding of &euro;257 million for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country was also announced which would be progressed to detailed design and construction, including the five largest schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small or minor projects under &euro;1 million which will be progressed directly by local authorities.  Aside from the 5 largest schemes and the 31 small or minor projects, the remaining projects in the initial phase of implementation were selected on the basis of those projects which would provide the greatest benefit in terms of the greatest number of properties protected on a regionally balanced basis.</p>  <p>  A proposed flood relief scheme at Rathcormac has been identified by the CFRAM programme to be progressed at a projected cost of &euro;1.15 million.  This proposed scheme consists of the diversion of flood flows from the Kilbrien Stream via a culvert to the Shanowen River and will protect 31 properties when completed. </p>  <p>  The proposed scheme is not in the first tranche of projects to be progressed but the OPW and the local authority will work closely to ensure that it will be commenced as soon as possible within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.   </p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress the scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies as well as the general public takes place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the scheme. </p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is reporting to Government on expenditure levels.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against published expenditure profiles and this information is published each month with the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  As set out in the May Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, overall gross voted expenditure by Departments to end-May 2018 was &euro;24,099 million.  This was &euro;276 million, or 1.1%, below profile and an increase of &euro;1,712 million, or 7.6%, on the same period in 2017. </p>  <p>  Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;22,671 million was broadly on profile, and up &euro;1,496 million year-on-year.  Ten of the 17 Vote groups were at or below profile on current expenditure. Gross current expenditure of &euro;6,304 million by the Health Vote was &euro;67 million, or 1.1%, ahead of profile.  Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;8.165 million by the Employment Affairs and Social Protection Vote was &euro;25 million, or 0.3%, above profile.  The Justice Vote group was &euro;34 million, or 3.4%, ahead of profile, with gross voted current expenditure of &euro;1,029 million.  This overrun relates primarily to Garda pay.  Four other Votes were slightly above profile on current expenditure: Housing, Planning and Local Government; Education and Skills; Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Public Expenditure and Reform group was on profile for current expenditure.</p>  <p>  Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;1,429 was &euro;285 million, or 16.6%, below profile at end-May and up &euro;216 million, or 17.8%, year-on-year.  All 16 Vote groups with capital expenditure are below profile.  The main driver of this underspend is the Housing, Planning and Local Government Vote, which is &euro;157 million, or 35.4%, below profile.  This is largely due to timing issues relating to payments to Irish Water.

As outlined in the Summer Economic Statement, published last month, the Government is determined to ensure that the budgetary strategy is based on steady increases in public expenditure underpinned by stable and predictable tax revenues.  To deliver on this objective it is essential that expenditure increases to deliver improvements in services are affordable and sustainable over the medium-term.  This will require prioritisation and realism in the allocation of resources and a focus on the extent to which public spending is delivering on key policy objectives.</p>  <p>  As such, as the economy has recovered, Government has provided for increases in public expenditure in recent years.  While increases in expenditure have impacted broadly across all sectors, a particular focus has been placed on ensuring the areas of Health, Housing, Education and Social Protection are sufficiently funded to support the Government&rsquo;s social goal for a fairer and more inclusive society.  </p>  <p>  It is imperative that these additional resources are managed in a prudent and efficient manner by each Government Minister and Department.  Therefore, officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are in regular contact with all Government Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is reporting to Government on expenditure levels.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against published expenditure profiles and this information is published each month with the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  The Government must prioritise spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity.  In this context, the Government has set out its vision for Ireland over the medium term through the publication of Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan.  With this plan, investment levels in Ireland will continue to increase at a sustainable rate and modern public infrastructure will be delivered over the coming years which will improve the lives of people throughout Ireland and allow our companies and economy to continue to compete in a globalised world.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is also important that we continue to reform and enhance the way public services are delivered.  This can be achieved by applying management accountability, raising efficiency, technological progress and other means.  By better aligning inputs with outputs, we can ensure better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money and improve the efficiency with which these monies are allocated.  The spending review, which will be published in July, will be critical in this regard by supporting an evidence based approach to policy, and helping to ensure the consistent evaluation of existing expenditure through systematic reviews of expenditure programmes across all sectors of Government. </p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for developing and setting out the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland. In this regard, the OGP has developed the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which consists of 5 strands:</p>  <p>  - Legislation (Directives, Regulations)</p>  <p>  - Government Policy (Circulars, etc.)</p>  <p>  - Capital Works Management Framework for Public Works</p>  <p>  - General Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services</p>  <p>  - More detailed technical guidelines, template documentation and information notes as issued periodically by the OGP</p>  <p>  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procurement procedures to be followed by public bodies.  The framework supports contracting authorities, including the OGP, the four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, when awarding contracts for works, goods and services.  It enables public bodies to adopt procedures to meet their Public Procurement requirements and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules.</p>  <p>  Last July, my colleague Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, Minister of State with special responsibility for Public Procurement, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules. </p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting that while the OGP guidelines facilitate and enable compliance with public procurement rules, it is the responsibility of each Contracting Authority to ensure they adhere to these rules.</p>  <p>  The OGP supports compliance by putting in place compliant procurement solutions, publishing guidelines and template documentation and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the OGP's Key Account Managers are in regular contact with Procurement Officers in Government Departments and State Bodies to assist, support and remind them of their obligations in relation to public procurement.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, and the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and Accounting Officers are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred. Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement.</p></reply>

Detailed work is taking place across Departments and in State agencies to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU.  This includes contingency planning; engagement with stakeholders; support to companies from the enterprise agencies; and work to exploit any opportunities that might arise from Brexit.</p>  <p>  Within my own Department a dedicated Brexit/EU/North South Unit is responsible for coordinating the response to Brexit across the Department and it plays a full role in the cross-Departmental structures that support the work of Government. Brexit issues are also addressed by staff in relevant areas across the Department.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, is now well advanced.  Its focus is on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern. </p>  <p>  It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors and examining legislative actions which may be needed at EU level.</p>  <p>  The risks arising from Brexit are reflected in the Government&rsquo;s National Risk Assessment, which identifies areas where Brexit poses a specific risk, particularly in relation to the economy.  This approach is reflected in my own Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy for 2016-2019 and also in its Risk Register.</p></reply>

Minister Bruton is meeting with representatives from the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) later this week to discuss the report and its recommendations.</p>  <p>  Securing skills supply from the education and training to the construction sector is a major focus of my Department as part of broader Government actions to increase housing supply and roll out the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework. Construction related apprenticeship registrations increased from 1,713 in 2015 to 2,314 in 2016 which represents an increase of 35%. This trend continued in 2017 with a further increase of 28% on the 2016 figure bringing the total number of construction related registrations to 2,963 which represented over 60% of all new registrations last year.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme, which aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market. Consequently, the number of construction related apprentices being registered is determined by employers within the construction sector. My Department and SOLAS are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector. Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, SOLAS and the Apprenticeship Council are reviewing pathways to apprenticeship.  The review report, due to be published shortly, will identify barriers that exist to participation in apprenticeship programmes and make recommendations for the future.  This may include looking at support for employers taking on apprentices from under-represented groups and practical support for smaller employers engaging with the apprenticeship system.</p>  <p>  Some of the recommendations contained in the CIF report refer to changes to the NTF levy to employers. As part of Budget 2018, it was decided to raise the rate of the NTF levy by 0.1% in 2018 to 0.8% and, subject to progress on a series of reforms, by a further 0.1% in both 2019 and 2020.  One of these reforms is a comprehensive and independent review of the National Training Fund (NTF) to guide strategic decisions on its structure and future direction in order to inform Budget 2019. This review will be completed shortly. It should be noted that most schemes internationally that allow rebates for employers who train directly only apply where that training is provided and funded by the employer.  There are issues with a proposal that employers who benefit most from investment from the NTF contribute less than other employers to the levy.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that employers engaged in craft based apprenticeships are benefitting significantly from the National Training Fund (NTF) as the apprentices in these programmes are paid a training allowance equivalent to their wages by their local Education and Training Board during their off-the-job training phases. This is not the case in the new consortia-led apprenticeships where the employer pays the apprentice's wage for the full duration of the apprenticeship. Further financial assistance to employers in the construction sector needs to be considered in that context.  This year &euro;122m has been allocated from the NTF to apprenticeship training, an increase of almost 24% on the previous year. </p>  <p>  I am very interested in exploring mechanisms of supporting smaller employers to engage with the apprenticeship system and considering further some of the recommendations in the CIF report. Work is already underway on developing a the shared  apprenticeship scheme.  SOLAS in partnership with CIF and Waterford Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB) operated a pilot initiative in the last year to test the viability of such a scheme.  Following analysis of the pilot outcomes and in consultation with both the CIF and WWETB, I understand that SOLAS decided not to operationalise the pilot initiative more widely.  In particular, it was found that the pilot did not attract employers in sufficient numbers to suggest that the scheme had the potential to have a significant impact on apprenticeship recruitment.  However, I understand from SOLAS that they are currently in discussions with representatives from the construction industry to assess how the scheme could be made more viable.</p></reply>

Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers in the sector.</p>  <p>  Over the last number of years the number of employers registering apprentices to the craft of print media has significantly declined. Out of the 145 apprentices who were registered on the print media apprenticeship between 2006-2017 only 87 completed their apprenticeship and gained certification.  Due to the low participation level, in September 2016 SOLAS suspended registrations in the print media programme and undertook to engage with the sector to see how the programme could be updated and made fit for future purpose.</p>  <p>  I understand from SOLAS that in 2017 the Irish Printing Federation carried out a survey of the industry to ascertain the level of support for an apprenticeship on an ongoing basis. The findings from the survey indicated there was insufficient support from industry to sustain an apprenticeship in the sector. Engagement took place with SOLAS and the print media industry early in 2018. In light of this, SOLAS has paused the apprenticeship until such time as there is sufficient support from the sector. Any capital funding for the programme would be determined as part of this updating process.</p></reply>

In 2016, AHEAD in partnership with the National Learning Network (NLN), published a report called &lsquo;Mental Health Matters&rsquo;, a study into the experiences of students with mental health difficulties.  The study found that the majority of HEIs have services supporting students with mental health difficulties and some institutions have dedicated services for students. </p>  <p>  The report made a number of recommendations such as the promotion of mental health awareness to students on their induction, the provision of mental health awareness at institutional level for staff, and institutions adopting a whole of campus strategic response to meet the needs of students experiencing mental health difficulties. Implementation of the recommendations is being progressed by AHEAD and its partners. </p>  <p>  The HEA also plan to work with the HSE to develop national guidance for higher education institutions in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which may exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides a range of services for students in HEA funded higher education institutions, including supports provided by Access Offices.

The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need. </p><p>From 21st March 2017, the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behavioural Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for Children who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing and Children who are Blind/Visually Impaired (VTHVI) transferred from my Department to the NCSE and joined with the services already being provided by NCSE&rsquo;s SENOs and administrative staff to form the NCSE Support Service. This service aims to develop schools&rsquo; capacity to include students with special educational needs and to promote a continuum of educational provision which is inclusive and responsive.</p><p>Students with Dyspraxia may be entitled to additional teaching provision in school, under the new model for allocating special education teachers, which was introduced in September 2017. Under this model, schools are provided with an allocation for special educational support teaching to support all students who need such support.</p><p>Schools now have greater discretion as to how they can deploy resources, to take account of the actual learning needs students have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability.</p><p>My Department have published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under this allocation model.

The NCSE Support Service provides Continuing Professional Development (CPD) support for teachers of pupils with Dyspraxia through an Inclusive Learning Resource Teachers course as well as an online resource facility and an online book borrowing facility.</p><p>Post primary school students with special needs may have special arrangements made for them while sitting State examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate.

However, I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year. In that regard it is critical that any additional resources that are available in the education sector are utilised in such a way as to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2018 marked the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion. Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p><p>Improvements have been made for the restoration of grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  </p><p>The level of funding provided to all schools and the drivers of costs at school level are kept under review by my Department.</p><p>The following tables summarise the value of capitation related grants that would be payable to recognised Primary schools (non-DEIS) of various sizes in 2017 and 2018. The commitments in the Action Plan including to increase capitation funding, will be considered in the context of the budgetary process.</p><p><b>2017</b><table><tr><th>Pupil Enrolment</th><th>Rate per pupil</th><th>20</th><th>60</th><th>200</th><th>300</th><th>500</th><th>600</th></tr><tr><td>Capitation</td><td>&euro;170.00</td><td>&euro;10,200</td><td>&euro;10,200</td><td>&euro;34,000</td><td>&euro;51,000</td><td>&euro;85,000</td><td>&euro;102,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ancillary Grant</td><td>&euro;158.00</td><td>&euro;9,480</td><td>&euro;9,480</td><td>&euro;31,600</td><td>&euro;47,400</td><td>&euro;79,000</td><td>&euro;79,000</td></tr><tr><td>Book Grant</td><td>&euro;11.00</td><td>&euro;660</td><td>&euro;660</td><td>&euro;2,200</td><td>&euro;3,300</td><td>&euro;5,500</td><td>&euro;6,600</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Capitation related funding</td><td></td><td>&euro;20,340</td><td>&euro;20,340</td><td>&euro;67,800</td><td>&euro;101,700</td><td>&euro;169,500</td><td>&euro;187,600</td></tr></table></p><p><b>2018</b><table><tr><th>Pupil Enrolment</th><th>Rate per pupil</th><th>20</th><th>60</th><th>200</th><th>300</th><th>500</th><th>600</th></tr><tr><td>Capitation</td><td>&euro;170.00</td><td>&euro;10,200</td><td>&euro;10,200</td><td>&euro;34,000</td><td>&euro;51,000</td><td>&euro;85,000</td><td>&euro;102,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ancillary Grant</td><td>&euro;163.00</td><td>&euro;9,780</td><td>&euro;9,780</td><td>&euro;32,600</td><td>&euro;48,900</td><td>&euro;81,500</td><td>&euro;81,500</td></tr><tr><td>Book Grant</td><td>&euro;11.00</td><td>&euro;660</td><td>&euro;660</td><td>&euro;2,200</td><td>&euro;3,300</td><td>&euro;5,500</td><td>&euro;6,600</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Capitation related funding</td><td></td><td>&euro;20,640</td><td>&euro;20,640</td><td>&euro;68,800</td><td>&euro;103,200</td><td>&euro;172,000</td><td>&euro;190,100</td></tr></table></p></reply>

For the 2002/2003 school year, part of the grant was paid in May 2003, with the balance in October 2003.

However, I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year.  In that regard it is critical that any additional resources that are available in the education sector are utilised in such a way as to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2018 marked the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion.  Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  Improvements have been made for the restoration of grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  </p>  <p>  The level of funding provided to all schools and the drivers of costs at school level are kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

No charge may be made, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p>  <p>  However, it is permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.  My Department's Circular 0065/2010 clarifies certain charges that may be legitimately requested from pupils.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 which completed Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 30th May 2018 and is currently progressing through the Seanad contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application to a school or for the continued enrolment of a pupil in a school.</p>  <p>  Where a parent is concerned about the manner in which a school is requesting payment of contributions, it is open to that parent to write to the chairperson of the board of management requesting confirmation that the contribution in question is not mandatory and that non-payment of same will not impact on their child being excluded from any part of the school curriculum or from recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part. </p>  <p>  I believe that schools need to be accountable to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities.  Better information for parents, including information in relation to the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that I will be looking at in the context of my Department's work on a Parents' and Students' Charter.</p></reply>

This is the largest number of posts that has ever been available for allocation and will ensure that the Department's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.</p><p>There are also supplementary panel arrangements in place to facilitate SNAs made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.  These arrangements were agreed between management and staff-side representative bodies and are subject to annual reviews by these parties.  The current SNA supplementary assignment panel arrangements for the 2018/19 school year are contained in Circular 34/18 which can be accessed through the following link:<i></i></p><p>Every eligible SNA remains on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment.  If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (set out in Circular 58/06).  Furthermore, Circular 58/06 also provides for compensation for the loss of hours to affected SNAs where the NCSE may have reduced an individual schools' allocation of SNA hours.</p><p>It should also be noted that the supplementary panel arrangements do not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p></reply>

The most recent published information relates to the 2016/2017 school year.  Statistics in relation to the current school year will be published later this year when the data has been compiled.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 marks the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish education and training service the best in Europe within a decade. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provides for an additional 1280 teaching posts in the 2018/19 school year.  This includes a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools including DEIS Band 2 and DEIS Rural categories which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.  These changes will come into effect in September for the 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  It is expected that this one point improvement in the staffing schedule, when implemented in September 2018, will further improve the overall ratio of teacher to students.  The latest figures in relation to pupil-teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.7:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2016/17 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.7 in the same period.</p></reply>

In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion.  Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  The process is underway for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  </p>  <p>  The Minor Works Grant was introduced in 1997 and since then has issued to primary schools each school year with the exception of the 2012/2013 school year.  The payment of the Minor Works Grant is not confined to any particular date and can be issued during any month of the school year.  For the 2002/2003 school year, part of the grant was paid in May 2003, with the balance in October 2003.  The grant in respect of the 2017/2018 school year issued in December 2017. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the Minor Works Grant in respect of the 2018/2019 school year will issue no later than January 2019.</p>  <p>  The rates payable under the Minor Works Grant are &euro;5,500 per school plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream pupil and &euro;74 per special needs pupil attending a special school or a special class.  I wish to confirm that the rates of the Minor Works Grant were not reduced in recent years.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of the Minor Works Grant to primary schools.  The National Development Plan 2018-2027 signals a gradual ramping up in capital expenditure in the schools sector over the coming years.  In that context, and as part of our longer term infrastructural planning, my Department would intend to put the Minor Works Grant on an annual footing and to provide greater certainty to schools on the timing of payments.</p></reply>

It is the case that many teachers who would have been available to carry out substitution work are now gaining permanent and long-term contracts.</p>  <p>  I am aware of reports that some schools are experiencing difficulties in finding substitute teachers.  In order to ease the situation, in the last school year I suspended the limits that teachers on career break can work as substitutes.  Schools were also reminded that, in considering career break applications, the needs of pupils should take precedence and they must take account of the availability of appropriate qualified replacement teachers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I recently established the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  The Group is considering the issues that impact on teacher supply, including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession.  The Steering Group will oversee a programme of actions according to strict timelines and clear deliverables.  In undertaking its task, the Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  At this point the Steering Group, and the working groups reporting to it, have met on a number of occasions.  The Group met again on 29 June and I hope to be in a position to announce further measures in this area over coming months.</p>  <p>  A value for money review of the Supply Teacher Scheme was published in July 2006.  Following that review, it was considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences rather than retaining the supply panel as then constituted. </p></reply>

I, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, negotiated a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers.</p>  <p>   Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently laid before the Oireachtas a report on the matter of the pay of new entrants to the public service.  The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two-scale-point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011.  The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.  The report also acknowledges that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).  Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussion on remaining salary scale issues with the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of newly qualified pay.  That process commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.  Further talks began on the 27th of April with all public service unions in relation to new entrant pay.  Further engagement is being arranged as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue. </p>  <p>  In the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body (issued in December 2007), the Body evaluated the pay and jobs of 109 grades across the public service, including school Principals.  The Body recommended pay increases for 15 grades, including changes to the allowance payable to Principals of primary schools and of small post-primary schools. </p>  <p>  Under the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, it was agreed that the increases recommended in the second report of the PSBB would be paid as follows: </p>  <p>  (a) 5% from 1 September 2008, or where the total increase is less than 5%, the full increase from that date; </p>  <p>  (b) The issue of the payment of any balances will be discussed between the parties in the context of any successor to this Transitional Agreement which might be agreed between the Social Partners, or whatever other arrangements may be in place on the expiry of this Transitional Agreement.</p>  <p>  The pay terms contained in the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 were not implemented due to the State&rsquo;s worsening financial circumstances.

Equipment is provided under this scheme for children with more complex disabilities who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the school's existing IT provision.</p>  <p>  The type of equipment provided under the Assistive Technology scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for students with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Education Needs Officers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for assistive technology support.</p>  <p>  Schools make application directly to the SENO, providing details of the student's special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions.  Professional reports (from psychologists or occupational therapists, for example) must be submitted by the school along with the application.  These reports must have a recent and comprehensive professional assessment of the nature and extent of disability, and outline that the equipment is essential for the pupil to access the curriculum.</p>  <p>  SENOs will review the application and professional reports, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met.  They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required: and based on this recommendation, my Department's officials will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making such recommendations, as set out in Circular 0010/2013.</p>  <p>  Due to obligations under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a temporary pause was applied to the processing of Assistive Technology applications.  This pause was necessitated by the sensitive nature of personal data submitted by schools along with applications, and the requirement for a Joint Data Controller Agreement between the NCSE and my Department.  Pending this agreement, the application form was unavailable on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  My officials advise that the Joint Data Controller Agreement has now been finalised, the new application form is available on the NCSE website, and that schools may submit applications to SENOs, with a view to having same processed in time for the commencement of the next school year in September.</p></reply>

Arising from our first call for apprenticeship proposals in 2015, eleven new apprenticeships have been developed in a wide range of sectors, including financial services, engineering, ICT and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway later in 2018.  Arising from our second call a further 26 new programmes have been approved for further development into national apprenticeships across a wide variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture. </p>  <p>  I understand from SOLAS, that based on the experience of consortia to date it is estimated that the development of an apprenticeship generally take between 12-15 months. There is evidence to suggest this timescale can be shorter as a number of new apprenticeship programmes approved for development in December 2017 are due for roll out in 2018. Some apprenticeship programmes have taken a longer period of time to advance. Many programmes are still in development and in the pipeline for roll out by 2020. </p>  <p>  There are specific and bespoke resources to assist each apprenticeship consortium in both the development and ongoing operational requirements of delivery of the programmes. My Department, its agencies and the Apprenticeship Council are working in close collaboration, with the combined aim of delivering these programmes, to ensure that all possible support and resources are made available to apprenticeship consortia. Members of the Apprenticeship Council and the key stakeholders are continuing to review and assess the apprenticeship infrastructure to continue to support the programmes underway and the expansion planned by 2020.</p></reply>

I have requested INIS to examine this option with a view to developing a policy in this area in the early part of next year. This will consider the type and nationality of travellers that the scheme will be open to and the detail of the applications process. Such a scheme would include carrying out background checks against the applicants to ensure they do not pose a public safety or immigration concern to the State.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015.</p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the DSS and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017.</p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. The Director is also working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations.</p>  <p>  Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible. The Mental Health Commission has recently engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service.  The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework.</p>  <p>  My Department has received an outline implementation plan from the Director which contains monthly milestones for realisation of the objective of an active DSS. As time goes on, every effort will be made by all sides to achieve tightening of the timeframes where possible and the situation will continue to be monitored closely by the Steering Group.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Budget provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

However, a recent submission by the Apartment Owners Network and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government estimates that nearly 500,000 people live in multi-unit developments in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 is to reform the law relating to the ownership and management of common areas of multi-unit developments and to facilitate the fail, efficient and effective management of owners' management companies (OMCs).  These are bodies established for the management of such areas, the membership of which comprise the owners of residential units within the development.</p>  <p>  As regards service charges, the Deputy should note that section 18 of the 2011 Act requires each OMC to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges to fund the costs of insurance, maintenance, cleaning, waste management and other common or shared services in respect of the development concerned. These service charges must be calculated on a transparent basis, be apportioned on an equitable basis between residential unit owners and be approved by the OMC members themselves at a general meeting of the OMC. </p>  <p>  In this way, the Act gives residential unit owners themselves a role in determining the level of annual service charge, the level of services to be funded and the manner in which such services are to be provided.  My Department does not keep statistics relating to the average amount of annual service charges in multi-unit developments.</p></reply>

The programme provides non-EEA national investors with options to invest in Ireland. The criteria for the programme are that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest. </p>  <p>  The immigrant investor is required to make an investment of &euro;1 million in Irish projects for a minimum of three years and on confirmation of receipt of the investment, they receive Stamp 4 residency permission for an initial period of two years and which may thereafter be renewed for 3 years following a review. Any investor who withdraws their investment from a Fund or any other approved investment loses any immigration permission granted under the programme.</p>  <p>  I should point out that the Investment Fund Option under the IIP comprises around 10% of the overall Programme by which investors may invest in Ireland and obtain permission. All Fund applications submitted to the Evaluation Committee for consideration must, in the first instance, be in respect of a Fund approved and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland and must meet the published guidelines of the IIP programme. Any Fund not meeting these requirements would not be considered as a suitable investment vehicle and would not be in compliance with the IIP.</p>  <p>  The article referred to by the Deputy arises from the release of an internal note under the FOI Act by the Central Bank relating to a meeting between officials from the Central Bank and INIS in regard to the IIP. The meeting focussed on the role of the Central Bank in the regulation of Funds operating as part of the IIP.

The obstruction of cycle tracks by illegally parked vehicles, which forces cyclists to merge with other traffic, is unacceptable and makes our roads more dangerous for these vulnerable users. At a time when we wish to encourage healthy and environmentally friendly lifestyles, it is important that we ensure that our roads are as safe as possible for cyclists by robustly enforcing the laws that are intended to protect them.</p>  <p>  Strong enforcement of road traffic laws has played an important role in improving the safety of our roads, leading to 2017 having the lowest number of fatalities on record. I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is vital that we continue to work to reduce this number further and encourage responsible use of our roads by all users through both enforcement and education.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I have recently contacted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to request information on the enforcement strategy in relation to this issue, and to seek assurance that prohibitions on parking on cycle tracks will be strongly enforced. I will contact the Deputy directly upon receipt of a response.</p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities, particularly in the summer months.</p>  <p>  I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Garda management engages extensively with transport operators and a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents of anti-social behaviour.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains close contact with local and senior management in Irish Rail and other transport providers. Garda&iacute; also have a good working relationship with the public transport services providers and patrols of uniformed and plain-clothes Garda&iacute;, including personnel on foot patrols and other community engagement duties, are routinely employed when deemed appropriate by Garda management.</p>  <p>   Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provides for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle this problem head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone. Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding. These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by society in general. We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. </p></reply>

Included in the submissions received was a 97 page submission from a specially-constituted committee of the judiciary.</p>  <p>  Following a commitment in the Programme for Government 2016 regarding a new Judicial Appointments Commission with an independent chair and lay majority, and taking into account the submissions received, a Scheme of a  Bill was published in December 2016 and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in January 2017.  The Scheme, significantly modified following issues which arose in the pre-legislative process, was published as a Bill on 30th May 2017 and has since been passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is awaiting Committee Stage in the other House which is scheduled today.</p>  <p>  GRECO recently produced a Fourth Round Evaluation Draft Interim Compliance Report in relation to Ireland on 11 June 2018 for adoption at the GRECO 80th Plenary meeting held in Strasbourg on 18-22 June.  This Report had been produced in earlier draft in 2017 and Ireland had been given the opportunity to comment on its conclusions.  In relation to the Judicial Appointments Bill that report concluded that the 2014 GRECO recommendation in relation to judicial appointments legislation remained unimplemented, despite a formal Bill having been published and advanced through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  GRECO had also received correspondence from the Irish Judiciary which was critical of the Judicial Appointments Bill both in terms of their view that there had not been adequate consultation in relation to the Bill and their consistent opposition to the proposed composition of the new Commission as regards the appointment of a lay chairperson and lay majority and the number of judges on the Commission.  I very much welcome the fact that the Judiciary were in a position to express their views independently to GRECO and I understand that GRECO themselves also welcomed this.</p>  <p>  GRECO, in this draft compliance report, expressed significant concerns regarding the proposed composition of the new Commission, in particular that a minority of judges and a strong lay representation (including the chairperson), is not in line with European standards.  This conclusion was based on a Recommendation of the Council of Europe from 2010, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 2012, which among other things recommended a judicial appointments body &lsquo;drawn in substantial part from the judiciary&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  My senior officials attended the GRECO plenary meeting in Strasbourg on 18-22 June and explained that Ireland would strongly question a view that the presence of the Chief Justice (as head of the Supreme Court) and the four other Presidents of Courts on the new Commission is anything other than a body &lsquo;drawn in substantial part from the judiciary.&rsquo;  It was also explained that Ireland respectfully disagrees with the suggestion in the Report that Ireland is not in line with European standards in this regard since the  Council of Europe Recommendation relied on does not equate the term &lsquo;substantial part&rsquo; to a majority of judges or, indeed, half of the membership of such a body.  It was also pointed out that the 2010 Recommendation itself specifies, in relation to countries which have judicial appointments bodies where the body both selects and appoints judges, that those bodies should be made up &lsquo;at least half&rsquo; of judges, thus not specifying a majority even in that case. It was also pointed out to the GRECO meeting that the 2010 Recommendation of the Council of Europe also sets specifically that the membership of judicial selection authorities should ensure the widest possible representation and that this is one of the reasons why the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 provides for a large cohort of lay members, carefully and independently selected according to very specific skills and experience criteria, by the Public Appointments Service.  I understand that, following that meeting, GRECO has incorporated amendments to the Interim Compliance Report.</p>  <p>  Finally I might also point out, as was indicated to GRECO, that there are no internationally binding norms in relation to the composition of judicial selection bodies.

The Regulations provide that an EU citizen who is in possession of his or her national identity card or passport may not be refused permission to enter Ireland unless it would be contrary to public policy or would endanger public security to grant him or her permission to enter the State. Restrictions on the right of residence of EU citizens may be imposed on similar grounds.</p>  <p>  The Directive provides that measures taken on grounds of public policy or public security must comply with the principle of proportionality and must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the person concerned. The Directive states that previous criminal convictions shall not, in themselves, constitute grounds for taking such measures. However, a previous criminal record would, where known by the immigration authorities, be a relevant factor in determining whether to permit a person to enter the State as the person could constitute a genuine threat to public policy or public security.</p>  <p>  It is, of course, the case that all persons entering and in the State are required to abide by the laws of the State and in circumstances where they engage in criminal conduct they are liable to investigation and prosecution in respect of that conduct.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the general criminal law and targeted legislation, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, have application for the purpose of protection from racist, xenophobic or other hate attacks. It is an offence to propagate views that are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended to, or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred against a group of persons on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the Traveller community or sexual orientation. Accordingly prosecutions may be brought under the Act where intention to incite hatred is proven or where the likelihood of stirring up hatred is proven regardless of intention.</p>  <p>  I would note for the Deputy that the National Strategy for Migrant Integration includes a number of actions to promote intercultural awareness and to combat racism and xenophobia.  It includes an action to review the current legislation on racially motivated crime with a view to strengthening the law. It also intends to address the issue of under-reporting of racially motivated crime. It is a Whole-of-Government Strategy, in which all branches of Government work together to make our integration vision a reality. That vision is that migrants are facilitated to play a full role in Irish society, that integration is a core principle of Irish life, and that Irish society and institutions work together to promote integration fully. Promoting intercultural awareness and combatting racism is key to achieving this.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities. GNDIU monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis. There are currently a total of 247 Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) appointed to work with minority communities at local level. These officers play a fundamental role in liaising with minority communities and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities and to help prevent hate and racist crime. The GRIDO and ELO's provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also ratified and continues to implement the International UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This year, Ireland will submit its combined Fifth to Seventh periodic reports to the UN Committee. It is due to be approved by the Government shortly and will be transmitted to the UN thereafter. The report has undergone a comprehensive consultation process with civil society and government agencies, and Ireland looks forward to examination by the Committee, to update them on Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing positive progress to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination.</p></reply>

These measures are a further step on the road we have pursued in recent years to significantly reform our protection process.</p><p>Effective access to the labour market will help to alleviate social and economic exclusion for applicants and avoid long-term dependency on the State.  Asylum seekers will have access to additional means to provide for themselves and their families outside of the State&rsquo;s directly provided services and supports while their application is being determined.  Moreover, Ireland is one of the few EU Member States to allow eligible asylum seekers to also engage in self-employment.</p><p>Our accommodation centres will now be put on a statutory basis and an applicant with sufficient earnings may choose to provide their own accommodation in the future.  For those who will be granted protection, this will of course assist their early integration into our society and communities.  For those who are found not to have a protection need, it provides an opportunity to receive an income, which will help them in their reintegration to their home country to rebuild their lives there.</p><p>In May 2017, the Supreme Court found that an absolute ban on the right to seek employment for asylum seekers, where there was no time limit in the decision making process, was unconstitutional.  The Government availed of this opportunity to broaden the scope of reform required and committed Ireland, with the approval of the Oireachtas, to opting-in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive 2013, thereby aligning our position with EU norms and standards.  The Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants while their application is being determined.  Under the Directive, asylum seekers will have access to the labour market nine months from the date when their protection application was lodged, if they have yet to receive a first instance recommendation from the International Protection Office and have cooperated with the process.</p><p>Eligible applicants may apply to the Labour Market Access Unit (LMAU) of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), for a labour market permission (which covers both employment and self-employment).  The permission will be granted to eligible applicants for six months and will be renewable until there is a final decision on their protection application.  Eligible applicants will have access to all sectors of employment, with the exception of the Civil and Public Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Irish Defence Forces.</p><p>An information campaign is being launched to ensure that applicants, employers, trade unions, NGOs and all other relevant bodies are fully informed of the labour market access and eligibility arrangements that will apply.  Full details and an application form will also be available on the INIS website: <i>www.inis.gov.ie.</i></p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy I set out below the general processes that apply in the Irish resettlement model.</p>  <p>  With regard to the EU relocation programme, and indeed refugee resettlement generally, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) which falls under the ambit of the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) within my Department has a coordinating role in respect of all matters related to the settlement of refugees.</p>  <p>  Resettlement in communities is coordinated by an Inter-Agency Working Group chaired by the relevant local authority and with members from relevant agencies such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Education and Welfare Service, the Education and Training Board and the IRPP.  Once a family is resettled in a community, an implementing partner procured by the local authority provides appropriate services for a period of twelve to eighteen months.  The standard model is now focussed on an eighteen month period.  The implementing partner plays a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through their expertise in community integration and relevant supports.  The funding for the implementing partner is provided by the IRPP and the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), both managed under the auspices of my Department.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the programme requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE, Tusla and local authorities are represented on the national Taskforce which oversees delivery of the programme.  The programme is coordinated overall by the IRPP, but service provision remains the responsibility of the relevant statutory entity.</p>  <p>  Local authorities source accommodation for refugees, mainly refugee families, according to a distribution key that takes account of a number of factors, including population size and housing need within the local authority area.  The Irish Red Cross is also managing a programme to secure accommodation pledged by members of the public and this is largely being deployed to meet the needs of single persons, as few accommodation options exist within the local authority sector for this cohort.</p></reply>

It involves insidious and coercive behaviour directed at forcing compliance of another person against their will.  The intimidation can be either explicit or implicit, involving actual, threatened or perceived threats of violence to a person or damage to property.</p>  <p>  The threat of violence to enforce drug debt impacts people's lives greatly and creates an atmosphere of fear within communities, particularly those where there is a concentration of illicit drug markets.  In many instances, such communities are already marginalised and are also having to contend with social and public disorder and other forms of criminality associated with the illicit drugs trade.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will stress that whether or not a family or loved one has paid these debts, this should not be a deterrent to seeking their help, advice and support.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take action in relation to drug related intimidation, particularly where there is a risk of harm, or to the life of a person.</p>  <p>  The problem of drug debt intimidation has been highlighted in the current and previous national drug and alcohol strategies.  Under the 2009 &ndash; 2016 Strategy, the Garda National Drugs Unit and the National Family Support Network developed "The Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme" to respond to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing such intimidation.</p>  <p>  Under the new strategy "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025", the issue is again signalled for further action.  In 2018, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be carrying out an evaluation of the Programme to strengthen its effectiveness and, if appropriate, to develop measures to raise public awareness of the Programme.  The National Family Support Network, who worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop the Programme, will also be carrying out their own evaluation from the perspective of their network.  Both of these evaluations are underway and I look forward to hearing the outcome of them.</p>  <p>  Under the Reporting Programme, an Inspector has been selected in every Garda Division to respond to the issue of drug related intimidation.  These Inspectors are management level personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who liaise directly with their local Superintendent in relation to each individual case.  Persons seeking the assistance of the Inspector in their area may contact him or her to arrange to meet either formally or informally. It is also possible for a person to ask a local family support worker or drugs worker to contact the Inspector for their area, or to ask the National Family Support Network to do so. If anyone experiences difficulty contacting the relevant inspector they can contact the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. The contact details for all Garda Inspectors nominated under the Programme are available on the Garda website.</p>  <p>  In dealing with any complaint of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do so with the utmost regard to the safety and the most effective means to afford the person or family subject to the threat, the best level of security, advice and support.  Confidentiality and security of the persons concerned are paramount for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when dealing with reports under the Programme.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific information sought in relation to the numbers of reports received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme, the resources, training and funding provided to it and the delivery of seminars and briefings to local Garda Management, I have requested a report from the Acting Garda Commissioner in each of these respects, with specific reference to the position in County Louth.</p>  <p>  When this report is to hand I will respond further to the Deputies.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of Louth Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 312. There are also 23 Garda Reserves and 31 Garda civilian staff attached to the Louth Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 76 to the Louth Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Louth Division.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in tabular form the number of Garda&iacute; by Rank in the Louth Division as on 31 May 2018 the latest date for which figures are readily available, as provided by the Commissioner.</p><p><b>STRENGTH OF THE LOUTH DIVISION 31 MAY 2018</b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT </th><th>STATION</th><th>GD</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>SU</th><th>CS</th><th>AC</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>ARDEE</td><td>ARDEE</td><td>21</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEBELLINGHAM</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COLLON</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LOUTH</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>27</td><td>7</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>DROGHEDA</td><td>CLOUGHERHEAD</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DROGHEDA</td><td>89</td><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNLEER</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>95</td><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>DUNDALK</td><td>BLACKROCK</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARLINGFORD</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DRUMAD</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNDALK</td><td>124</td><td>19</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>HACKBALLSCROSS</td><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>OMEATH</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>142</td><td>22</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>166</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH TOTAL</td><td></td><td>264</td><td>43</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>312</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Included in this unprecedented level of funding, almost &euro;100 million has been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for overtime in 2018.</p><p>It is a matter for Garda management to distribute all those resources, including the overtime budget, in accordance with operational need and in order to continue to respond appropriately to organised and other serious crime.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) was allocated its annual budget from the overall Garda Vote at the beginning of 2018 and that there has been no reduction in the allocation to DMR in relation to overtime since that point.  I am further informed that the distribution of resources made by the Garda authorities for overtime in DMR is some &euro;41 million for 2018.</p><p>I am satisfied that Garda management is acutely aware of the need to utilise the resources being made available to them in the most efficient and effective manner to ensure high visibility policing in our communities.</p><p>It is also important to note that overtime cannot be considered in isolation from the other resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  For example 2018 will see recruitment of a further 800 Garda recruits, while 800 recruits will also graduate from Templemore during the year.  Provision has also been made for significant civilian recruitment (2,000 additional civilians by 2021) and for a doubling of the Reserve to 2,000 by 2021.  These measures are providing additional policing hours throughout the country, both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of significant numbers of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties consequential on the increased civilianisation of the organisation.  This unprecedented level of investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including in recruitment, is therefore expected, over a period of time, to have a positive impact on the overtime budget.</p><p>This<b></b>underlines this Government&rsquo;s commitment to reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that will enhance the operation of policing in Ireland in ways that are positive for both members of the public and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

In addition, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can also use the on call doctor service when dealing with such incidents.</p>  <p>  Further, section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which provides for Garda powers to take persons believed to be suffering from a mental disorder into custody, may be invoked by the Garda&iacute; where they come into contact with a mentally ill person in a crisis situation.  In such situations, it may appear that the person is a danger to himself/herself or to others.  Section 12 may be invoked to ensure that a medical assessment and admission to an approved centre and treatment in accordance with that Act are accessed.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum of Understanding between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE has been developed in order to provide an appropriate response in respect of the removal or return of persons to approved centres in accordance with the Mental Health Act 2001.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE are the key agencies empowered by law to carry out these functions.  Mutual understanding and cooperation is essential in ensuring that these roles are carried out effectively.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that during Phase 1 of the Applied Policing Programme, Trainee Garda&iacute; are exposed to and challenged with the issues surrounding vulnerable persons suffering from mental illness.</p>  <p>  The training programme is delivered using a problem based learning approach (PBL) and includes a module on Policing with the Communities.  As part of this module under Unit 5 - Mental Illness Awareness, trainees focus on the area of the elderly and mental illness and look at areas such as types of mental illness, Garda powers and procedures and transportation of persons with a medical illness.  It also contains information on the various community and social services involved in the area.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that in addition to this and as part of the BA programme, the trainees attend a 2 day internationally recognised ASIST suicide prevention programme which is co-delivered with the HSE.  The ASIST programme is a suicide first aid programme which equips students with the skills required to discuss suicide with a person at risk and to make an intervention to reduce the immediate risk of suicide.</p>  <p>  In April 2014 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Continuous Professional Development Core Programme for operational members, provided training on Mental Illness Awareness in keeping with the Mental Health Act 2001.  The programme also covered areas of the types of mental illness, Garda powers and procedures and transportation of persons with a mental illness.  This topic will be included in the Core Programme for 2018.</p>  <p>  The vulnerability of suspects, witnesses and injured parties is also embedded in all training courses for Investigative Interviewing with Level 3 Investigative Interviewing addressing the area of memory through the use of enhanced cognitive interview skills.  The areas of personality disorders and mental health are also covered on these training courses.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  Further, it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Louth Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available, was 312, of whom 4 were allocated to the Divisional Drug Unit.  There are also 23 Garda Reserves and 31 Garda civilian staff attached to the Louth Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences, crime or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  In 2015 the Commissioner established a new national Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GDOCB), which brought together the Organised Crime Unit and the Garda National Drug Unit so as to create a robust entity to effectively tackle drugs and organised crime, as it currently exists in this country.</p>  <p>  The GDOCB leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies.  In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level.  This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  I am informed that this approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.</p>  <p>  We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures.</p>  <p>  Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources he needs to allow him to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation including the Divisional Drugs Units.</p></reply>

The case concerned an appeal taken by the State against a judgment of the High Court ordering the release of the three named prisoners who had been transferred to Ireland from the UK under the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Acts 1995 -1997.  The judgment is detailed and has complex implications for the process of transferring prisoners from other States, and in particular the UK, to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The principal issue in the judgment is the significantly different sentencing systems which operate in the UK and in this State.  In particular, the judgment raises the issue of how best to adapt and administer under Irish law a foreign sentence, which contains features not found in Irish sentences.  This is important, as it is not possible to operate a prisoner transfer system where there is uncertainty on the part of either the transferring or receiving State as to the length of sentence to be served by the prisoner concerned.</p>  <p>  The complex legal and administrative implications of this judgment are being examined by my Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office.  Detailed legal advice has been received, and an amendment of the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Acts will be required.  Work is under way on drafting that amendment, and I will bring a proposal to Government as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that all the applicants and officials in the appropriate sentencing states have been informed of the situation.</p></reply>

In 2008, the IPS established a dedicated team of officers who have sole responsibility for preventing the flow of contraband into prisons.  The Operational Support Group (OSG) operate the security screening areas that are now located at the point of entry of all closed prisons.  They also operate the canine unit and the Operational Support Unit who conduct regular searches and gather intelligence in relation to the smuggling of contraband.</p><p>I am further advised that efforts are made on a continuous basis by prison staff to prevent the flow of drugs into our prisons.  In addition to the establishment of the OSG, the installation of nets over exercise yards, enhanced CCTV monitoring, the stricter control of visits and the use of targeted and random cell searches on a daily basis has reduced the availability of contraband.  The introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines has also helped efforts to tackle the problem.  Random searches of cells and their occupants have uncovered significant quantities of contraband in recent years.</p><p>Nevertheless, the IPS recognises that constant improvements are required in this area and have introduced a free confidential telephone line (1800 855 717) which is now operational.  Prisoners, visitors, staff or members of the public with information on the trafficking of prohibited items into our prisons can pass on that information in the strictest confidence.</p><p>The following table highlights the different type of contraband confiscated by the IPS.  I hope the Deputy finds this information useful.</p><p><b>Contraband Seizures Statistics for 2011-2017</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Phones</th><th>Drugs</th><th>Weapons</th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>872</td><td>1018</td><td>557</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>648</td><td>715</td><td>435</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>626</td><td>808</td><td>564</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>728</td><td>986</td><td>648</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>805</td><td>1019</td><td>914</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1150</td><td>1256</td><td>1141</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1368</td><td>1417</td><td>1288</td></tr></table>* The number of mobile phone seized in the Midlands for 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018 is 89, 123 and 66 (up to 26/05/18) respectively.</p></reply>

As Commissioner, Mr Harris will have the full functions of that role including safeguarding the security of the State.  On taking up office in September he will, like all entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, make a solemn declaration under section 16 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the State.  He will also sign the Garda Code of Ethics.</p><p>This is the first occasion that the independent Policing Authority has exercised its function in relation to the filling of this important position.  I thank the Authority and the Public Appointments Service for their intensive work over the past ten months on this process.  The selection process was an open, international one, designed with the objective of attracting the<b></b>widest possible pool of candidates from diverse backgrounds to ensure that the successful candidate would be tested against international standards in police leadership.<b></b>I understand it worked well in attracting a strong field of high calibre candidates.  All those who put themselves forward were subject to robust scrutiny by an independent expert interview board which determined Mr Harris to be the best person for the office at this time.</p><p>The incoming Commissioner is a person of huge ability and the highest integrity and I know he has enormous respect for and knowledge of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, having worked with members of the organisation as close colleagues over the course of his career.</p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that dealing with the legacy of the troubles on this island is a complex and sensitive task, and one to which there are no easy solutions.</p><p>The Government, working with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland, agreed a framework of measures in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement to seek to address this legacy and we are fully committed to seeing those measures put in place and working in the interests of victims and their families.</p><p>The political impasse at the Northern Ireland Executive has delayed the roll out of these measures and the Government will continue to work hard to seek the re-establishment of the Executive for the benefit of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p><p>Under the leadership of the incoming Commissioner, the Garda Authorities will continue to co-operate fully with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of all relevant criminal investigations, whether contemporary or historical, in accordance with the arrangements in place.  There is also ongoing co-operation with Coroner&rsquo;s inquests in Northern Ireland and the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland in respect of historical investigations.</p><p>With regard to unresolved, troubles-related criminal investigations in this jurisdiction, the Garda Authorities will fully pursue any new evidence or information that comes to light with a view to bringing the perpetrators of crimes to justice.  There are also regular reviews of cases where it is considered that there may be grounds to advance those investigations.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R.) West Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 671. There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 55 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  The number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the D.M.R. North Central Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 643.  There are also 35 Garda Reserves and 42 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide of whom 194 and 181 respectively were assigned to the D.M.R. West Division and the D.M.R. North Central Division. Garda<b></b>numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the D.M.R. West Division and the D.M.R. North Central Division. </p></reply>

In accordance with section 13(9) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969, it is open to either party to the dispute to appeal the recommendation to the Labour Court.   </p>  <p>  However, I should point out that Ireland&rsquo;s system of Industrial Relations is essentially voluntary in nature and therefore under the Industrial Relations Acts, recommendations of a Rights Commissioner, or a decision of the Labour Court on appeal, if this was sought, are not binding on the parties involved.</p>  <p>  It follows that there is no statutory mechanism for the enforcement of such recommendations under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2015 although there is an expectation that the parties to the dispute would respect the process put in place by the State to resolve disputes in the workplace.

The review is on schedule for completion with a full report due in the coming weeks.  Following on from that Report, it is expected that a review of the lists of occupations for employment permits will be conducted in the second half of this year.   </p>  <p>  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and wider EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.  The employment permits system is managed in part through the operation of the highly skilled and ineligible occupation lists for the purpose of grant of employment permits.  </p>  <p>  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs and, coordinated by the National Skills Council, the annual National Skills Bulletin and the annual Vacancy Overview Report in tandem with a public consultation process.  </p>  <p>  Care workers are currently included on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL).   In order to remove a skill from this list, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed evidence-based case for removal of care workers from the ineligible list, based on this detailed data would then need to be put forward by the Department of Health, as the lead Department for the sector, to my Department for review and consideration. </p>  <p>  I am aware that my colleague, Minister of State Daly, with special responsibility for Older People, has had various meetings with the nursing home sector and this matter has been discussed.  I understand Minister Daly is willing to work with the industry on this important issue to ensure continuity of service in the best interests of residents.    </p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. NIAC has made a recommendation that the HPV vaccine should be given to boys.  </p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority is undertaking a health technology assessment, at the request of my Department, on extending the national immunisation schedule to include HPV vaccination to boys.  This HTA will establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of providing the vaccine to boys and is expected in Q4 2018. The decision to extend the current programme which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second-level education to a programme that also offers vaccination to boys will be informed by the evidence contained in the HTA.</p>  <p>  The process to enable an informed decision concerning the extension of the current HPV immunisation programme is at an advanced stage. Once it is concluded, and subject to a favourable recommendation from HTA, I will seek to extend this vaccine universally as a priority.</p></reply>

The introduction of legislation in relation to AHR and associated research is a priority for me and officials in my Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the process of drafting this Bill. The General Scheme is published on my Department&rsquo;s website and the Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of this year.</p>  <p>  In order to support the commencement of the legislation, officials in my Department are working  with the HSE over the course of this year in developing a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p>  <p>  Part of this work includes identifying policy options for a public funding model for AHR treatment. Once I have had the opportunity to consider these policy options I will bring a Memorandum to Government in relation to a model of care for infertility, including public funding for AHR treatment, for the Government's consideration.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that any funding model that may ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework set out in the AHR Bill and a model of care for infertility.</p>  <p>  While IVF treatment is not currently provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. In addition to these schemes, there is a limited specialist AHR service available through the HSE, which provides funding for fertility preservation for cancer patients whose treatment is likely to impact on their future fertility.</p></reply>

Over the past two years, I and officials have been engaging with a number of voluntary EU forums including the Roundtable meetings with EU Health Ministers and the pharmaceutical industry, High Level Pharmaceutical Policy Meetings and the Valletta Technical Committee in an effort to identifying solutions to issues of medicine pricing, sustainability and supply.</p>  <p>  On the 22 June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy to work with Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.</p>  <p>  The Beneluxa collaboration was established in 2015, with a view to taking a collective approach to pharmaceutical procurement and evaluation. This Initiative seeks to enhance patients' access to high quality and affordable treatments, improve the payers' position in the market through joint negotiations, increase transparency on pricing between the collaborating countries, share policy expertise and focus on knowledge building.  </p>  <p>  This Initiative is well established, with clear goals and a pragmatic approach to delivering on its objectives.  Four areas of collaboration has been identified: horizon scanning, health technology assessment, information sharing and policy exchange and joint price negotiations.  </p>  <p>  The Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy will have an important role to play in securing faster access to innovative medicines and provide important platforms in which to strengthen the policy mix and deliver on the shared objective of securing access to high cost, innovative treatments at affordable prices. The patients is at the centre of this collaborative international approach.</p>  <p>  Members of the Beneluxa Initiative will work closely together to identify pragmatic solutions to the challenges which we all now face with medicine pricing, sustainability and supply.</p></reply>

Funding has been provided to support extension of the existing cath lab operating hours to 12 weekly sessions per week, or by 20%, as recommended in the Herity Report. </p>  <p>  Approval and funding has been provided for the posts required to facilitate this service expansion and recruitment is currently being progressed by local management and the HSE&rsquo;s National Recruitment Service.  A mobile cath lab has been deployed since October 2017, initially for a period of 20 weeks but since extended to allow time for University Hospital Waterford to complete recruitment of the additional staff required for the service extension to the existing cath lab.</p>  <p>  The Herity report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services should cease to allow the hospital focus on the much larger volume of planned work.  I asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.  The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.  As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac catheterisation laboratories and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review, which is expected to be complete by June 2019. </p>  <p>  When I met with South East Oireachtas members on 14 February last, I indicated that I would give some consideration to the various issues raised by the group, including the potential for the deployment of a modular cath lab, as an interim solution, pending the outcome of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.  I requested my Department to examine the matter in conjunction with the HSE.  I have now considered a submission from my Department on the matter.  I believe there is merit in the proposal for a modular cardiac cath lab at UHW, and I have requested my Department to proceed without delay to engage with the HSE on the necessary next steps, as I set out in an email to the Deputy yesterday.</p></reply>

It commenced its investigations in May 2017 and its work is ongoing. The Commission was established to investigate the care and protection of "Grace" (pseudonym) and other in a former foster home in the South East, which has been the subject of abuse allegations. The first phase of the Commission's work is to investigate the role of public authorities in the care and protection of Grace, who resided with a former foster family in the South East of Ireland between 1989 and 2009. Under the Commission's Terms of Reference a final report on the Commission's phase 1 work was due to be submitted to the Minister for Health within one year of the Commission commencing its work, i.e., 15th May 2018.</p>  <p>  The Sole Member of the Commission, Marjorie Farrelly, S.C, wrote to Minister Harris on 27 April 2018 seeking a 12 month extension to allow the Commission to complete its phase 1 investigations and prepare its report on this. The request for an extension was on the basis of the enormous volume of documentation disclosed to it from a wide range of public bodies, organisations and individuals and also the number of potential witnesses involved.</p>  <p>  The Minister granted the Commission's request for a 12 month extension to complete its phase 1 investigations on 15 May 2018. In doing this the Minister specified that the Commission must submit a minimum of two interim reports by 15 September 2018 and 15 January 2019 setting out its progress and including a summary of work left to complete.</p>  <p>  As required by its term of reference, the Commission presented its first interim report to the Department of Health on 15 November 2017. A second interim report was enclosed with the Commission's application for a time extension on 27 April 2018. Both of these interim reports are available on the Department's website. </p></reply>

In this new classification, "gender incongruence" is now categorised under conditions related to sexual health, instead of mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders. </p>  <p>  WHO said gender incongruence "is characterized by a marked and persistent incongruence between an individual's experienced gender and the assigned sex". The rationale for the new classification is that while evidence is now clear that it is not a mental disorder, and indeed classifying it in this can cause enormous stigma for people who are transgender, there remain significant health care needs that can best be met if the condition is coded under the ICD.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the ICD-11 will be presented to the World Health Assembly, in 2019, for adoption by countries. It will come into effect in 2022. The advance preview will allow countries to plan how to use the new version and to train health professionals</p>  <p>  The Department's National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020, developed under Healthy Ireland, is a strategic framework for the sexual health and wellbeing of the Irish population. The vision is that everyone experiences positive sexual health and wellbeing, and has access to high quality sexual health information, education and services. The strategy takes a life course approach to sexual health which acknowledges the importance of developing healthy sexuality throughout childhood and adolescence and builds on that foundation for positive sexual health and wellbeing into adulthood and older age. The three goals key goals of the strategy are:</p>  <p>  - To ensure that everyone has access to appropriate sexual health education and information;</p>  <p>  - To ensure that high quality sexual health services are available and affordable;</p>  <p>  - Ensure that good quality data is available to guide the service.</p>  <p>  I welcome this new classification of transgender as a sexual health condition as one that can best meet the health care needs of transgender people.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.  If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP.  Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  In relation to information on a specific appeal, the patient's clinician should contact the MMP directly.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE and you will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Where a service is provided in Ireland but a patient wishes to access care in another EU/EEA Member State, this can be possible by seeking treatment under the Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare, otherwise known as the Cross Border Directive (CBD).</p>  <p>  The HSE operates the CBD in Ireland. Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians.  In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the CBD on its website which can be accessed at: hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/ and also by phone at 056 7784551.  The HSE advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorization before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP.</p>  <p>  The HSE also operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) for persons entitled to treatment in another EU/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation (EC) No. 883/2004, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations (EC) No. 987/2009.  The TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE) where the treatment is:</p>  <p>  - Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation;</p>  <p>  - Not available in Ireland; and</p>  <p>  - Not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease.</p>  <p>  GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS.  The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend.</p>  <p>  Applications to the TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment.  The statutory framework stipulates the patient must be a public patient and is required to have followed public patient pathways.

The Control of Horses Act 1996 details powers available to local authorities for the control and welfare of horses.  Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister for Agriculture, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may make grants towards the expenses of a local authority incurred under the Act.  In this regard my Department provided funding of &euro;533,839 to local authorities in 2017 to assist with their work in control of stray and abandoned horses.</p>  <p>  In addition to funding from Central Government such as the above and funding received from the Local Government Fund, local authorities receive the money from dog licensing to directly sub vent the work of their dog wardens.</p>  <p>  Animal cruelty is a matter that is dealt with by a wider range of organisations, in particular my department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and authorised officers of the ISPCA and DSPCA.  The latter are some of the many recipients of the considerable ex-gratia funding which my department provides to underpin important work done by many organisations in the area of supporting animal welfare.  I announced in December 2017 the largest ever Department allocation of funding to animal welfare organisations of &euro;2,560,000.  A total of 111 organisations will benefit under these arrangements.</p>  <p>  My Department has also taken a proactive approach to reducing problems in the horse area by developing facilities for urban and traveller horse populations and in educating young people among these communities in the care and welfare of horses.  Again this work is done in close collaboration with local authorities involved.</p></reply>

These include: </p>  <p>  - The longevity and sustainability of these reductions in the longer term.  For example, feeding trials for similarly promising substances in the past have shown that the emissions reducing effect fades over time as the microbes in the rumen adjust to the new additive. </p>  <p>  - The impact on animal performance/animal health and effect on the livestock products (milk and meat).  For example, is there a risk of residues in produce? </p>  <p>  - The quantities of seaweed required (even at 2%, the area harvestable required per annum would be substantial).  Moreover, the red algae in question is not found in Ireland so may need to be imported or a suitable indigenous alternative identified.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor the situation ensuring that any Irish research that might be undertaken in the future is customised to addressing the particulars of the Irish livestock production system.</p></reply>

The ability to identify and trace animals is critical from an animal health, food safety and animal welfare perspective.  The current system was introduced in 2010.  The system is complex, with multiple and different scenarios associated with the movement/trading of sheep &ndash; necessitating a 44 page Step by Step Guide published by the Department.  The current system necessitates the manual transcription of a series of individual lengthy tag numbers at each point of transaction along the supply chain &ndash; which provides significant ongoing challenge in the context of an effective traceability system. </p>  <p>  The main benefits of the new arrangements can be summarised as relating to reduced complexity associated with tag types and retagging of animals, readable and accurate records, and reduced administrative burden for farmers.  It will critically improve industry and the State's capacity to effectively respond &ndash; in a timely, targeted, focused and accurate way - to critical animal health and food safety incidents/events.  It also facilitates DAFM, acting on behalf of the industry, in engaging more proactively in seeking and achieving new market access for Irish sheep and sheep meat products.  </p>  <p>  Hence, the new rules will provide a more robust sheep traceability system and will further support the development and sustainability of the sheep industry as detailed in the Food Wise 2025 Strategy.  </p>  <p>  I accept that additional costs will accrue to farmers in extending EID to all sheep.  In that context I announced the introduction of a one off support measure up to a maximum of &euro;50 per keeper for the first purchase of EID tags.  Electronic tag readers and associated software are included as eligible investments in the Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) scheme to assist sheep farmers in flock management.  </p>  <p>  My officials and I have met with a number of the stakeholders in the sheep industry since I announced the new rules on 2 May.  A number of submissions have also been made on the matter.  I am currently considering the views expressed by all parties and will make a further statement when I have completed these deliberations.</p></reply>

There are three options to complete the Green Cert; (1) on a fulltime basis in the Teagasc Agricultural Colleges which is most suitable for school leavers, (2) on a part-time basis in the Agricultural Colleges and Teagasc advisory regions where applicants are over 23 years of age, and (3) on a distance education basis in respect of applicants who have obtained a Level 6 or higher major award in a non-agricultural discipline. </p>  <p>  The provision of places for the Green Cert is an operational matter for Teagasc.  It is Teagasc policy to accommodate all farmers that require a place.  I understand from Teagasc that it expects to accommodate all applicants to its fulltime Green Cert in the Agricultural Colleges for the 2018/2019 academic year.  Teagasc further advise that the adult Green Cert Programme comprising part-time and distance education options is offered on a rolling basis at circa 30 locations.  From a resource and logistical perspective, there is normally a waiting period for the adult Green Cert to allow for completion of course cycles and new courses to commence. </p>  <p>  Interest has been exceptionally high in the adult Green Cert Programme in recent years due to the education requirements for some Department schemes and reflecting renewed interest in farming among young farmers.  My Department approved the appointment of over 60 temporary staff to maximise participation enabling Teagasc to substantially increase Green Cert intake to over 4,000 since 2015.</p></reply>

Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 on summary conviction and-or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.​​</p>  <p>  There have been instances of individuals jailed for offences committed under the Waste Management Act and in 2015 the Environmental Protection Agency secured a record &euro;20 million fine against a company for causing pollution at a former landfill in County Kildare. </p>  <p>  My Department has previously issued a policy direction to local authorities which remains in force, instructing them to pursue illegal holders of waste in accordance with the maximum potential sanctions available under the law in order to maximise the deterrent factor and aim to eliminate the economic benefit deriving from such illegal activity. </p>  <p>  At the recent launch of the anti-dumping awareness campaign for Connacht-Ulster, I stated that current financial penalties for littering were being increased from &euro;150 to &euro;250 and that legislation needed to be strengthened to deal with repeat offenders.  I also highlighted a pilot project currently running in Sligo County Council, where the local authority is requesting customer Eircodes from waste collectors to ensure that people are disposing of their waste responsibly. It is my intention that this project would be rolled out nationally in due course and would be supported by necessary bye-laws requiring householders to retain their receipts as proof of how they are disposing of their waste.  </p></reply>

My Department works closely to support and assist local authorities in tackling difficult enforcement challenges, alleviating environmental risk and prosecuting cases in the appropriate courts.</p>  <p>  Issues concerning the enforcement of waste legislation are statutory matters for local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency as appropriate, which both have significant powers under waste regulations to secure compliance from waste operators.  The role of my Department is to provide a comprehensive legislative and policy framework through which the enforcement authorities operate. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, State intervention and support has been required and continues to be required for the remediation of sites where for a variety of reasons the parties responsible for the illegal dumping cannot be readily pursued and where the polluter pays principle cannot be applied.  It remains a matter of policy that where the competent authorities concerned under waste legislation are obliged to step in and secure the protection of human health and the environment, my Department will support the authorities concerned in this task and an allocation of &euro;11 million has been made available to support the remediation of historic or unauthorised landfill sites across the State this year. </p>  <p>  I describe illegal dumping as economic and environmental treason.  That is why I asked my officials to develop the anti-dumping initiative to target those who are responsible for the unauthorised movement and disposal of waste and to reduce incidents of illegal dumping nationally.  This is being achieved by providing funding for projects tackling the problem including the provision of support for monitoring and surveillance, both covert and overt, of dumping black-spots and the development of an integrated and effective approach to dealing with this issue using a collaborative approach with local authorities, communities and other State Agencies. By the end of this year over 400 anti-dumping projects will have been completed nationwide supported by funding of &euro;3.3 million from my Department.</p></reply>

Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address and eircode.</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017 and available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  This process is now in its final stages. </p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

No decision has yet been reached on specific funding levels for future years. Benefit-in-kind comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  The National Policy Framework: Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017 to 2030 sets out the need for electric vehicle charging in Ireland. Although the existing capacity of the public charging network is considered adequate, development of infrastructure to meet the growing demand is necessary.</p>  <p>  A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network. The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focuses on electric vehicles, is nearing completion and I expect to bring forward proposals that will support the provision of effective and efficient publically accessible electric vehicle charging later this year.</p>  <p>  Funding for public charging in local communities is already available through the Better Energy Communities Scheme.  The scheme, which is administered by the SEAI, supports community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area.  </p>  <p>  To support home charging, where the majority of electric vehicle charging takes place, I introduced the Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant this year.  This supports the cost of installing a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600 for buyers of both new and second-hand electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  As part of the  Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the lead department in relation to planning legislation and building regulations. In addition, the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive was recently finalised at European Union level. This Directive sets out requirements for the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in new residential and non-residential buildings with more than ten parking spaces and such buildings undergoing major renovation.  The Directive also requires Member States to lay down requirements for the installation of a minimum number of recharging points for all non-residential buildings with more than twenty parking spaces from 2025. Furthermore, the Directive requires that Member States provide for measures in order to simplify the deployment of recharging points in new and existing residential and non-residential buildings. The transposition of this Directive into Irish law will be led by my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  </p>  <p>  Currently, my Department has one electric vehicle charging point with a designated parking place at its offices Adelaide Road in Dublin. It is planned to increase this number to three charging points with accompanying designated parking places. The position at my Department's office locations will be kept under review in the light of growing demand.</p></reply>

Furthermore, micro generation will be required given the scale of our climate and energy ambition as laid out in the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2040. My Department already supports the deployment of Solar PV through the SEAI led Better Energy Communities and  Deep Retrofit pilot schemes.</p>  <p>  Last year, my Department assessed micro generation, across a number of renewable electricity generating technologies (including solar PV), as part of the economic analysis to underpin the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The assessment identified technical and financial challenges which may need to be addressed before a broader support scheme for micro generation can be introduced. This is in line with international experience, including across the EU, where many member states who have introduced supports for micro generation have had to reform them or cancel them altogether. </p>  <p>  The reality is that bringing micro generation on to a system designed for large generators is complicated. It impacts how we pay for the network, how we manage regulation and how we technically manage the system. My Department is continuing to work closely with the micro generation sector and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner. </p>  <p>  Solar PV and self-consumption among domestic customers will be supported under a pilot scheme to promote micro generation, due to be launched this summer. It is important that before a scheme like this is introduced, the likely demand for the scheme is understood and the SEAI are currently assessing the results of a study that examined this aspect. It is equally important that safety, technical and training requirements are established in advance of this pilot scheme being rolled out and the SEAI are developing a micro generation Code of Practice which will underpin the pilot scheme.</p>  <p>  The data gathered during the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro generation in Ireland that may be appropriate, as we align with the ambition of the recast Renewable Energy Directive which recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers. This pilot scheme will deliver on ambitions and commitments made in the Energy White Paper and the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

These aspects covered issues of concern from the origins of the project in 2009 to the present day. I listened carefully to the many views expressed and I undertook to further consider the issues raised.</p>  <p>  The Laois-Kilkenny electricity project is to improve the security of electricity supply across counties Kilkenny, Carlow, Kildare and Laois. It is a &euro;110 million investment in the area designed to ensure that the electricity network can meet the present and future needs of all users, from homes to farms and small businesses to industrial customers.

The report is available on the GSI website www.gsi.ie under the CCS section. The study found that while well data are generally favourable, the basins studied are structurally complex, with a lot of faulting that compartmentalises potential reservoir units and no obvious large storage site was identified. The study indicated that there is scope to extend this study to other basins that might be more favourable, particularly in the south Celtic Sea. </p><p>As outlined in the National Mitigation Plan, a watching brief is being maintained on this developing technology and related research and further studies will be carried out as appropriate.</p><p>Officials in my Department have met with Ervia, the parent company of Gas Networks Ireland, to discuss the potential for CCS in Ireland in particular in respect of the Kinsale gas fields, which are coming to the end of their productive life and will commence decommissioning in the next few years.</p></reply>

Our commercial ports, however, differ greatly in size, capability and future potential.  The long-term international trend in ports and shipping is toward increased consolidation of resources in order to achieve optimum efficiencies of scale.  Therefore the core objective of National Ports Policy (NPP) is to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services.  National Ports Policy introduces a clear categorisation of the ports based on tonnage and the clear potential to provide future port capacity.  </p>  <p>  It is already evident that larger vessels requiring greater depths are becoming the norm, necessitating greater investment in ports.  There is no Exchequer funding available for infrastructural development but the Ports of National Significance (Tier 1) are required to lead the response to future national port capacity requirements, as the development of large scale port infrastructure requires significant organizational, operational and financial resources.  There is also a role in this regard for the Ports of National Significance (Tier 2) to develop additional capacity to aid competitive conditions, within the unitised sectors in particular.  </p>  <p>  National Ports Policy provides that the Ports of Regional Significance retain important roles as facilitators of their regional economies and, in some instances, as centres of marine-related amenity and tourism activities.  </p>  <p>  Similarly at a European level the planning, development and operation of trans-European transport networks (TEN-T) contribute to the attainment of major EU objectives, including contributing to further economic growth and competitiveness in a global perspective as set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Commission White Paper entitled "Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area &ndash; Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system" ("the White Paper").  TEN-T aims to develop a Europe-wide network of roads, railway lines, inland waterways, maritime shipping routes, ports, airports and rail-road terminals in a resource-efficient and sustainable way.  </p>  <p>  The Tier 1 and Tier 2 Ports of National Significance are currently included on the TEN-T network, as they meet the necessary criteria under Regulation (EU) 1315/2013.  The criteria to qualify for inclusion as a TEN-T Port are outlined in Article 20(2) of EU Regulation No. 1315/2013. These criteria were set at a European level.  </p></reply>

These five ports retain important roles as facilitators of their regional economies and, in some instances, as centres of marine-related amenity and tourism activities.  However, the scale and nature of these activities are not such as to warrant continued central Government involvement.  </p>  <p>  The Harbours Act 2015 provides the necessary legislative framework to allow for the transfer of the Ports of Regional Significance to local authority control.  The local authorities concerned have commenced a due diligence process with the ports due to be transferred. </p>  <p>  Two ports have already transferred to local authority control.  The first of these was Wicklow Port Company which was transferred directly under the control of Wicklow County Council on 30 August 2016.  On that date, the company was dissolved and its assets, liabilities and employees were transferred into the Council.  The transfer of Drogheda Port Company to Louth County Council took place on 2 October 2017 and involved a transfer of shareholding retaining the limited company structure.  </p>  <p>  Work on the transfers of the three remaining ports is progressing well.

Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.  </p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest.  The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port;  however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.  </p>  <p>  Following that assessment, my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.  That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by my Department.  </p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, which operates Rosslare Europort, is itself a subsidiary of CI&Eacute;.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann manages the port as one of its divisions. Rosslare Europort operates profitably and generated revenue of &euro;10.6 million in 2017.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised that it has completed a commercial review of Rosslare Europort and will now prepare a business plan, to include consideration of the implications of Brexit for the port.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), in conjunction with my Department, has been undertaking a study into the use of the UK landbridge by Irish importers and exporters.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this research is to establish the volume of traffic using the UK landbridge at present, the likely consequences that Brexit will have on landbridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable.  </p>  <p>  This piece of research is being finalised, is expected to be completed shortly and should inform the potential for the future utilisation of all ports, including Rosslare Europort.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that I recently visited Rosslare Europort at the invitation of Minister of State Paul Kehoe and was briefed by the Europort&rsquo;s management on the port&rsquo;s commercial position.  </p>  <p>  This was a particularly valuable opportunity for me as Minister to witness the central role that Rosslare Europort plays within the economy of Wexford, and indeed the wider south-east, and to see at first hand its potential in terms of future development as a vital part of our country&rsquo;s trading infrastructure.  I am satisfied that Rosslare Europort, as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, is effectively managing operations at the port and looking to the potential of the port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities.  </p></reply>

In addition the Corridor will also benefit from investments planned under other National Strategic Outcomes such as 'Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities' and 'High-Quality International Connectivity'.  </p><p>A number of these investments fall within the remit of my Department and its agencies as detailed below - </p><p><b><i>Roads</i></b></p><p>The Atlantic Corridor roads project is based on National roads.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Noting this, I have referred this aspect of the Deputy&rsquo;s question to TII for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days<i>.</i></p><p><b><i>Rail</i></b></p><p>Building on the recommendations in the recent Public Investment Management Assessment study and the findings set out in the Rail Review 2016, a continuing key priority for investment in transport under the NDP is to protect the quality of and the investment already made in the existing national rail system, by funding projects that support and maintain safety and service levels in railway operations.  </p><p>It is also a core priority under the NPF to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban centres of population and their regions, in parallel with the initiation of compact growth of urban centres.  Similarly, a major objective under the NDP, is to make substantial progress in linking our regions and urban areas not just to Dublin but to each other.  The NDP also recognises that over the period of the Plan it will be very important to examine the role inter-urban rail network can play in enhancing regional connectivity.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware both the &lsquo;Programme for a Partnership Government&rsquo; and the NDP commit to an independent review of the costings for a proposal to extend the existing Western Rail Corridor beyond Athenry in County Galway.  In this regard my Department is currently at an advanced stage in developing an approach for progressing such a review in line with these commitments, and I expect to be in a position shortly to decide on the approach to be taken.  I am cognisant of the need for stakeholder consultation as part of the process and can assure the Deputy that this will be an integral part of the review's arrangements.  </p><p><b><i>Ports</i></b></p><p>Shannon Foynes Port Company&rsquo;s Infrastructure Development Programme as outlined in their Master Plan Vision 2041 is well underway. Shannon Foynes Port Company will be investing &euro;27m in the development.  The development will be funded through the Company&rsquo;s own resources, loan financing and EU grant funding.</p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.  </p>  <p>  I am concerned, however, to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to ensure the safety and security of passengers and staff travelling and working on our rail network.  </p>  <p>  There were 45.5 million passenger journeys in 2017 on Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the vast majority of which occurred without incident.  </p>  <p>  However, I have been advised by the company that the number of recorded anti-social incidents has risen in the last number of years.  In 2016, 492 incidents were recorded, of which 12 were assaults on staff. In 2017, 705 incidents were recorded, of which 15 were assaults on staff.  To date this year, 305 incidents have been recorded, of which 5 were assaults on staff.  </p>  <p>  The safety and security of passengers and staff including arrangements to deal with anti-social behaviour on the DART is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in conjunction with, as appropriate, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised that it liaises on a minimum quarterly basis with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in major districts to address trends and issues on an area basis.  In addition, this allows for proactive planning for events and known recurring issues.  </p>  <p>  Security patrols by the company have increased by 21.8% since 2016 and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised that it has enhanced general security cover and provides for enhanced security patrols for major events.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in view of concerns raised by trades unions regarding security on certain routes in Dublin, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has committed to a number of immediate and short-term measures to maintain a safe travelling environment for customers and staff and to ensure service continuity.  Any curtailment of DART services would be a matter for the company in conjunction with the National Transport Authority.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to advise that my Department has written to the CEO of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the Chairman of the Railway Safety Advisory Council to seek their views on the adequacy of the current arrangements for combatting anti-social behaviour on our rail network.  I have also asked my Department to engage with the CEO&rsquo;s of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to seek their views on the adequacy of the current arrangements for combatting anti-social behaviour on our buses.  When I have received and considered their responses, I intend to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about ensuring the safety of all passengers and staff on our public transport systems.  </p></reply>

The methodology for how these costs were estimated is described in detail in Appendix B of that report, which is available on my Department's website. For ease of reference, I include a link here:</p><p><i></i>.  </p><p>The report focuses specifically on the direct impact, in terms of the monetary cost of increased travel time, on road users in the GDA.  It does not, therefore, estimate the impacts of congestion on pollution or collision rates.  However, as referenced in the report, the cost of congestion study carried out by New Zealand Transport Authority estimated that the value of time impact accounted for 92.5% of the total cost, which included emissions and environmental costs, vehicle operating costs and indirect costs such as schedule delay costs.  </p><p>Using this rule of thumb, the 2013 costs of congestion would rise from &euro;358m to &euro;387m, and the 2033 costs would rise from &euro;2.08bn to &euro;2.25bn. It is worth noting that this would still not account for collision rates.  </p><p>There isn't definitive evidence on the impact of congestion on collision rates.  On the one hand, increased traffic can lead to increased numbers of incidents. but, conversely, congestion reduces speeds which can reduce the likelihood and severity of collisions. </p><p>In 2015 my Department published the Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport,<i></i>which identified addressing urban congestion as one of three key priorities for future investment.  The cost of congestion report is a valuable piece of evidence on the extent of the problem in one city region, and it is planned to extend this analysis to Ireland's other cities, in collaboration with the National Transport Authority and its regional modelling system.  </p></reply>

The decision on the most appropriate lower-emitting fuels and technologies for the Irish context will rest with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and work is already underway on preparing for implementation. </p><p>In tandem, an up-to-date and comprehensive set of vehicle trials is being planned to commence later this year to help further inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years. The technologies likely to be tested include full electrification, diesel-electric hybrids, and compressed natural gas; it is expected that the vehicles will be tested in both the GDA and in a regional city. The trials are likely to consider CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, air quality impacts, and contribution potential towards renewable energy targets as well as costs, vehicle availability, and operational/infrastructural requirements. </p><p>My Department is working together with the NTA and key urban transport operators (Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann) to develop and coordinate these trials, which are planned to commence before the end of this year. The cost of the trials is yet to be determined but it is expected that demonstration vehicles will be procured to conduct trials in test conditions without purchase costs being incurred. The majority of costs are expected to arise from the on-board assessment of real world emissions by independent consultants.</p><p>Noting its responsibility with regards to this matter, I have referred your questions to the NTA for consideration and direct reply.

Converting the public transport bus fleets to low-carbon alternatives would have a very limited mitigation impact on Ireland's overall CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions profile and on our emissions targets for 2020. However, transitioning the national bus fleet away from fossil fuels is nonetheless an important measure to allow Government to show leadership in this area, which will normalise and promote the uptake by the public of alternative fuels and technologies. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, under the National Development Plan (2018) we have committed that, from July 2019 onwards, we will no longer buy diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet; and work is already underway on preparing for implementation of this.  </p><p>Given the limited CO<sub>2</sub>mitigation potential of converting the bus fleet to alternative fuels/technologies the influence of pollutants on air quality has been considered significant. In recent years all new diesel bus purchases in Ireland have been required to meet the Euro VI engine emissions standard, which regulates the amount of dangerous pollutants such as NO<sub>x</sub>and particulate matter (PM) that is permitted from diesel engines. These cleaner Euro VI buses represented a very significant improvement in emission reductions when compared with the older vehicles that they replaced and had significant co-benefits for our air quality. Efforts to &lsquo;green&rsquo; the fleet will continue and undoubtedly older, more polluting buses will be the first to be replaced with lower-emission vehicles.</p><p>Noting its responsibility with regards to this matter, I have referred the Deputy's queries to the NTA for consideration and direct reply.

The early years work force deserve to be recognised, valued and respected. My Department does, however, acknowledge that pay and conditions are major issues facing the sector. I am engaging with the early years sector to explore how this can be addressed. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that my Department is not an employer of early years educators. While my Department is a significant funder of childcare services, recognised employer and employee groups are the most important stakeholders in putting agreed pay structures in place in any sector.  </p>  <p>  In terms of improving pay and conditions I have suggested to the early years sector that they could apply to the Labour Court for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO), asking the Court to make a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years sector. </p>  <p>  Under a SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders. It should be highlighted that my Department would have no role in relation to the SEO process, but, as a significant funder and with policy responsibility for quality, my Department would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the matter of the application for a SEO for the sector. I would be very supportive of any reasonable measures aimed at improving pay and conditions in the early years sector. While my Department does not have direct control over the matter, it will continue to support any appropriate initiatives in this area.</p>  <p>  In the interim, my Department continues to invest significant resources in the early years sector. In the last three Budgets (2016, 2017 and 2018) investment in the early years sector has increased by 87%, which reflects the emphasis being placed on developing quality services with appropriately supported staff. This additional investment is helping to address affordability, access and quality, although it is recognised that there is more to be done. The announcement in Budget 2018 that we will increase ECCE capitation rates by 7% from September 2018 is intended to support the childcare workforce. </p>  <p>  Childcare workers are part of a growing sector that the Government strongly supports. I believe that by working together with all key stakeholders we can ensure that it is a viable and strong sector which makes a significant contribution to the care and early education of our children.</p></reply>

This development involves intensive work across legislative, ICT, administrative, governance and communications areas.</p>  <p>  With regard to the legislation establishing the new Affordable Childcare Scheme, the Childcare Support Bill completed its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas on Tuesday, 26th June, and is expected to be enacted in the coming days.</p>  <p>  The Childcare Support Bill will be underpinned by detailed secondary legislation and formal policy guidelines.  Work is currently ongoing on both of these and also on the development of regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services by the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate.  These latter regulations will be introduced in advance of the Affordable Childcare Scheme to allow services to register and thereby participate in the scheme from its inception.</p>  <p>  With regard to the development of the ICT system, our work is subject to an independent peer review process under the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer to ensure that it is rigorous, robust and of the highest possible standard.  Against a backdrop of detailed preparatory work, at the beginning of the year, I published a Request for Tenders for the development of the scheme's IT system.  An evaluation of tenders received has now been completed, a preferred bidder has been notified and the contract negotiation phase is underway.  This final contracting phase involves the agreement of a project implementation plan for the IT system which will set out timelines for its development, testing and 'go live'.  Once this project implementation plan is agreed as part of the IT contract, and approved by the independent Peer Review Group, I will be in a position to confirm and communicate a planned start date for the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  I am happy to say that good progress is being made too on the administrative, governance and communications areas. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also wish to note that 76,000 children have availed of childcare subsidies under the interim measures introduced in September 2017 in order to fast-track some of the benefits of the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p></reply>

All children between 6 months and 3 years old who are in a Tusla-registered childcare setting will, therefore, regardless of parental income, qualify for a childcare subsidy under the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  The basis for determining the level of targeted subsidy will be a family's net income. On the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme, all families with a net income (after allowable deductions) of less than &euro;47,500 per annum will qualify for some level of targeted subsidy.</p>  <p>  In advance of the Scheme starting, there is considerable difficulty in predicting the number of children who will benefit from subsidies under the Scheme, because of uncertainty around 'dynamic' effects on the demand for childcare. The increased subsidies and wider access to subsidies that will arise with the Affordable Childcare Scheme are likely to increase the demand for Tusla-registered childcare (including Tusla-registered childminders) through increasing parents' participation in the labour market and through incentivising parents to switch from unregistered childcare to registered childcare. The lack of Irish evidence on the price elasticity of demand for childcare makes it hard to estimate the likely scale of these effects.</p>  <p>  In addition, the number of children who benefit from subsidies will depend on the response by childcare providers, as the subsidies will only be available to providers who choose to participate in the Scheme. A particular uncertainty here is the number of currently unregistered childminders who are eligible to register with Tusla and who may choose to do so for the first time in order to take part in the Scheme. While the number of registered childminders is small at the moment, work is commencing on the development of a childminding action plan, which is intended to increase the number of registered childminders over the years ahead.</p>  <p>  As a result of these various uncertainties, at this stage we do not have a single estimate of the likely number of beneficiaries or the cost of the scheme.</p>  <p>  However, the Regulatory Impact Analysis published in December 2017 estimated that the full-year costs of the Scheme might amount to between &euro;165m and &euro;193m, though the full impact of the dynamic effects might only be seen over time rather than in the first year of the Scheme. The &euro;165m cost estimate, which was drawn from a model developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, assumed that approximately 82,000 children would benefit from childcare subsidies under the Affordable Childcare Scheme, of which approximately 59,000 were expected to benefit from a targeted subsidy and 23,000 from a universal subsidy. </p>  <p>  The estimates of the number of beneficiaries, including the likely number of beneficiaries in different income-brackets, continue to be re-examined on an on-going basis, as new data becomes available.</p></reply>

Its independence in this regard is one of its key strengths.</p><p>The Health Act 2007 allows for HIQA to register designated centres - which can incorporate all children's residential centres - run by Tusla, the voluntary sector  and private companies. I am glad to say that  work to enable the commencement of the relevant provisions is well underway, with regulations at an advanced stage and Standards awaiting formal sign off. I am hopeful that the new registration model will be effective shortly.</p><p>What this will mean is that all new and existing children's residential centres will need to meet national standards and regulations in order to be registered to operate by  HIQA. Additionally, HIQA  can seek the de-registration of any children's residential centre from the District Court where they form a view that regulations are not being complied with.  The commencement of the relevant provisions will bring children's residential services in line with nursing homes and disability residential services. </p><p>At  my request, HIQA recently undertook a statutory investigation into Tusla's management of child abuse referrals. I received their report in recent weeks and a key recommendation made was that my Department, with the assistance of HIQA, would undertake an international review of best practice in the regulation of children's social services in order to inform the development of a regulatory framework for these services in Ireland. This work is commencing, and the findings of the review will inform the policy direction for regulation of children's preventative and protective services provided in the community.</p></reply>

These are used to assess the risk in the event of a child going missing and the appropriate action to be taken.  A child in care is considered to be missing when his or her whereabouts are unknown and the Absence Management Plan indicates concern for the child&rsquo;s safety.   It should be remembered that most children in care live in family settings in the community and, like all teenagers, will have curfews to return home. </p>  <p>  As children and adolescent's needs differ, there will be an individual judgement made in relation to how late a child may be in returning to their foster carers or residential centre. The length of time alone cannot be used to determine whether a child qualifies as missing from care, rather it is a combination of the time period with all other circumstances of the case that must be considered.  For example, if a child is not allowed unsupervised time outside the home and cannot be found in the home, this will be counted as an incident of a child missing from care regardless of the period of time involved.</p>  <p>  Tusla operates a procedure which records each missing from care incident and liaises with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as necessary.

The CPNS is accessible to named professional groups subject to strict protocols.</p><p>Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Approximately 60% of referrals to Tusla are of a child welfare concern with the remaining 40% related to child protection concerns.  Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services. At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of harm, the child protection pathway is followed. In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.</p><p>Using the most recent data available, I can inform the deputy that, as of March 2018, there was 1,250 children active on the CPNS.  Tusla does not collate data by county but by administrative area.

The programme provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in disadvantaged rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population.    </p>  <p>  CL&Aacute;R was originally launched in October 2001 to provide targeted investment in disadvantaged rural areas.  The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996.  The Cooley Peninsula was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease. The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R areas over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002.  The analysis of the Census data was carried out at a district electoral division (DED) level and all areas designated as being 'CL&Aacute;R' areas are designated on a DED basis.  In order for an area to be eligible to receive funding under the CL&Aacute;R programme it must be in one of the designated CL&Aacute;R DEDs which meets the population loss criteria.  There is no appeals mechanism.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to carry out a full review of qualifying CL&Aacute;R areas later this year on the basis of the 2016 Census data.  This review will involve a detailed examination of all areas of the country, as well as stakeholder consultation.  However, the level of depopulation will continue to be a primary factor in the designation of CL&Aacute;R areas.</p>  <p>  The findings of the review will inform the CL&Aacute;R programme into 2019 and beyond.</p></reply>

The definition of a stillbirth contained in that Act was carried forward to the Civil Registration Act 2004 which now provides for the registration of stillbirths, in section 28.</p>  <p>  When the 1994 Act was introduced it was primarily to afford comfort to the bereaved parents.  For this reason it was felt that the definition of a stillbirth should be as wide as possible, consistent with accepted medical norms.  During the passage of the 1994 Act detailed consideration was given, by the Oireachtas, as to what the most appropriate definition of a stillbirth should be.  It was decided to use the broadest definition available to allow as many registrations as possible.  The definition that was agreed on is based on the international medical meaning of the term 'stillborn child'.</p>  <p>  The definition is now contained in section 2(1) of the 2004 Act and provides that a stillborn child "means a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life".</p>  <p>  Stillbirths which occurred in Ireland prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act may be registered, if the criteria set out in this definition are fulfilled.</p>  <p>  The definition of 'stillborn' varies from country to country.  Some countries use gestational age only, while others use weight, or a combination of both.  In Ireland, in order to broaden the definition, either criterion can be used.  For international comparison purposes the World Health Organization recommends that a stillbirth be defined as a baby born with no signs of life at or after 28 weeks' gestation.</p>  <p>  While acknowledging that the loss for the family concerned there are no plans to amend the legislation as the definition of a stillbirth contained in the 2004 Act is consistent with accepted medical norms.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 914,000 customers in receipt of free travel.</p>  <p>  The six month survey period is necessary to capture possible seasonal fluctuations in passenger traffic.  My Department is satisfied that this length of time produces a very fair and equitable result bearing in mind the obligation to ensure that value for money is obtained for the tax payer and also that operators in the scheme are fairly compensated for the carriage of free travel pass holders.  These payment mechanisms are reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  Whilst my Department appreciates that the carrying out of a survey and the associated manual recording of data is a labour intensive project, it is not possible to review payment of existing operators in respect of the Free Travel Scheme in the absence of survey data.  It is with this in mind that the Department is encouraging private operators to install the integrated ticketing technology which automatically reads the free travel variant of the Public Services Card (PSC) and would significantly reduce the workload in carrying out these surveys.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Customers of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and who are also in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance automatically qualify for the TSA.  Approximately 127,000 customers are in receipt of the TSA payment.  The estimated full year cost of the scheme is &euro;16.14 million.</p>  <p>  The primary objective of the TSA is to allow the most vulnerable people access to personal alarms or phones for security.  The allowance will also encourage social contact and assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.  </p>  <p>  In the previous Budgets, the Government has concentrated resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the household benefits package.</p>  <p>  The criteria for the TSA are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  Fuel Allowance is a means tested payment and these criteria will ensure that the TSA payment goes to those most at risk of social isolation. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the TSA scheme to all pensioners regardless of their means or personal circumstances or to reinstate the telephone allowance element of the household benefits package would have significant budget implications and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs supports continuing strong economic recovery and employment growth.  Policies and actions to ensure that unemployed people benefit from the increase in employment are set out in the strategy paper Pathways to Work 2016-2020. </p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing long-term unemployment.</p>  <p>  Latest available data shows that the long-term unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to 2.1% in Q1 2018.  The actual number of people out of work for a year or more has fallen by more than three-quarters, from 215,000 in early 2012 to 50,000 now.</p>  <p>  Long-term unemployment can be expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment.  Already, we have exceeded our target to bring long-term unemployment below 2.5% in accordance with Pathways to Work targets for 2020.</p>  <p>  Policy continues to focus on support for the long-term unemployed.  For example, the Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy prioritises long-term unemployed people &ndash; most notably through the roll-out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group; through targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and through reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes.</p>  <p>  This continued policy focus, together with the continuing strong performance of the economy, will support further reductions in long term unemployment.</p></reply>

They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants. </p>  <p>  While the motion called for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to meet with unions with a view to addressing the issue of CE supervisors&rsquo; pension provision, the issue is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issue relates to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a full-time caring role.  </p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  A person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example, awarded when on Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used, subject to the total credits not exceeding 20 years.</p>  <p>  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits (before or after 1994), over a 50 year period and qualify for a maximum rate pension, despite additional gaps of up to 10 years.  Those with fewer contributions will have a pro-rata entitlement.  For example, someone with 18 years PRSI contributions and 18 years homecaring may qualify for a 90% contributory pension.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to draft legislation to enable implementation of these arrangements.  In line with the legislation, IT solutions must be developed to implement the changes.  Accordingly, in the final quarter of this year, the Department will begin inviting impacted recipients of the State Pension (contributory) to seek a review of their pension calculations, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019, backdated to the 30th March 2018.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Customers of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and who are also in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance automatically qualify for the TSA.  Approximately 127,000 customers are in receipt of the TSA payment.  The estimated full year cost of the scheme is &euro;16.14 million.   </p>  <p>  The primary objective of the TSA is to allow the most vulnerable people at risk of isolation, including the elderly and those with disabilities, access to personal alarms or phones for security.   The allowance will also encourage social contact and assist in the prevention of social isolation for those groups.   </p>  <p>  The criteria for receiving the TSA requires a person to be in receipt of the living alone increase.  People on widow&rsquo;s non-contributory pension are automatically transferred to the State pension non-contributory once the recipient reaches the age of 66 (i.e.  at State pension age) to ensure alignment with the secondary benefits that are available to people in receipt of the State pension, and may qualify for the living alone increase and the TSA at that time.   </p>  <p>  The schemes that allow a person aged under 66 to receive the living alone increase or the TSA are Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance, Incapacity Supplement or Blind Pension.  Because of the qualifying criteria for these schemes recipients would be considered more vulnerable to social isolation.  This is not generally the case for people in receipt of widow&rsquo;s non-contributory payment who are aged less than 66, and who will not, as a rule, have an incapacity of that nature.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend both the living alone increase and the TSA to include people on the widow&rsquo;s non-contributory payment would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  It would also be necessary to consider whether they would be a priority group for the extension of such benefits ahead of other groups.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

CA is a primary social protection income support paid by my Department to those on low incomes who are providing full-time care and attention to a person requiring such care.  </p><p>FCA which is the responsibility of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, which falls under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, is intended, not to provide income support, but to recompense foster carers for the expense incurred in relation to looking after a child.  </p><p>Foster carer&rsquo;s may qualify for a range of income supports from my Department including:</p><p>- CA, where a foster carer is providing full-time care and attention to a child who requires such care, subject to satisfying the scheme conditionality.  </p><p>- Monthly child benefit in respect of the foster child,</p><p>- A weekly increase - &euro;29.80 - for a qualified child (which can include a foster child) where the foster parent or his or her spouse/partner is in receipt of a weekly income support from my Department,</p><p>- The Back to Work Family Dividend where the foster parent transitions from eligible social welfare payments into employment and</p><p>- Working Family Payment (formerly known as Family Income Supplement) where the foster child is a qualified child for the purposes of the scheme and the foster family qualify for a payment.</p><p>In addition, social welfare legislation provides that foster care allowances paid by Tusla are not taken into account in assessing the means of any weekly social assistance payments.</p><p>Foster carers operate within a very specific framework, are subject to rigorous scrutiny and ongoing monitoring by Tusla and the children in their care are subject to a care plan.  These factors mean that foster carers have additional responsibilities and duties in respect of those children, such as working with the children's families, Tusla and Health Service Executive personnel.  The weekly rates of FCA are &euro;325 and &euro;352 per week for a child under 12 and a child over 12 respectively.</p><p>I should point out that weekly rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance at &euro;214, is among the most generous in the social welfare system, and the means test is also substantially higher and applies disregards of &euro;332.50 for a single/legally separated person and &euro;665 for a carer who is married, in a civil partnership or co-habiting.  This disregard applies to any means that a carer may have i.e.  earnings, savings, property, etc.</p><p>The tax treatment of carer&rsquo;s allowance and foster care allowance is a matter for the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

The NPPR charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.</p><p>The self-assessed charge was set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such charge or fee, remains unpaid.</p><p>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR charge.  The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities.  If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014.  As the charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013.In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen.</p><p>Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect NPPR charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted.  The guidelines, which are available at <i>, </i>encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases.  It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR charge liability from owners.  In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.  All non-compliant owners or owners with queries should log on to <i>www.nppr.ie </i>or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make any outstanding payments.</p><p>Should an initial claim of hardship be rejected by a local authority, the claimant should also be afforded, if requested, a further appeal to a more senior officer in the local authority.  Ultimately, should a subsequent appeal be unsuccessful the complainant should be notified as early as is possible.  Claimants should also be informed that if they are still not happy with the determination they can appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The Garda may request photographic or other identification.

The management of identity verification is a crucial element in the overall integrity of the register and will be the subject of detailed consideration to ensure we find the correct balance between efficiency and accessibility and the need for robust systems we can continue to rely on.  </p>  <p>  Conscious of the importance of the register and its role in our democracy and the need to ensure security and integrity are key priorities for any changes being considered, the process being planned is expected to take 2-3 years to complete.  This will include a significant consultation element at an early stage, currently anticipated in the Autumn, which will offer an opportunity to all relevant stakeholders, including the public, to contribute.  </p></reply>

I want to see local authorities realise new social and affordable homes from their lands without delay, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.</p><p>To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map.  The map also includes details of some 300 hectares of land in the ownership of other State or semi-State bodies, with the potential to deliver a further 7,500 homes.  Importantly, we have large sites in Dublin, Cork and other key urban areas where housing and homelessness pressures are greatest.  All these sites can be viewed at the following link:<i></i></p><p><i></i>Many local authorities have well-developed plans for many of their sites.  Backed by &euro;6 billion in Exchequer funding under Rebuilding Ireland, significant progress is being made in ramping up the social housing programme.  The most recent details of the social housing construction programme are published on the Rebuilding Ireland website and can be accessed at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>In addition, local authorities in Dublin are bringing forward major sites for mixed-tenure development such as the 900 homes at Kilcarbery in Clondalkin, where procurement will be finalised in the Autumn, and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, a site capable of delivering 600 homes in the City Council area where the procurement process is moving into competitive dialogue stage and should be finalised in early 2019.  Proposals for other key sites across Dublin are also being developed.  </p><p>With regard to the provision of affordable homes to buy or rent, early indications from the key local authorities identified lands for 4,000 affordable homes and we are working to increase this ambition to 10,000 homes in the longer term.  In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing increased funding of &euro;75 million for enabling infrastructure, via the Serviced Sites Fund.  I have recently invited applications under the Fund.  </p><p>Furthermore, I have now commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  </p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p><p>The terms of the Scheme involve discounts of 40%, 50% or 60% off the purchase price of the house, linked to the tenant&rsquo;s reckonable annual income.  On the sale of a house under the Scheme, the local authority will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equivalent to the discount granted to the tenant.  Generally, the charge withers away over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years depending on the level of discount involved, as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Reckonable Annual Income</th><th>Discount</th><th>Charge period</th></tr><tr><td>Between  &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000</td><td>60%</td><td>30 years</td></tr><tr><td>Between  &euro;20,001 and &euro;29,999</td><td>50%</td><td>25 years</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 or more</td><td>40%</td><td>20 years</td></tr></table></p><p>The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature.  This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p><p>In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.  The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p><p>The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  In finalising the report some further consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements.  These matters are now almost completed and I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area, as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority owned land, and that analysis is progressing well.  </p>  <p>  I am also determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future.  It is clear that there is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working to get our first cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, ready for tenders to issue shortly.  In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency are undertaking detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site, at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development.  The work of that multi-disciplinary team is progressing well and should be concluded shortly.   </p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I have decided to provide additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  Given that housing-related infrastructure will now be able to avail of funding under the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, I am redirecting the &euro;50 million funding for Phase 2 of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund to the Serviced Sites Fund, increasing the scale of the fund from the previously announced &euro;25 million to &euro;75 million.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  The call for proposals under the Serviced Site Fund issued last week.   </p></reply>

In addition, the Report shows that 74% of local authority areas now contain less than 10 unfinished developments, with four local authority areas having no occupied unfinished developments.</p><p>The number of developments, and dwellings, deemed as 'unfinished' was recorded as part of the 2017 National Housing Developments Survey and figures at a county level are available at the following link: </p><p><i>. </i></p><p>A National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) was introduced to develop more streamlined systems and procedures in relation to the taking-in-charge process.  In Budget 2014, this was supported by a once-off provision of a &euro;10 million Special Resolution Fund (SRF) to pilot and trial new approaches, which will be documented in a report on the NTICI that I intend to publish later this Summer.</p><p>Funding of the resolution and taking-in-charge process is now firmly centred on investment by housing providers and their funders, as well as income from bonds and securities.  In view of the progress made within a predominantly housing provider, funder and local authority enforcement driven resolution process, the relatively small cohort of unfinished developments remaining and the scope for investment to resolve such developments in a recovering housing sector context, I have no current plans to allocate additional public funds in relation to unfinished developments.</p><p>Local authorities will continue to assess the best options for resolution for the remaining unfinished developments and provide consultation and support for residents, developers and financial institutions.  They will continue to use their powers under the various Acts and legal instruments available to them and my Department will continue to provide oversight and assistance to the local authorities in carrying out these duties.</p></reply>

Importantly, we have large sites in Dublin, Cork and other key urban areas where housing and homelessness pressures are greatest.  We now have a very good picture of all local authority residential lands and authorities have well developed plans for many of their sites.  Details of some 1,700 hectares of residential land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership are available to view and access on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, at the following link:</p><p><i><i></i></i><i>.</i></p><p>My Department does not hold data on lands owned by Approved Housing Bodies (AHB).  The oversight of AHBs is currently conducted through the Voluntary Regulation Code (VRC), Building for the Future, A Voluntary Regulation Code for Approved Housing Bodies in Ireland, which is available at the following link:<i>. </i></p><p>At present, 245 AHBs are signed up to the VRC which is overseen by the Interim Regulation Committee (IRC), based in the Housing Agency.  While annual regulatory returns for the AHBs which are signed up to the Code are submitted to the Housing Agency's Regulation Office, I understand that the Regulation Office does not, as a matter of course, collect detailed data on the land owned by AHBs. </p><p>In terms of housing delivery, backed by &euro;6 billion in Exchequer funding, significant progress is being made in ramping up the social housing programme.  At the end of 2017, there were 13,400 social housing homes in the construction programme, up substantially on the 8,500 homes in the programme just a year earlier, and this continues to grow on a weekly basis. </p><p>In addition, Dublin local authorities are bringing forward major sites for mixed-tenure development such as the 900 homes at Kilcarbery in Clondalkin, where procurement will be finalised in the Autumn, and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, a 600-home site in the City Council area where the procurement process is moving into competitive dialogue stage and should be finalised in early 2019.  Proposals for other key sites across Dublin are also being developed. </p><p>I have commenced the statutory provisions for the new affordable purchase scheme.  Early indications from the key local authorities identified lands for 4,000 affordable homes and we are working to identify suitable lands through which the ambition can be increased to 10,000 homes.

It was developed through a working group of key stakeholders involving local authorities, the Water Services Transition Office, Irish Water, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes as well as my Department.  The programme provides for the funding of demonstration Group Sewerage Schemes, through Measure 4(d), where clustering of households on individual septic tanks is not a viable option, particularly from an environmental perspective. </p>  <p>   Local authorities were invited in January 2016 to submit bids under the programme.  Milltownpass Village Group Sewerage Scheme was not included by Westmeath County Council in their bids for inclusion in the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme.  </p>  <p>   My Department is currently addressing the recommendations contained in the April 2017 report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services as they relate to the rural water sector.  In this regard, in April 2018, I established a Working Group to conduct a wider review of the investment needs of rural water services.  In addition to my Department, the Working Group comprises: the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health Service Executive, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and the County and City Management Association.</p>  <p>  The Working Group, which has met twice to date, is considering how best to position and resource water services in rural areas so that they can contribute further to the development and long-term sustainability of a comprehensive and cohesive rural water sector that will have the capacity to produce quality outcomes comparable to those available to customers of public water services.</p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the review provide that there will be a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group.  Strand 1 will consider the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme from 2019 up to 2021, while Strand 2 will consider the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the rural water sector.  It is intended that by the end of July the Working Group will produce a summary report on Strand 1 of its deliberations which will outline the rationale for funding priorities for the next cycle of the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme up to 2021.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the outcome of the review, and decisions to be taken on measures to be included in the programme from 2019 to 2021, applications will be invited from local authorities in respect of funding for that period.</p></reply>

Taking the foregoing into account, the total per unit investment by Dublin City Council was in the region of &euro;58,000 per house, thereby facilitating the affordable delivery and ultimate lower sale prices of the homes. </p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  Given that housing-related infrastructure will now be able to seek funding under the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, I am redirecting the &euro;50 million funding, originally earmarked for a further call under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, to the Serviced Sites Fund, increasing the scale of the Fund from the previously announced &euro;25 million to &euro;75 million.

If MTR is an option, it is a matter for the borrower to discuss this with their lender, who will provide all the documentation to apply for the scheme.  If MTR is not an option, it will be a matter for the borrower to discuss with their lender if there are other options available to resolve their mortgage arrears situation.</p><p>The Abhaile service, formally launched by the Government in 2016, is a national mortgage arrears resolution service, provided free of charge to the borrower and its aim is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and their lender to find the best solution for their particular situation.

It is an example of a highland blanket bog and as such is given priority status on Annex I of the EU habitats Directive. The conservation value of the site is increased further by the presence of good examples of several other annexed habitats, including that of two threatened bird species.

This is a scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures (i.e. structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures). It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m nationally for this Scheme in 2018. </p><p>In 2017 and 2018 I allocated a total of &euro;119,000 for five projects in County Kildare under the Structures at Risk Fund. This Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  I have allocated &euro;1.324m nationally for the Structures at Risk Fund 2018. </p><p>Details of the projects approved for funding under both of these schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and local authority websites. And I refer the Deputy also to my response to a very similar question as this in the House on 21 June last.</p><p>My Department has provided &euro;350,000 in funding to the OPW in 2018 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership. The two Departments continue to work closely together on survey, excavation and research work relating to our national monuments.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes for 2018 are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p><p>In terms of future funding, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027<i></i>represents a major capital investment programme of close to &euro;1.3 billion in funding over the next 10 years. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

It is included in the Record of Monuments and Places under the National Monuments Acts and is entitled to the statutory protections of those Acts. </p>  <p>  I fully appreciate the extent of the local interest in the friary and the understandable desire to see the substantial works to safeguard it carried out as soon as possible. As far as the State's ability to assist is concerned though, the position is that there are already approximately 1,000 national monuments in its care which demand very extensive resource allocations, both in terms of funding and personnel. </p>  <p>  The care, maintenance and presentation of each of these national monuments is undertaken by the Office of Public Works in consultation and with the advice of my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service in every case. Against the background of the resources needed to service the extensive portfolio of monuments already in State care I regret that it is not possible at present to consider adding the local authority owned Court Abbey to that list. </p>  <p>  My Department does, however, operate a number of schemes that provide financial support for the conservation and protection of historic buildings. These schemes are administered by local authorities and include the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Structures at Risk Fund. Details are available on the Department's and on  local authority websites.</p>  <p>  The closing date for the 2018 funding, under which 12 projects in Co. Sligo are being assisted, has now passed.  My Department remains in contact with local authorities throughout the year to ensure the best possible use of allocations, including by redistributing  monies when, for example, projects do not go ahead. I would encourage the local authority in this case to consider pursuing this alternative avenue of funding for Court Abbey.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the Structures at Risk Scheme will be revamped and become the  Historic Structures Fund and it is open to Sligo County Council to apply for support under that fund when it is rolled out later this year.</p></reply>
