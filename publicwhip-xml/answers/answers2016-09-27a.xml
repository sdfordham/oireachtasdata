The EU and NATO have a long track record of cooperation which has comprised political consultations and practical cooperation on crisis management operations. This includes operations undertaken by both NATO and the European Union under UN mandates or directly in support of deployed UN blue hat operations.  The declaration highlights seven key areas where the EU and NATO can further strengthen cooperation and include, countering hybrid threats; broadening cooperation on maritime security and migration; expanding cooperation on cyber defence; developing coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities; facilitating a stronger defence industry and defence research; stepping up coordination on exercises and supporting countries in building their defence and security capabilities<i>.</i>They represent practical areas of cooperation in support of international peace and security, international crisis management operations and the protection of civilians.</p><p>The EU and NATO are currently developing a process for a way forward with the aim of developing a single set of proposals that will be agreed by both the EU and NATO Councils.</p><p>The Treaty on European Union recognises the practical importance of EU cooperation with NATO, where 22 EU member States are also members of NATO. Ireland supports such cooperation between the two organisations in line with the EU Treaties. The EU NATO declaration confirms that future cooperation will fully respect the decision making autonomy of both organisations and will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of any Member States. I am satisfied that this is a strong acknowledgement that Ireland&rsquo;s policy of neutrality will in no way be affected by enhanced cooperation between these two organisations.</p></reply>

The Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for the internal security of the State. However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. In these circumstances a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.</p>  <p>  In relation to non-security related emergencies, whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role.</p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are also represented on the eight Regional Working Groups that have been established under the Framework and, on an ongoing basis, designated members of the Defence Forces, based around the country, act as Liaison Officers to Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments in response to emergencies and natural disasters.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Defence Forces hold a wide range of engineering and transport plant and equipment for military purposes. All such plant and equipment suitable for use in emergency situations is made available as the need arises.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Naval Service, all vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that, in addition to their fishery protection role, they also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and Search and Rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard, amongst other duties while on patrol. These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  The role of the Air Corps includes the provision of an emergency inter-hospital Air Ambulance service in support of the HSE. It is also supporting the HSE in an emergency aeromedical support service operating primarily in the West of Ireland. The Air Corps also has a maritime surveillance function undertaken by its maritime patrol aircraft and both it and the Naval Service provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations.</p>  <p>I am satisfied that Defence Forces continue to be developed in line with requirements needed to fulfil all roles that are assigned to them by Government in any emergency situations that may arise.</p></reply>

Following a tender competition, a contract was placed in October 2010 with Babcock Marine, UK, for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service with the option of a third OPV.  The first ships L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett was named and commissioned in May 2014 and the second and L&Eacute; James Joyce was named and commissioned in September 2015.</p>  <p>  In June 2014 the Department exercised the option under the original contract to place an order for a third Offshore Patrol Vessel which has been delivered and is due to be formally named L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats and commissioned into operational service in the Naval Service in Galway on Monday 17th October 2016. L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats will replace the recently decommissioned L&Eacute; Aisling. The value of the three-ship contract was just over &euro;199 million, inclusive of VAT.</p>  <p>  In June 2016 agreement was reached with Babcock International for the provision for an additional ship for the Naval Service to be built in their facility in Appledore, Devon. The ship will be the same class as L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett, L&Eacute; James Joyce and L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats. The agreed contract value for the further ship is &euro;66.78 million inclusive of VAT and delivery is expected within two years. This aligns with the planning process in place under the White Paper on Defence which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements.</p>  <p>  The requirement for a fourth ship is regarded as urgent and expedient given the age of the older remaining ships in the fleet, L&Eacute; Orla, L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Eithne all of which are over thirty years of age.  The additional ship will allow the Naval Service meet its patrol day targets with due cognisance to the significant additional operational requirements for the Naval fleet under Operational Pontus in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides for the replacement of the current flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, by a multi-role vessel (MRV).  L&Eacute; Eithne was built in 1984.</p>  <p>In addition, the two existing Coastal Patrol Vessels, L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Orla are due for replacement in the coming years; both ships were also built in 1984.  The White Paper outlines that replacement ships will have countermine and counter IED capabilities.</p>  <p>  Work has commenced in the Department of Defence on further ship acquisition. The specifications for the replacement vessels will be drawn up and a public tender competition will be instigated to cover the supply of such future ships within the overall available funding envelope. The Programme for Government also mentions the acquisition of a ninth ship for the Naval Service. This will be considered in detail in the normal way taking account of the overall ship renewal plan and the progression of the planning exercises to which I have already referred.</p></reply>

I represented Ireland at the conference. I was accompanied by Mr. Maurice Quinn, Secretary General Department of Defence, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and Mr. John O&rsquo;Mahony, Assistant Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  UN Under-Secretaries-General Herve Ladsous (Department of Peacekeeping Operations) and Dr Atul Khare (Department of Field Support) led the UN delegation. The conference was situated as part of the process to reform and improve UN peacekeeping with an emphasis on collective responsibility as a global partnership.</p>  <p>  The conference was the largest ever gathering of United Nations Defence Ministers and focused on the commitment of resources to UN peacekeeping, the development of a coherent shared plan for how peacekeeping can play its part in implementing the Women Peace and Security agenda and a number of key challenges facing UN military deployments.</p>  <p>The plenary began with Ministers taking stock of the progress on pledges of military and police capabilities made at the Leaders&rsquo; Summit in 2015. They then discussed a range of ways to make peacekeeping better, including improvements to planning and performance, increasing the participation of women in peace and security, preventing and responding to instances of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers, and building a rapid-deployment capability for peacekeeping.</p>  <p>  I contributed to the session on the participation of women in peace and security outlining actions currently undertaken by Ireland in that area and confirming our commitment to increase the participation of women at senior decision-making and leadership levels in the Irish defence forces.</p>  <p>  The conference was also addressed by representatives of NATO and two NGOs. NATO highlighted the ongoing and prospective areas of cooperation in capability development, in preparation for deployment, training and actual deployment. The NGOs supported the reform of peacekeeping and the renewed focus on addressing sexual exploitation and abuse.</p>  <p>  The event&rsquo;s Communiqu&eacute; signed by over 60 countries including Ireland, set out ambitious new targets for increasing the role of women in peacekeeping and improving the speed of deployments.</p></reply>

This document will inform strategic decisions on resource allocation and will ensure that such decisions will continue to be made on a prioritised basis in accordance with assessed operational need.  For Budget 2017, the priority is to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately funded to continue to deliver effective services, both at home and overseas, across all of the roles assigned by Government, and to facilitate investment in essential equipment and infrastructure, as identified in the White Paper.</p>  <p>  In 2017, Defence will require funding to provide for the pay and allowances of the Defence Forces and civil servants and civilian employees in the Defence sector.</p>  <p>The non-pay current expenditure will be needed to fund necessary Defence Forces standing and operational expenditure, mainly relating to essential catering, fuel, training and travel costs.</p>  <p>  Capital funding will be required in 2017 to progress the main defensive equipment, infrastructure and IT projects identified and prioritised in the White Paper.</p>  <p>  The Army Pensions allocation, which is primarily demand-led and non-discretionary, will provide retirement benefits to military pensioners and their dependants.</p></reply>

This commitment was also reflected in the White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, which sets out the policy framework for the Defence Organisation for the next ten years and beyond. It is foreseen that the new Institute will have international standing and contribute to the overall development of knowledge and experience in the areas of peace support, leadership and conflict resolution.  Since my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question work continues with a view to establishing an interdisciplinary Institute Development Task Force to progress the concept and develop an implementation plan. It is envisaged that the Task Force will comprise representatives from several Government Departments, the Defence Forces, the Third Level sector and the private sector.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that part of the work of the Task Force will be to develop specific timescales for the establishment and roll out of the proposal but I would hope to be in a position to showcase its initial shape next year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-27a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092700058#WRB02400"><p>In the White Paper on Defence 2015, the Government recognised the important role that the Reserve Defence Force have played in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s defence capability, and in particular to, the spirit of voluntary service which has been the hallmark of the Reserve. The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve.  In that regard, the White Paper also sets out a developmental path for the RDF. It provides that the overarching establishment of the Army Reserve (AR) and Naval Service Reserve (NSR) is to be set at 4,169 personnel, consisting of 3,869 Army Reservists and the expansion of the establishment of the four NSR Units from currently 200 personnel to 300.</p>  <p>  The strength of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) at the end of July, 2016 (the latest date for which figures are available) was 2,141 effective personnel.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a key challenge is to recruit, train and retain sufficient personnel to meet the reserve establishment provided for in the White Paper.  A rolling recruitment campaign for the RDF General Service was launched in September 2015.  An administrative pause was placed on the competition when the PDF General Service competition was launched. The RDF rolling recruitment recommenced on 23 July 2016.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance in terms of both PDF and RDF recruitment so as to deliver the desired effects in terms of maintaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake all roles assigned by Government and to advance the single-force concept. However, within that framework and having regard to the training capacity of the Defence Forces, I am anxious to accelerate the rate of recruitment to the RDF.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, membership of the RDF is voluntary and strength levels are ultimately dependent on how many people actually volunteer for the RDF in any given calendar year and commit to ongoing active participation in training and other activities.</p>  <p>  With regard to Garda clearance, as I advised the Deputy recently, applicants to the Reserve Defence Force are vetted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit as part of the recruitment process. This vetting takes the standard 4 (four) weeks. Additional vetting also takes place appropriate to the role of the Defence Forces as an element of national security infrastructure and the training provided to RDF recruits. Overall security processing time can take up to 12 weeks (twelve). I am assured by the Military Authorities that they are actively addressing any avoidable delays which may occur during the recruitment process, without diminishing the rigour and utility of the procedure.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, at 31<sup>st</sup>July, 2016, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,025, comprising 7,233 Army Personnel, 718 Air Corps Personnel and 1,074 Naval Service.</p><p>The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad and not on a regional basis. As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels.</p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p><p>With regard to training and equipment for the Defence Forces, there is a robust and comprehensive training system in place, which incorporates a wide variety of modern training methods. The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs. A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021.</p><p>The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces is a matter that is kept under constant review. However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take account of the difficult economic environment this country has had to endure in recent times.The budgetary situation dictates the level of funding available for new equipment, training and upgrades. Decisions are made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.</p><p>Defence Forces personnel continue to have the most modern and effective range of equipment and technology available for their training and day-to-day roles. Going forward, the equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the 2015 White Paper. The White Paper recognises that there are several new and or enhanced platforms to be procured.</p><p>In conclusion, I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are adequately equipped and trained with a modern and effective range of equipment, including telecommunications and logistical equipment, to meet the many demands and tasks Government has assigned to them both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

Due to the insidious and addictive nature of drug and substance abuse, it is particularly dangerous in the military environment where personnel are entrusted with both the access to and the responsibility of using firearms and other potentially lethal equipment. Drug misuse has serious implications for the safety of both members of the public and Defence Forces personnel.</p>  <p>  The unique and challenging nature of military service requires that military personnel are free from the presence or influence of any controlled drug or substance and I am fully supportive of both the Defence Forces Compulsory Random Drug Testing (CRDT) and Monitoring Programme and the Targeted Drugs Testing (TDT) Programme.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the Defence Forces drug testing team carried out 13 drug testing operations, testing a total of 1,184 Defence Forces personnel. Of the 1,184 tests, 98.56% were negative. There were 17 positive tests, representing 1.44% of the total tests conducted. Appropriate administrative action ensued in all of these positive result cases.   </p>  <p>  Given the primary aim of both the CRDT and TDT programmes is deterrence, I believe it would be counter-productive to change the programme due to individuals testing positive. Rather, the responsibility is on the individual members of the Defence Forces to ensure that they fully comply with military law in this regard; which the vast majority do, as evidenced by the relatively low number of positive tests.   </p>  <p>  On the basis of the above, there are no plans to change the current CRDT and TDT programmes.</p></reply>

There are three anti-malarial drugs, in use in the Defence Forces; Lariam (mefloquine); Malarone and Doxycycline. The choice of medication for overseas deployment, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications. It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability. I am advised by the Director of the Medical Branch that this has been the policy since the Defence Forces first involvement in overseas service to malarial areas.</p>  <p>  Malaria is a serious disease which killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015, with 90% of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa as reported by the World Health Organisation.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area.</p>  <p>  Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam, remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease. It is notable that no member of the Defence Forces, despite the numbers who have served in malarial areas, have died from Malaria.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at this time to withdraw Lariam from the range of anti-malarial medications available to the Defence Forces.  The use of and the information on medications is kept under ongoing review. </p>  <p>  A working group is currently reviewing developments arising in relation to the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis.  In its earlier work in 2013, the Group investigated all the various issues surrounding the use of Lariam and obtained advice from leading medical experts. Those experts concurred with the practices followed by the Defence Forces in prescribing Lariam.   </p>  <p>  The Group is examining developments in the context of the Defence Forces use of malaria chemoprophylaxis with particular focus on updated patient safety information, changes to Summary Product Characteristics, changes in product licensing/authorisation, identification of any new anti-malarial medications on the market and national and international expert advices on the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis and its usage in other Armed Forces. The Group is continuing to engage with international experts with a view to concluding its report shortly. </p>  <p>  As I already indicated, the health and welfare of the Defence Forces is a priority for myself and the Defence Forces and this will continue to inform the approach to the issue of Lariam.</p></reply>

It is not possible to produce robust county level estimates from the current QNHS data.</p>  <p>  The CSO would have to increase the total number of households interviewed nationally, with a corresponding increase in field staff numbers and costs, in order to produce regular county level estimates to the same standard as the regional estimates currently available from the QNHS.</p>  <p>  Currently the CSO employs 100 interviewers who sample 2,000 households per week to generate quarterly national and regional labour market estimates, at a cost of approximately &euro;4m per annum.

A total of five credit cards are currently in use for official purposes assigned to three Heads of Divisions and two Private Secretaries.  During 2014, a total of &euro;39,250 was charged to these cards.  During 2015, a total of &euro;29,004 was charged to these cards.  No interest amounts were paid in either year.</p>  <p>  Departmental credit cards are used for official purposes only.  They are allocated to officials where the facility will be of practical use in meeting the requirements of official business, for example, to cover travel expenses and official entertainment while away from the office; and to procure goods and services such as on-line conferences bookings, air travel, purchase of IT equipment and library supplies.  Increasingly, on-line bookings for flights, hotels, rail travel and newspaper subscriptions can only be secured with credit cards and online discounts or better value rates are applied for such bookings.</p>  <p>  The use of official credit cards is closely monitored by my Department's Finance Unit on an ongoing basis.  Expenditure must be supported by receipts submitted by card holders each month as part of the approval process for the associated expenditure.  The allocation and use of official credit cards are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to minimising the number of cards allocated.  </p>  <p>  In general, staff in my Department do not use personal credit cards for official expenses.  However, if an official expense is incurred on a personal credit card, the expense can be reimbursed as long as the purchase adheres to normal procurement and approval guidelines. </p>  <p>  The National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO), a body under the aegis of my Department, has two credit cards in operation.  A total amount of &euro;10,936 was charged to those credit cards in 2014 and &euro;12,569 was charged to those cards in 2015.  No bank interest was paid in either year.  Credit cards are used for official purposes only, for example, travel related expenses, conference attendances, ordering research articles and payment of subscriptions.  Credit cards are only used where normal procurement procedures (i.e. using a Purchase Order) cannot be applied, for example, paying foreign hotel bills.   It is not the practice for NESDO staff to use personal credit cards for work purposes.</p></reply>

While the QNHS provides quarterly benchmark estimates of unemployment, the CSO also publishes monthly unemployment estimates. The latest seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment figures for August 2016 indicate that the number of unemployed persons aged 15-74 years in that month was estimated to have been 181,600.</p><p>The primary classification used for the QNHS results is the ILO (International Labour Office) labour force classification.

Prime Minister May affirmed the UK Government's commitment to this comprehensive programme of engagement between our two administrations. This will allow us to continue to work together on a range of issues that are of benefit to all the people of Britain and Ireland such as jobs, trade, tourism and energy as part of our Joint Ireland/UK Work Programme.</p><p>The meeting also gave us the opportunity to discuss developments in Northern Ireland. We reiterated the importance of the partnership between our two Governments in supporting the peace process and in contributing to stability and continued progress in Northern Ireland. We are both committed to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and successor agreements - St Andrews and Fresh Start - and will continue to work in partnership for a prosperous and secure Northern Ireland.</p><p>We also discussed the many issues that arise in the context of the outcome of the recent UK referendum on EU membership. While it is not the outcome that we in Ireland wanted, we fully respect the democratic vote of the people of the United Kingdom. We will work with the Prime Minister and all our partners in the EU and in the Northern Ireland Executive to make sure we achieve the best possible outcome in forthcoming negotiations.</p><p>We agreed that we would work together to ensure that the benefits of the peace process are preserved in any new arrangements which might emerge regarding the United Kingdom's future relationship with the EU.  In particular, we both recognised that Ireland is the only EU Member State that shares a land border with the UK. We are in agreement that we don't wish to see any return to the borders of the past on the island of Ireland.</p><p>The  meeting also gave us the opportunity to have a broader discussion on the common issues of concern in the context of the referendum result such as our close trading relationship and the benefits of the Common Travel Area.  Both the Irish and British Government value the Common Travel Area and will work to keep this in place to the greatest extent possible as part of future arrangements.  There is no desire to limit the freedom of people on both sides of the Irish sea to live, work and travel freely across these islands.<b></b>It will be a key issue for Ireland in the context of negotiating new terms and conditions for the EU&rsquo;s relationship with the UK.</p><p>I discussed the Dublin/Monaghan Bombings and other legacy cases  with Prime Minister May when I met her in July and highlighted to her the importance of dealing with legacy issues and hoped there could be progress on the overall arrangements for dealing with the past. </p><p>I last met with the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and Scotland's First Minister at the Extraordinary meeting of the British Irish Council on 22 July which was called specifically to discuss the BREXIT issue.  </p><p>On 15 September 2016, I met Opposition party leaders with a view to seeking agreement on the issues of public concern that require further investigation in relation to NAMA's sale of Project Eagle and the most appropriate nature and terms of reference for such an investigation. </p><p>On 23 September 2016 I received a number of submissions in the matter and these are currently being considered. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that all matters of public concern are addressed in a speedy and effective manner.</p></reply>

The Statistics Act, 1993 repealed the 1926 and 1946 Statistics Acts, and provided for the release of census forms from these censuses 100 years after the date of the relevant Census.  This means that the 1926 census records will be open to the public by the National Archives in the year 2026.</p>  <p>  In considering the question of release of the 1926 Census, the Government has had to bear in mind any possible impact that early release might have on the confidence of the public in the present day guarantees of statistical confidentiality that the CSO gives to its respondents.</p>  <p>  Confidentiality and privacy are rightly issues of great concern for the public. The legal guarantee of confidentiality that comes with the census, along with the untarnished reputation of the CSO in upholding this guarantee in practice, is important in persuading the public to disclose their private information on the census form. Great care must be taken to ensure that any change would not undermine public confidence in the CSO, which could have the potential to seriously damage the return of data by respondents.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the 1901-1911 census material was for the most part available in microfilm format. This made the digitisation process relatively cost effective and enabled delivery to be relatively efficient.  The 1926 Census has never been micro-filmed and I understand that a significant level of work is required to scan and cross-index the individual return sheets.</p>  <p>  In addition to the confidentiality considerations, the Government is of the view that providing for early release, before vital preparatory work has been undertaken is premature, and that there are a number of issues requiring further consideration before a decision to publish could be made.</p></reply>

The ESA 2010 standards are based on the UN's 2008 edition of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008).</p><p>The revisions to the national accounts and balance of payments statistics published on July 12<sup>th</sup>2016 were driven largely by the relocation of large balance sheets to Ireland, with consequential increases in the economic activity attributable to Ireland.  The information on the relocations and the related activity was supplied to the CSO's Large Cases Unit (LCU) as part of the broad range of data collected by that unit.  The LCU works closely with the largest multi-national groups to ensure that the activities of the Irish resident parts of these complex multi-national structures are correctly identified, measured and reflected in the national accounts statistics and in other CSO outputs.  </p><p>Eurostat visited the CSO on August 30<sup>th</sup>as part of the normal GNI verification processes for national accounts statistics.  The meeting was very productive and the results for 2015 were verified by Eurostat.</p><p>The macro-economic statistics published by the CSO in accordance with the international standards provide a valuable reflection of the complexity of the highly globalised Irish economy relative to other economies and the results highlight the level of concentration of multi-national activity in Ireland.  Because of the open, highly globalised nature of the Irish economy, the measurement challenges caused by globalisation are particularly acute in Ireland's case and the CSO appreciates the difficulties faced by users of our statistics in understanding domestic economic activity. </p><p>The CSO is committed to meeting user needs and is convening an expert group to develop recommendations on how best to meet the statistical needs of users, and in particular, to provide guidance on the development of indicators and analyses that better provide insight to Irish domestic economy activity.  The Group will meet during the period September to November 2016 and will report to the Director General of the CSO.  The report of the group will be published and will be available on the CSO website, along with the CSO&rsquo;s response to the report.</p></reply>

A Declaration was issued, along with a short work programme or &lsquo;roadmap&rsquo; as set out by President Tusk, President Junker and the Slovak Presidency.  </p><p>Discussions covered migration; internal security; external security and defence; and economic and social development, including youth.  I acknowledged the strong concerns our partners have on migration and security, and assured them that Ireland will continue to contribute to the response to the migration crisis.  I also said that we would engage in the further development of the Common Security and Defence Policy in support of international peace and security, as provided for in the EU Treaties. </p><p>I highlighted of course the priority that Ireland - and many other EU partners - attach to economic issues, in particular the Single Market and Digital Single Market; jobs, investment and trade and that we need a balanced approach to the debate about the future of Europe. </p><p>There was also a short discussion at the Summit around the question of ratification of the Paris Climate Change Agreement.  </p><p>There was no discussion of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU; other than a report from President Tusk of his meeting with Prime Minister May; and a reaffirmation of the agreed principles that there can be no negotiations before the UK triggers Article 50, and that access to the Single Market requires acceptance of all four freedoms. In my discussions with other leaders, however, I reminded them again of Ireland&rsquo;s specific concerns on this issue, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, North-South relations, the Common Travel Area and bilateral trade.  </p><p>It was agreed at Bratislava that the process of reflection on the future of Europe should continue at the October and December European Councils.

The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  The immediate objective of the national revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted as soon as possible.  Following this revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation in accordance with Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001.  </p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions and decisions with regard to the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation is his sole prerogative. Section 19(1) of the 2001 Act empowers the Commissioner, after consultation with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the rating authority concerned, to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted.  I am advised that the revaluation programme which began with South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas has also been rolled out to the Dublin City Council area, Waterford City and County Council area and Limerick City and County Council area. Since November 2015, revaluation is currently underway in the County Council areas of Kildare, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath. Additionally, the second revaluation of South Dublin has commenced and statutory valuation orders were recently signed to signal the commencement of the revaluation of Counties Carlow and Kilkenny. The revaluation in these two County Council areas is being conducted on a pilot basis using outsourced external resources. This approach was provided for in the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 to allow the Commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 has as its primary purpose the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and it contains a number of measures in this regard. In addition to the outsourcing of part of the revaluation work, the Act also provided for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation with the assistance of the occupiers of property using elements of self-assessment.  This provision, known as &ldquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo;, is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. This approach, though readily used in personal and corporate taxation codes, has not been used in comparable jurisdictions in relation to property valuations for rating purposes. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Commissioner intends running a pilot project in the County Laois rating authority area using &rdquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo;.  The Valuation Office has conducted the necessary statutory consultations both with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with Laois County Council and is now embarking on the development of appropriate technical and statutory systems of valuation to underpin the pilot project and allow for its initiation in 2017.  Careful planning is required at this stage as the pilot involves an entirely different interaction with occupiers of property than has been the case heretofore. </p>  <p>  The Occupier Assisted participative approach will involve the use of new sophisticated valuation tools for the first time and requires the development and implementation of extensive information and communications technology facilities.  In particular, I am advised that the provision of a wide range of on-line supports will be essential to the success of the project, including use of video and audio technology to assist ratepayers in carrying out their elements of the process. It is also intended that there will be extensive engagement with the ratepayers through an information campaign which will be undertaken to ensure maximum participation to ensure the success of the pilot.</p></reply>

The Report contains a total of 173 recommendations, many of which have implications for a number of Government Departments and services.

The HSE has reported that the review completed by them had the following components: all 16 crisis pregnancy counselling services have been asked to develop a protocol within their own organisation on supporting asylum seeking women through a crisis pregnancy; the Reception and Integration Agency which manages the Direct Provision system in my Department has partaken in discussion with the HSE with regards to elements of the protocol which require liaison with my Department; the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme held a workshop for its funded Crisis Pregnancy Counselling services on the issue of &lsquo;Asylum seeking women and a crisis pregnancy&rsquo; in June last; the workshop addressed the issue of crisis pregnancy in the context of a woman who is seeking asylum and living within the Direct Provision system; and issues such as documentation requirements and the process around travelling outside of the country have been explored.  </p><p>I further understand from the HSE that funded Crisis Pregnancy Counselling is available free of charge in over 40 locations nationwide.</p><p>The Reception and Integration Agency continues to facilitate service providers in engaging with those in Direct Provision accommodation affected by this issue and in reviewing and managing accommodation supports on a case by case basis where required.  </p></reply>

The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation of gambling, including betting and gaming but excluding the National Lottery. </p>  <p>  The new legislation will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at assisting and protecting vulnerable persons, the young and those for whom gambling has become a problem. </p>  <p>  It will include prohibitions on the employment of young persons, they will not be permitted to participate in gambling and there will be arrangements for age verification checks by licence holders.  It is envisaged that the regulatory body proposed in the legislation will include a dedicated inspectorate whose main task will be to monitor compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licence and with the new legislation generally.</p>  <p>  The Scheme proposes the establishment of a Fund to aid research, education and awareness activities and to support gambling addiction treatment programmes. The Fund will be based on contributions from the industry but the proposals will ensure independent supervision of the disbursement of monies collected.   There is also provision in the Scheme for the implementation of self-exclusion measures as referred to by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  It remains the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest feasible opportunity and, in that light, the potential for progression of the Bill was considered during the preparation of the forthcoming legislation programme.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the area in question is patrolled by members assigned to Tallaght Garda station. Tallaght forms part of the wider Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) South Division and on the 31 August 2016, the latest dates for which figures are readily available, there were 544 Garda&iacute;, 33 reserves and 30 civilians attached to this Division, of which 176 Garda&iacute;, 8  Reserves and 12 Civilians were attached to Tallaght Garda station. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Divisional Units such as the Traffic Unit, Burglary Response Unit and the Scenes of Crime Unit and also from the Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Drugs and Organised Crime Unit. The needs of each Division are fully considered within the context of the overall policing needs of the State.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the<font color="#2F2F2F"> &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 40 of these have been assigned to DMR South Garda Divsion.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide. </p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September which includes a special stream for eligible reserve members. The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. Applications must be made through <i><i>www.publicjobs.ie </i></i>before the closing date for applications this Friday the 29 September 2016.The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.  The DMR South and all other Garda Divisions, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p><p>As I have stated previously, when accelerating recruitment it is essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims and the public are well served. I welcome the detailed planning process that the Commissioner and her team have in place to ensure the delivery of increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p></reply>

I do not consider that this is an unreasonable timeframe.  This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in this area of Garda activity, including an increase of over 80 per cent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of the e-Vetting system.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched an e-Vetting system in tandem with the commencement by me of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 in April this year.  E-Vetting facilitates the processing of applications in an on-line format and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am informed that, currently, 85 per cent of organisations registered for vetting are operating the e-Vetting system and the Garda Authorities are working to encourage all other organisations to do so.  For those vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks.</p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application online and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.</p>  <p>  In some individual cases processing times for applications can be longer when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary, which may involve seeking information from abroad, or where errors have been made in the application.  Delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the Garda employment vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-27a.235.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092700062#WRF02300"><p>Since its publication in June, 2015 the Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers, has been under proactive consideration; in the first instance by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform and thereafter on an ongoing basis in my Department and other relevant Government Departments and Agencies. The Report contains a total of 173 recommendations, many of which have implications for a number of Government Departments and services. In the most recent review of progress in June, 91 recommendations were found to have been implemented; a further 49 recommendations were found to have been partially implemented or<b></b>were<b></b>in progress; and the balance remained under consideration. This represents significant progress in taking forward the Working Group recommendations, with 80% now implemented, partially implemented or in progress. I have committed to advancing the remaining 20%, taking into account the necessary resources that some of these will require. It should also be noted that a small number of the recommendations have been superseded by Government initiatives in the interim since the publication of the Report.</p><p>A key recommendation of the Working Group was the introduction of a single application procedure in the protection process. The International Protection Act 2015 provides for such a procedure. My Department is currently preparing all of the necessary steps to commence the Act by the end of 2016. The Act responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and in the Direct Provision system; another key concern of the Working Group.  The successful implementation of the International Protection Act aims that first instance decisions will issue within a 9 months timeframe and therefore the matter of right to work should no longer arise.</p><p>In addition, significant efforts have been placed on dealing with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who don&rsquo;t have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process. </p><p>A transition Task Force was also established last year which put in place important supports to facilitate people with status to integrate into the community. The Task Force reported that 87% of people granted status had moved into the wider community within six months. </p><p>Tangible progress in improving the daily lives of asylum seekers living in Ireland while their application is being processed is also being made. In January last, the former T&aacute;naiste and I announced an increase to the Direct Provision Allowance for children, the first such increase since the introduction of the payment some sixteen years ago. Prescription fees for Direct Provision residents, including children, have also been waived. I have also committed to extending the remit of the Offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include access for residents in Direct Provision centres. This requires amending legislation which will be processed as soon as possible. The Minister for Education and Skills has also announced a second year of their pilot support scheme for students in the protection system for the academic year 2016/2017.</p><p>My Department is currently engaged in a further consultation exercise with the Government Departments and Agencies responsible for the implementation of the Report's recommendations with a view to updating the position published in June.</p></reply>

Precise figures in relation to 2015 have not yet been finalised although it is estimated that the cost will see an increase on the previous year for the first time in recent times. The fluctuation in costs is mainly related to the numbers of persons in the system at any given time, particularly in relation to the numbers in the direct provision system. In that regard, there was a 126% increase in asylum applications in 2015 compared to 2014.</p></reply>

The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to deportation orders. </p>  <p>  In determining whether to make a deportation order, in addition to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, I must also consider Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, as well as any other relevant statutory provisions, Constitutional or international human rights arising.  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the overwhelming majority of persons who arrive at the frontiers of the State without permission to enter or reside here are refused leave to land, without ever reaching the stage where they would be considered under the deportation process.  Indeed, this figure has risen substantially to almost 3,500 last year and is expected to exceed 4,000 this year. Others voluntarily remove themselves before a deportation order is made.</p>  <p>  The legislation in this area was recently amended by way of section 78 of the International Protection Act, commenced on 10 March this year. These amendments have inserted a new section 5 into the Immigration Act 1999 which deals with effecting deportation orders for persons illegally present in the State. Since the legislation was amended, 33 persons have been forcibly removed from the State by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na out of a total of 193 deportation orders effected since 10 March 2016. The increasing number of deportation orders effected since the legislative changes were introduced demonstrates the knock-on effect of the new legislation, as the number of people complying with their deportation orders, without requiring forcible removal by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, continues to increase.</p></reply>

In general, a person may be refused permission to enter the State on one or more of the eleven grounds set out in Section 4(3) of the Immigration Act 2004. Every person refused leave to land in the State is served with a notice in which the reason, or reasons, for refusing an application to enter the State is set out. Persons refused leave to land and who are subsequently removed from the State are returned to their point of embarkation, which in most cases is within the EU.</p>  <p>  In the period May 2014 to May 2015 a total of 167 persons are recorded as being refused permission to enter the State at the land border. The main nationalities concerned were China, Nigeria, Pakistan, India and Somalia.</p>  <p>  In the period May 2015 to May 2016, 300 persons were refused permission to enter the State at the land border.

So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 25 of these have been assigned to Kildare.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. Applications must be made through<i><i></i></i><i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>before the closing date for applications on 29 September 2016. The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.

I recently announced that Ireland will resettle an additional 260 programme refugees from Lebanon in Spring 2017. The mechanism by which the balance of persons will be admitted has yet to be decided.

When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation)  and the Drugs and Organised Crime Unit.

Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September which includes a special stream for eligible reserve members.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>before the closing date for applications this Friday the 29 September 2016.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.  Cavan/Monaghan Division, and all other Garda Division, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p><p>As I have stated previously, when accelerating recruitment it is essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims and the public are well served.  I welcome the detailed planning process that the Commissioner and her team have in place to ensure the delivery of increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the Courts Service had expressed serious concerns at the potential effect of the proposal to rezone part of the site at Hammond Lane as a public park as this would have severely limited the possibilities for the development of the site for a Family and Children Court complex. However, the Courts Service was made aware that the rezoning proposal was withdrawn recently with the effect that the full site at Hammond Lane remains available for this important courthouse development.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the plans for a dedicated and integrated Family Law and Children&rsquo;s Court building on a site at Church Street and Hammond Lane, adjacent to the Four Courts, are progressing. The Courts Service is working with the Office of Public Works on the design of this project and will be working with the National Development Finance Agency on the procurement process with a view to the project being completed by 2020.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy will appreciate that, on occasion, it is necessary for vulnerable prisoners and others to be separated from the general prison population. </p><p>The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors including the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her. </p><p>In addition, the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007.</p><p>The fact that prisoners seeking protection are immediately separated from the general population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat, clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to ensure their safety and security.  The status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed.  If possible, prisoners can be transferred to other institutions where a restricted regime would not be necessary.</p><p>The Director General of the Irish Prison Service has established a high level group to look at measures which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners currently held on restricted regimes with a view to ensuring that all receive, as a minimum standard, out of cell time of 3 hours per day to engage in exercise or activity. </p><p>The Irish Prison Service Statistics Unit commenced the collation of a quarterly Census of Restricted Regime Prisoners in 2013. Since the commencement of the survey in July 2013, the number of prisoners on 22/23 hour lock up has decreased by 137 or 65% from 211 to 74.</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service publish the Census of Restricted Regime Prisoners on their website <i>(www.irishprisons.ie).</i></p></reply>

Where such an individual is under the age of 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the requirement of having a minimum guaranteed pension income for life of &euro;12,700 per annum, he or she is required to "set aside" an amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension fund if less than &euro;63,500 after taking a retirement lump sum) by investing the amount in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) or by the purchase of an annuity. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual, without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life, has a capital "nest-egg" to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement.  The proposal in the question would clearly remove that safety net.</p>  <p>  I introduced changes to the AMRF arrangements in Finance Act 2014, with effect from 1 January 2015, to allow an AMRF owner draw down up to 4% of the value of the fund assets on one occasion annually until he or she either meets the guaranteed pension income requirement or attains the age of 75, at which point, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF and any remaining funds can be drawn down at the owner's discretion. </p>  <p>  In general, drawdowns from AMRFs (and ARFs) are subject to income tax, PRSI (up to age 66) and USC. </p>  <p>  The 4% annual draw down arrangement, replaced the facility that existed previously, whereby an AMRF owner could draw down the accrued income and gains of the AMRF (subject to tax etc.) as and when they wished.  This change was prompted by a concern to allow all AMRF owners, particularly those with relatively modest retirement funds, access to a more certain level of annual drawdown from their AMRF, rather than the uncertain level of drawdown that dependence on investment performance had given rise to heretofore.  This is particularly important for those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to change these arrangements.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations, I as Minister therefore cannot intervene in the independent appeals process of the Board.</p>  <p>  The Medical Board of Appeal's clinical determination is limited to the scope of the six qualifying criteria, and the Board does not have discretion in relation to the application of these criteria.  The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014.  These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

The Fund is resourced by a levy on employers of 0.7% of reckonable earnings in respect of employees in Class A and Class H employments, which represents approximately 75% of all insured employees.  The levy is collected through the PAYE/PRSI system and funds are transferred monthly to the Department of Education and Skills by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The total expenditure from the NTF in respect of 2016 is estimated at &euro;362 million.  Funding includes the pay and non-pay costs of providing Apprenticeship/Training Courses and the cost of training allowances paid to participants on Apprenticeship/Training Courses. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the JobsPlus scheme, which replaced the Revenue Job Assist scheme and the Employer Job (PRSI) Exemption Scheme in July 2013.  JobsPlus provides a grant to employers who employ individuals who are long-term unemployed.  The transtion to a grant-based incentive was made in recognition that tax based incentives are only beneficial where a business has sufficient taxable profits to be able to fully utilise a tax credit or allowance.  Often it would not be possible for a business to estimate profits in advance of taking a decision on whether to employ an additional individual and in this manner a grant based system provides more certainty for employers.</p></reply>

Section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for this exemption.  </p>  <p>  One of the qualifying conditions for the Dwelling House Exemption is that the person receiving the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary) must have continuously occupied the house as his or her only or main residence for a period of three years immediately prior to the date of the gift or inheritance.  Following changes to the relief made by Finance Act 2007, gifts and inheritances of a dwelling house are treated differently in relation to this 3-year occupancy requirement.  In the case of an inheritance, any period in which the disponer occupied the dwelling- house along with the beneficiary counts towards the beneficiary's required 3-year period of occupation.  In the case of a gift, however, any such period of co-habitation does not count towards the required 3-year period of occupation, unless the co-habitation is required as a result of the disponer's old age or infirmity.  As indicated by the Deputy, Section 86 of the CATCA 2003 does not provide for other exceptions such as where a disabled child requires the support of his or her parents.</p>  <p>  This does not mean that the Dwelling House Exemption is not available in any case where a disabled child shares a house with his or her parents.  As I have already indicated, the ability of a disabled child to receive a tax-free gift of a house is restricted, but there is no restriction on his or her ability to avail of the exemption on the inheritance of the house. </p></reply>

The review focused on three key policy objectives for agri-taxation policy, including:</p><p>-increasing mobility and productive use of land</p><p>-assisting succession, and</p><p>-complementing wider agriculture policies and schemes, such as supporting investment to enhance competitiveness, environmental sustainability, alternative farming models such as farm partnerships and responses to increasing income volatility.</p><p>Following on from this review, a significant number of measures were introduced, retained or refocused in the last two Finance Acts to assist with succession, and to support young trained farmers.  These include but are not limited to:</p><p>- Targeting of CAT relief for agricultural property to ensure it is used by active farmers</p><p>- Broadening of CGT retirement relief so that, for example, individuals can now lease out their land for up to 25 years prior to disposal and still be eligible for CGT retirement relief</p><p>- Extension of stamp duty relief for non-residential land transfers between certain close relatives</p><p>- Extension of general stock relief, stock relief for certain young trained farmers and stock relief for registered farm partnerships and</p><p>- Extension of the stamp duty exemption for young trained farmers.</p><p>In addition, a new &quot;succession transfer partnership&quot; proposal was introduced in Finance Act 2015, which is subject to State Aid approval, in order to provide an incentive to assist long-term planning for the transfer of a farm, mitigate some of the financial concerns that may arise when considering how a farm may support two generations for a period, allow a gradual transfer of control and also facilitate knowledge transfer from one generation to another.</p><p>These measures and reliefs are subject to ongoing monitoring by officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and by my officials to assess their impact, and ensure that the policy objectives set for them are being met.</p><p>I am considering the proposals put forward from a number of organisations, including the Irish Farmers Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association as part of my deliberations for the Budget.  I plan to meet these organisations shortly to discuss their proposals also.  The introduction of any further agri-taxation measures in this regard will be a matter for consideration by the Government, and any decisions made will be announced in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill. </p></reply>

Charges are levied by the telecom providers.  The cost of the call from a mobile telephone is, in fact, shared between the caller and Revenue, as is the norm with most LoCall telephone services.  Calls from landlines to 1890 numbers are charged at standard rates, or lower in some instances, by most telecoms providers.  I am advised by Revenue that a significant amount of inbound calls to its 1890 service are still made from landlines and in the twelve month period to mid September 2016, more than half of all calls to Revenue's 1890 service were made from landlines.  </p><p>While the 1890 service is a low cost service, many mobile operators do not treat it as a low call service or as part of 'bundled minute packages' and charge standard rates.  I am advised that it is not possible to provide details of the rates chargeable as it depends on the specific network provider and the particular package the caller is signed up to.  </p><p>Revenue received almost 2.5 million telephone calls on their 1890 service in 2015.  These calls were handled by large numbers of staff in various locations throughout the country.  From Revenue's perspective, and in particular to deliver the quality and reliability of service to which it is committed, it must have a telephone system that can handle the significant volume of business involved, is resilient and stable and ensures continuity of service.  The 1890 LoCall system is the current platform that best delivers on the demands for an effective telephone service by Revenue.  I am assured by Revenue that the options as regards the telephony infrastructure it operates under are kept under regular review.  As developments in telephony and technology evolve to reduce the cost for taxpayers while still preserving the provision of an efficient and sustainable telephone service, these opportunities will be exploited by Revenue. </p><p>Many of the enquiries to Revenue's telephone service relate to matters that are covered by comprehensive information available on its website <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.  For the first eight months of this year, there has been around 52 million &quot;hits&quot; to its website from the public. Revenue is undertaking a significant revamp of its website to make sure that it provides an easy to navigate, readily accessible and free source of all key information for taxpayers and businesses.</p><p>The issue of the cost of mobile calls to 1890 numbers has been raised previously by Revenue with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  In light of the representations from the Deputy I am advised by Revenue that it will raise the issue again with ComReg.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that the State already provides support to athletes both directly and indirectly, and my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism, and Sport has responsibility for such support.</p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the sportsperson's relief, which takes the form of a deduction from earnings and can be claimed for any 10 years of assessment chosen by a qualifying professional sportsperson from the period comprising the year of retirement and the preceding 14 years of assessment.  Qualifying professional sportspersons include athletes, badminton players, boxers, cyclists, footballers, golfers, jockeys, motor racing drivers, rugby players, squash players, swimmers, tennis players and cricketers.  The amount of deduction available is set at 40% of the gross receipts, before deducting expenses, which arose wholly and exclusively from engaging in the sport.  It does not apply where no direct sports earnings exist and is restricted to direct earnings from participation in certain sports.</p>  <p>  As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.  You will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

Where a company acquires a loan book there will be three possible sources of profits which are: the interest payments that are made by the borrowers; the capital repayments made by the borrowers that exceed the capital cost of the loan book to the lender; and any gain arising on the disposal of a loan or any property on which a loan is secured.  </p>  <p>  In addition, to accurately estimate the full impact of the measure would require ex ante knowledge of any behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of the amendment.  Revenue would not therefore be in a position to anticipate the extent and impact of any such behavioural changes or corresponding impact on the tax yield.  The proposed amendment is not finalised which also leads to difficulties predicting any potential yield. </p></reply>

The option was available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that Finance Act 2013 was passed into law, and came to an end on 26 March 2016.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why pre-retirement access to pension savings is not permitted on a general basis, the principal one being that these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to be long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be "locked away" to help fund an adequate income in retirement. </p>  <p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 was allowed on a tax-neutral basis the contributions were tax-relieved at the individual's marginal rate on the way in and were taxed at the individual's marginal rate on withdrawal.  This was a measure designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that 18,671 individuals availed of the early access facility over the 3 year period to the amount of just over &euro;200m gross in drawdowns, on which tax of some &euro;79 million was paid. </p>  <p>  It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs decided to preserve their AVC pension savings.  I have no plans to re-introduce the measure along the lines suggested in the question.</p></reply>

This has been primarily achieved by customers engaging directly with their banks and agreeing a sustainable payment plan which allows the customer an achievable path out of arrears, as well as protecting the value of the loan for the bank.  In many cases these agreements have included elements of debt restructuring and writedowns.  This is the most equitable means of dealing with problem loans for both borrowers and lenders, and I would urge all those in arrears to engage constructively with their bank in order to reach an appropriate repayment arrangement.  In the vast majority of cases this achieves the best outcome for all involved. </p>  <p>  Despite the significant progress made, the levels of NPLs in the Irish banking sector remain elevated by European standards.  Banks are under pressure to reduce these exposures, both from their regulator and the market.  Notwithstanding whether or not the State is a shareholder, it is the management and board of each institution that are tasked with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge. </p>  <p>  In recent years banks have introduced multiple engagement channels to facilitate those customers who are reluctant to engage directly with them.  Having exhausted these initiatives, if meaningful engagement is not forthcoming from particular customers the bank may be left with no option but to look at alternative solutions which could, as a last resort, include the sale of the loan. </p>  <p>  I would note that the bank mentioned by the deputy has commented: "We keep all options under consideration.  Our primary objective is to work with borrowers under stress to return their borrowings to a satisfactory position." </p></reply>

The standard rate is the VAT rate applied to bottled water in the majority of EU Member States.  Prior to 1992 bottled waters and fruit juices had applied at the zero rate, but were made subject to the standard rate from 1 November 1992 in order to correct a competitive anomaly, as similar competing products such as soft drinks were standard rated. The change in the VAT treatment coincided with the removal of excise duty from bottled water.</p>  <p>  Where a product was zero rated prior to 1 January 1991 but subsequently standard rated, it is not possible to reintroduce the zero rate for that product.  However, under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive, Member States are permitted to apply a reduced rate of not less than 5% to bottled water. It would therefore be possible to apply our reduced rate of 9% or 13.5% to these drinks.  However, a reduction in the rate of VAT on such a product would be costly to the Exchequer and I have no plans to reduce the rate of VAT on bottled water. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that the information provided on tax returns does not require the yield from specific products or activities to be identified. It is therefore not possible to provide separate figures on the amount of tax collected from the sale of bottled water. Excise taxes are not charged on bottled water.</p></reply>

The rationale for publishing said proposal was to ensure appropriate feedback is received on a technical and complex section of the Taxes Acts.  My officials are currently in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders to clarify certain aspects of the provision and to ensure the proposal successfully carries out the intention for which it was created. This is an ongoing process and I would like to reiterate that we welcome input from all stakeholders, including Deputies, on the matter.</p>  <p>  Regarding interest deductibility, it is a long standing part of tax law that a person is subject to income or corporation tax not on their gross income, but on their profits, having taken a deduction for the expenses wholly and exclusively incurred in earning those profits.   Where the interest expense of a section 110 company is calculated on an arm's length basis, and where it passes the wholly and exclusively test, then it would not be in keeping with the balance of the Irish tax system to restrict the deductibility of that interest.</p>  <p>  In relation to section 110 companies being owned by QIAIFs,  this would not change the Company Registration Office (CRO) obligations re the filing of returns. If a section 110 company has a shareholder who is an AIF, they are still obliged to file their accounts and these accounts will be publicly available via the CRO website.</p></reply>

This shareholding is a valuable asset to the State and it is the Government's intention that the State would exit this and our other banking investments in a measured and careful manner. As I have indicated on a number of occasions, my primary objective in the disposal of these assets will be recovering the maximum amount of money for the Irish taxpayer.</p>  <p>  I have indicated in the past that an IPO is likely to be the optimal route to recouping value from our investment in AIB. At the beginning of this year officials in my Department appointed an Independent Financial Adviser, following a tender process, to assist with analysis and exit planning and much of this initial preparation has now been completed. However, given the complex nature of an IPO process, the need to access certain IPO 'windows' and the recent volatility seen in stock markets, I would now deem it more likely that a market event involving AIB would occur in 2017, rather than 2016.</p>  <p>  I would acknowledge that the bank is now ready to participate in a market event at a time of my choosing and welcome the continued strong performance of AIB, which has demonstrated sustainable profitability and capital generation over a number of consecutive reporting periods. I would also note the recent comments made by the bank's chairman indicating that AIB may be approaching the time when the board will be in a position to consider the payment of a prudent dividend, in consultation with their regulator, which would contribute to a strong investment case for the bank.</p>  <p>  While Brexit is obviously a significant factor behind the weakness and volatility we have seen in banking equities this year, wider concerns around the future of banking business models, a prolonged period of low and negative interest rates, as well as uncertainty around the strength of global economic growth, are also at play. Clearly in order for us to proceed with an IPO, we would need to be satisfied that the market is prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the business, bearing in mind its current performance and future prospects along with the outlook for the Irish economy. As part of their day-to-day role, officials in my Department will continue to monitor market conditions and  keep all options relating to AIB and our other banking investments under review.</p></reply>

The Commission's analysis of the sector follows strong growth in commercial real estate activity in recent years, with prices having recovered in the region of 55 per cent since the trough in the first quarter of 2013.  As is well documented, commercial real estate prices are subject to pronounced cyclical movements and it is clearly important that developments in the sector are continually monitored.</p>  <p>  In this regard, separate analyses on the Irish commercial real estate market included in the European Commission's Post-Programme Surveillance Spring 2016 Report, and the IMF Financial System Stability Assessment published in July, are inconclusive as to whether prices are over- or undervalued.</p>  <p>  In response to the potential impact of a sudden drop in commercial real estate prices, the economy would be affected through its negative impact on real estate developers and construction activity.  However, growth has been much more balanced across economic sectors since the recovery so the economy would be much less exposed to a decline in activity in the construction sector compared to the experience during the financial crisis.</p>  <p>  As regards its impact on the banking sector, investment in the commercial real estate sector has been much more diversified both in terms of the type and origin of funds.  As indicated in the Central Bank's latest Macro Financial Review, the primary source of the investment in Irish commercial real estate market has been from international private equity funds, REITs and other financial vehicles since 2012.  Domestic banks exposure to the commercial real estate market has been limited for the most part to outstanding loans drawn down prior to the financial crisis.</p></reply>

Prior to that date, the relief was available at the taxpayer's marginal rate.</p>  <p>  Standard rating health expenses relief makes the tax system fairer and more equitable as it provides the same value benefit to all taxpayers with sufficient income against which to claim relief. Previously the system of marginal rate relief allowed higher-income individuals paying the higher rate of income tax to claim a greater relief than was available to lower-income taxpayers liable to tax at the standard rate only. The standard-rating of relief for health expenses also brings the relief more in line with other reliefs such as those for medical insurance and third level fees, which are also granted at the standard rate of tax only.  However I would point out that these other reliefs mentioned have a cap on the maximum amount on which relief can be claimed whereas no cap applies on the maximum value of health expenses that can qualify for relief. </p>  <p>  In my view the availability of relief at the standard rate of income tax for health expenses, including qualifying dental expenses, is the most appropriate use of limited fiscal resources. I therefore do not intend changing the policy in this regard at this time.</p></reply>

One action on mortgage arrears relates to a commitment to work with the Central Bank to amend the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to include an obligation on providers of mortgage credit to provide a range of sustainable arrears solutions.I have written to the Governor of the Central Bank in this regard to request that an assessment be undertaken of the range of available sustainable restructure solutions offered by banks and non-bank entities.  I have asked that this assessment should consider in particular how the available options may impact on the distressed borrower's capacity to remain in their primary residence.  The outcome of the assessment will be important in determining next steps in relation to the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness commitments in respect of the amendment of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland's (The Central Bank) Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that each borrower who is struggling to keep up mortgage repayments is treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by lenders.  The CCMA is a statutory code under section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and can be found at:<i><font color="#2F2F2F"> http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Pages/codes-of-conduct.aspx </font></i>. The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and lenders to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.</p><p>The CCMA also requires lenders to have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower appeal a decision by a lender, including where the borrower is not willing to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement or where the lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement. The appeals procedure must inform the borrower of his/her right to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman. </p><p>The Central Bank monitors compliance with consumer protection requirements on an ongoing basis through themed inspections, reviews and research, mystery shopping and advertising monitoring and it continues to engage with lenders to ensure compliance with the CCMA. </p><p>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the latest Central Bank statistical bulletin, published on 13th September, on residential mortgage arrears presents data to end-June 2016. This release shows the continuing improvement in the level of mortgage accounts with associated arrears, for example, 89 per cent of PDH mortgage accounts have no mortgage arrears.  The number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses (PDH) in arrears continued to fall in Q2 2016, marking the twelfth consecutive quarterly decline.All maturity categories of arrears, including the over 720 days category, declined in Q2.  The 720+ days category recorded a fourth consecutive decline, having fallen for the first time in Q3 2015.120,614 PDH mortgage accounts were classified as restructured at end-June.  Of these restructured accounts 88% were deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement; the highest level since the series began.  </p><p>It is very welcome that the numbers in mortgage arrears have continued to decline across the various maturity categories and those in arrears for more than two years have declined for the fourth consecutive quarter.However, there are still large numbers with long-term arrears, despite the various borrower supports that have been put in place.  Therefore, it is important that we now concentrate our efforts to ensure that those who remain in arrears engage with their lender to resolve their difficulties.  I understand that this will be a major focus for the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service being established on foot of the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

This relief is referred to as the "dwelling house exemption".</p>  <p>  One of the qualifying conditions for the dwelling house exemption is that the individual receiving the gift or inheritance (the "beneficiary") must have occupied the dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for the period of 3 years immediately preceding the date of the gift or inheritance. Another condition is that the beneficiary must not have any beneficial interest in another residential property at the date of the gift or inheritance. A beneficiary is treated as having a beneficial interest in another residential property where he or she inherits more than one such property at the same time, whether or not the individual previously owned any such property.  Therefore, where two residential properties are inherited at the same time, the beneficiary does not qualify for the dwelling house exemption.</p></reply>

On this basis it is estimated that by increasing audit staffing resources by c.200 staff an additional exchequer yield of &euro;100m per annum could be achieved.  </p>  <p>  It was estimated that by increasing staff on compliance projects such as oils, tobacco and alcohol by 100 could raise &euro;20m per annum. It also estimated that increasing staffing on investigations by 20 staff could achieve exchequer savings of &euro;12m per annum. </p>  <p>  On that basis, an increase of 200 staff on audit, compliance and investigation work targeting tax evasion and black market activity could raise between &euro;40m and &euro;100m per annum depending on the mix. In addition, it should be noted that there is a significant deterrent and voluntary compliance effect on behaviour of an effective, risk based compliance programme.  The investment in the training and development of a Revenue auditor or investigator can take up to three years, depending on previous relevant experience. Therefore the full additional yield would not be available immediately.</p>  <p>  Revenue undertakes a range of risk management interventions to target and confront those who do not comply, including tax evasion and black market activity. The objective is that people are deterred from filing inaccurate returns and from engaging in shadow economy activity and smuggling.  The range of interventions has increased in recent years. Interventions include appraisals, aspect queries, profile interviews, assurance checks, enforcement, investigation and prosecutions, as well as audits.  The appropriate intervention depends on the relevant risk. The average rate of return on each type of intervention varies depending on the intervention.  In some types of interventions to tackle evasion and the black economy, such as enforcement, the focus is on the detection of drugs and fiscal smuggling where the direct exchequer yield is not the immediate objective.</p>  <p>  It must also be recognised that Revenue has to prioritise its resources and must, for example, provide service for compliance, by making it easier and less costly to voluntarily comply.  The administration of taxes and duties requires a wide range of specialists and experts.</p>  <p>  In that context in Budget 2015 and Budget 2016 I provided for an increase of 176 (126 and 50) in additional resources to deal with a wide variety of staffing requirements across audit and compliance functions, debt management functions, international tax, etc. In the context of the upcoming budget I will continue to support Revenue's case for resources and meet the diverse range of challenges facing the organisation.</p>  <p>  Revenue appointed over 400 staff from open competitions in 2015, these staff were mainly deployed on Local Property Tax support, International Tax and on compliance interventions. Revenue has appointed over 467 staff to date in 2016 from open recruitment.  The recruitment in 2015 and to date in 2016 has been at all levels and across a diverse range of specialist skills areas such as tax and legal professionals, data analysts, economists and information technology experts.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the recruitment of staff and their training and development is addressed as part of an overall workforce planning process in Revenue. The capacity to recruit and develop Revenue staff needs to be addressed in a coordinated fashion.</p></reply>

The function of the REIT regime is to eliminate the double layer of taxation that is usually associated with holding properties in a corporate or collective vehicle.  A REIT is exempt from any tax on its qualifying income and gains from rental property, however, the REIT is obliged to distribute 85% of its profits to shareholders.  Individuals are liable to tax at their marginal rates, corporates are liable to tax at 25% and for all foreign investors, the REIT will withhold DWT at the standard tax rate of 20%.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that based on information available, that is not possible to estimate the cost of abolishing all tax exemptions specific to REIT, nor is it possible to estimate the projected yield in Capital Gains Tax in such a measure.</p></reply>

Once granted a deferral normally remains in place for the particular valuation period (2013-2019).</p>  <p>  The annual rate of interest currently applied to deferrals is 4%.  The interest is added to the primary LPT liability and the cumulative amount attaches as a charge on the property.  The full liability must be paid before the property can be sold or transferred.</p>  <p>  Almost 35,000 properties with a cumulative LPT liability of &euro;38m have availed of the deferral option since 1 July 2013.  The total interest liability generated to date in respect of these deferrals is &euro;1.6m.  It is estimated that this figure will increase to approximately &euro;3m by the end of the valuation period assuming the number of properties availing of the deferral option remains constant. </p>  <p>  On this basis a 1% reduction in the interest rate for the entire valuation period would cost the Exchequer &euro;.75m, a 2% reduction would cost &euro;1.5m and a 3% reduction would cost &euro;2.25m.  Similar percentage reductions for the years 2017 to 2019 only would cost approximately &euro;.35m, &euro;.7m and 1.05m respectively.  </p></reply>

All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs.  In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also provided. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of resources to schools for children who are deaf and hard of hearing.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>Depending on the needs of the child, deaf and hard of hearing pupils may receive additional teaching support in mainstream schools, either from a school's general allocation of Learning Support Teaching, or from an allocation of additional Resource Teacher hours to the schools from the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p><p>My Department currently provides staffing and funding for two Special Schools for the Deaf - the Holy Family School for the Deaf (an amalgamation of St. Mary&rsquo;s and St. Joseph&rsquo;s Schools for the Deaf) and the Mid West School for the Deaf.</p><p>My Department also provides funding for 16 special classes for pupils with hearing impairment (11 special classes are attached to mainstream primary schools and 5 classes at post-primary level).  </p><p>An enhanced capitation grant is provided to the special schools and special classes for hearing impaired pupils.  </p><p>Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is also provided for pupils in those special schools and special classes, as required.  Pupils who have care needs may receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in schools.  Many deaf and hard of hearing children have access to such SNA support. </p><p>For pre-school children and school-going pupils, funding is provided for a weekly tuition service to promote, develop and implement ISL, in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system, whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents.  An application form is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.  Grants under this scheme are made to parents to  fund ISL tuition and 80 ISL tutors were nominated to deliver tuition through the ISL tuition scheme during the 2015/2016 school year.  </p><p>Grant-aid is provided to schools towards the provision of special equipment such as soundfield systems and radio aids in accordance with my Department's Circular 0010/2013.  </p><p>Funding is also made available through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to enable individual teachers and whole school staff to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language which are available throughout the country, through a variety of providers.</p><p>In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education.  The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met.  This service is available at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels.  </p><p>My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies.  The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language.  The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.  Details can be accessed at: <i></i>. </p><p>The NCSE has also published a parental information leaflet for parents of children who are Deaf of Hard of Hearing, which provides details of the supports which are available.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that assessment, rehabilitation and information services for children with hearing impairment and their families are also funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE), either directly or indirectly.  Services provided include communication therapy and lip reading classes as well as sign language classes.  Other Departments, parents, or external organisations, may also independently source or contract services from ISL tutors.</p><p>In relation to the provision of ISL interpreters in schools, I wish to advise that my Department&rsquo;s Circulars 0071/2011 and 0030/2014 specifically restated the role of the SNA to ensure that it includes the necessary duties that are required to support the care needs of deaf and hard of hearing students, including in relation to the provision of ISL support and assistance.</p><p>The mechanism for the provision of communication support for children who are deaf or hard of hearing in schools is therefore provided through the SNA scheme.</p><p>Circular 0030/14, states that when SNA support is allocated to schools to cater for the needs of deaf or hard of hearing students, the schools should ensure that SNAs who work with deaf and hard of hearing children are equipped with the skills necessary to support the particular needs of these pupils, including capacity to use Sign Language where required.</p><p>It also states that where existing SNA staff are required to be trained to provide Sign Language or specialist training to assist in the provision of support for children with a specific sensory impairment, schools should ensure that the most senior SNA staff in the school are the staff that are trained in order to avoid a situation where staff trained in specialist skills may leave the school due to a reduction in the overall level of SNA support allocated to a school in future years.</p><p>I can advise, however, that my Department has received correspondence from three primary schools who have sought additional funding for Irish Sign Language communication, or interpretation, support for children who are deaf or hearing impaired, outside of the SNA scheme, on the grounds that resources under the terms of SNA Circular, 0030/2014, could not be accessed to provide SNA support with competence in ISL, as there was already surplus SNA support, but no existing ISL support available in the schools.  </p><p>As an exceptional measure, a time-bound communication grant was recommended for two schools to provide ISL support, which will allow the schools to provide for the pupils' current learning needs, as well as allowing the schools time and in-school expertise to develop its capacity to provide for the pupil&rsquo;s ongoing needs in school.  These grants were made for the provision of one additional staffing post at each of the schools concerned, while the actual number of hours to be worked and the employment contract is a matter between the schools and the employees.</p><p>In relation to the third application for support, the NCSE has allocated additional SNA support to the third school to support the care needs of the children involved.</p><p>I am satisfied that the totality of the resources being provided within the education system can ensure that all pupils who are deaf or hard of hearing can partake in education and be supported in our school system. </p></reply>

In the case of ETB schools, vetting of such persons was conducted via the relevant ETB. </p>  <p>  Garda vetting procedures were placed on a statutory basis in April 2016 with the commencement, by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, of the relevant provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016.  </p>  <p>  At the same time, I separately commenced the vetting related provisions of the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act, 2015 which put the Teaching Council&rsquo;s role in the vetting of teachers on a statutory basis.  The Teaching Council (Amendment) Act, 2015 has also enabled the Teaching Council to put in place a streamlined mechanism that allows school employers to meet the statutory vetting requirements in respect of registered teachers in a timely and efficient manner.  However, in accordance with its statutory remit in respect of the teaching profession, the Council&rsquo;s role in respect of vetting applies to teachers only.  As SNAs are not registered teachers, the Teaching Council has no role in relation to their Garda vetting. </p>  <p>  Under the new statutory vetting procedures, the relevant diocesan office or school management body continues to be recognised as the relevant conduit organisation for the vetting of SNAs and other non-teaching staff employed by schools and in the case of ETB schools the relevant ETB also continues to be the relevant organisation for such vetting.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the employer to formally notify the employee of the redundancy in line with the process as set out in Circular 0035/2016.</p><p>The supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed.  These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement.  As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.</p><p>Circular 35/2016 details the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 16/17 school year and also outlines that where a school/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours/posts, then that additional allocation of hours/posts must be offered to any existing part-time SNAs in that employment, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to recruitment.  This circular builds on the introduction of a supplementary assignment panel process for SNAs which was introduced three years ago, giving SNAs the alternative of redeployment instead of redundancy, giving SNAs greater stability and a better chance of a full-hours contract. </p><p>The purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.  Furthermore, it means that, before an employer opts to recruit a further person as an SNA(s), they must ensure that all existing part-time SNAs in their employment, in order of seniority, have been offered a full-time position in the school or, in the case of ETBs, a full-time position in a school within the ETB scheme.  This does not prevent any person from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>An annual review of the operation of the supplementary assignment arrangements is conducted in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager, the Department, school Managerial Authorities and the Unions with a view to making any amendments deemed necessary to improve upon the operation of these arrangements. </p><p>The terms and conditions of employment of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (IMPACT and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005.  The agreement reached between the parties found expression in the two circular letters issued in 2005 detailing the contracts of employment for SNAs.</p><p>Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:</p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary) <i></i>. </p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15/05 (Primary) <i></i>.</p><p>This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs.  These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time.</p></reply>

The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at: <i>www.education.ie</i>, in order that students who have care  needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.</p><p>Where a school wishes to appeal the SNA support allocation which has been made to them, they may do so through the NCSE appeal process, details of which are set out at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.

Also, in keeping with the recommendation of the Focused Policy Assessment, the Government also agreed that the SNA scheme would be comprehensively assessed.</p><p>In line with the provisions of Section 20(j) of the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004, I have requested the NCSE to lead a comprehensive assessment of the SNA scheme, in consultation with other relevant Departments and State Agencies, including the National Disability Authority (NDA).  My officials have also asked the NCSE to ensure that bodies representing the interests of SNAs are also fully consulted in this process.</p><p>The NCSE has already commenced work in preparation for the assessment and it is expected that with the necessary research and comprehensive consultation it is envisaged that the review would be substantially finalised by the summer of 2017. </p><p>As the question to which the Deputy refers relates to an individual child, the matter has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

During the 2015/16 school year in the region of 114,000 children, including some 10,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million km annually.  In general, children with special educational needs are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest recognised  mainstream or special school that is or can be resourced, to meet their special  educational needs under Department of Education and Skills criteria.  Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENO).  In this case, it has been reported that the school referred to by Deputy does not represent the nearest school to the home of the child referred to by the Deputy that is or can be resourced to meet his special educational needs under Department of Education and Skills criteria.  The child mentioned in this case is therefore not eligible for school transport or school transport grant to the school referred to under the terms of the school  transport scheme.  The terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs are applied equitably on a national basis.</p></reply>

Under Section 24(3) of the Education Act, the Minister is authorised, in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to determine the terms and conditions of employment for teachers, and other staff of a school, who are paid out of monies provided by the Oireachtas.  The Minister has the authority to set the rates of pay in the first instance and determine the qualifying criteria to be applied in order to obtain a particular rate of pay.</p><p>A number of Budget decisions were taken in recent years in relation to the pay of teachers and public servants generally due to the worsening financial circumstances of the State. Circulars 70/2011 and 0003/2012 set out the position regarding qualification allowances pending the completion of the public service wide review of allowances.  Circular 70/2011 which issued on 16 December 2011 stated:</p><blockquote>&ldquo;<i>Existing teachers will not be paid any additional allowance where they acquire any further qualification on or after 5 December 2011.</i><br /><br /><i>The position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the public service-wide review of allowances announced in Budget 2012 which is to be led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.&rdquo;</i></blockquote><p>Circular 0003/2012 which issued on 31 January 2012 stated: </p><blockquote>&ldquo;<i>Pending the outcome of the review by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries; i.e. those who become eligible for receipt of the allowance in question on or after 1 February 2012.&rdquo;</i></blockquote><p>In light of these two circulars those teachers who were actively undertaking courses on 5 December 2011 should have had no expectation that they would receive an additional qualification allowance on completion of that course of study.</p><p>Following the completion of the review of allowances, Department of Education and Skills issued Circular 0008/2013 on 25 January 2013.  Paragraph 12 of Circular 0008/2013 states:-</p><blockquote>&ldquo;<i>[W]hereas at 5 December 2011, a teacher in employment on that date and eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of the post they held on that date, was actively undertaking a course of further study leading to an additional qualification, provided that the teacher does not cease to be a registered student on that course before its completion. Such individuals may apply to the Department/VEC as appropriate for a derogation from the general position within 3 months of the date of receipt of the award.&rdquo;</i></blockquote><p>Thus an exception was put in place for those teachers who were actively undertaking a course on 5 December 2011, in employment on that date and who did not cease to be a registered student on that course before its completion .</p></reply>

Globally, supercomputers are playing an ever increasing and critically important role in a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields of relevance to cloud technologies, big data, materials research, healthcare, climate research, weather forecasting, oil and gas exploration amongst others. </p><p>Ireland is committed to establishing a world-class research environment characterised by world-class research outputs, populated by researchers of excellence working within a world-class research infrastructure. Ensuring access to high performance computing (HPC) for computational scientists is integral to the achievement of this overall vision.</p><p>Recent data from our higher education system shows that as a whole it has performed very strongly in recent years in terms of graduate output from ICT related programmes.  Eurostat data for 2012 shows Ireland as having the highest percentage of students studying science, maths and computing in the EU. Since 2012, ICT graduate numbers have continued to increase with output from ICT related programmes at levels 8 to 10 increasing from 2,362 in 2012 to 3,341 in 2014.</p><p>The Irish Centre for High-End Computing (ICHEC) is the national High-Performance Computing Centre in Ireland. Established in 2005, ICHEC operates the national HPC service providing computer resources and software expertise for the research community through collaborative partnerships and programmes of education.  Other universities, such as Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin and the Tyndall National Institute at University College Cork also possess HPC expertise and facilities.</p><p>Following a national review in 2012 of HPC facilities and capacity in Ireland and following consideration of the resulting report, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation agreed that they would jointly provide core funding to ICHEC to enable it to continue to provide this important service nationally.  The joint-funding from both Departments amounted to &euro;1.4 million annually over the period 2013 to 2015 - &euro;700,000 from each Department.  For 2016 both Departments agreed to increase their level of funding to a total allocation of &euro;1.8 million, and will increase to &euro;2 million in 2017.</p><p>A summary of the joint DJEI- DES funding made to ICHEC since 2013 is as follows:<table><tr><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;1.4m</td><td>&euro;1.4m</td><td>&euro;1.4m</td><td>&euro;1.8m</td><td>&euro;6m</td></tr></table></p><p>The core funding provided by the two Departments leverages approximately twice this funding in competitive awards from agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, from industry and from EU research programmes.</p><p>In addition to this funding, and under its Research Infrastructure Call, Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) provided funding of &euro;3.7 million towards the purchase of a new supercomputer for ICHEC. This funding was made to ICHEC in 2013.  I understand that ICHEC has submitted an application for additional capital investment in HPC facilities under a recent SFI Research Infrastructure Call and that its application is in the final stages of review.</p><p>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is presently evaluating continued membership of the European PRACE HPC programme, which would enable Irish Researchers to access the biggest HPC systems in Europe on a competitive basis and access supercomputing and data analysis resources to help drive discoveries and new developments in all areas of science from fundamental research through to applied sciences including mathematics and computer sciences.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in relation to the child, the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, and find that the matter of the appropriateness of an assessment is currently being discussed between the NEPS Cork office and the school in question.  I would advise therefore that the parents of the child concerned maintain contact with the Principal of that school in relation to the product of these discussions.</p></reply>

However, many parents may need advice or assistance to support the transitioning of their child to primary school.  Parents may consult with  teachers, HSE professionals, school principals and special Needs Organisers (SENOs).  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO. Contact details are also available on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>The NCSE website also contains a range of Information Booklets available for parents of children with special educational needs, which are written for parents to answer key questions they may have about the special educational needs of their child.  These include guidelines on Starting School for Parents/Guardians of Children with Special Educational Needs.</p><p>A Collaborative Working framework has been developed by the Education and Health Working Group of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme.  The framework includes guidelines for the child&rsquo;s pathway through key stages of transition in education which can be used by local teams to develop their joint working around transitions.</p><p>These guidelines are set out in flow-chart format and indicate necessary actions from the relevant professionals in health and education required to ensure adequate planning and coordination of the transition processes.</p><p>Health and education professionals and parents should analyse the events and actions with a view to identifying exactly who should be involved at each stage and with whom they should be working in partnership.</p><p>The guidelines are available at .</p><p>There are approximately 14,000 students with ASD in the school system:</p><p>- 63% are educated in mainstream classes,</p><p>- 23% are educated in special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools; and </p><p>- 14% are educated in special schools.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE, through its network of local SENOs, is responsible for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.</p><p>While consideration of professional reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils, rests with the NCSE.</p><p>The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014 which outlines the primary care needs which would be considered significant &ndash; and which might require SNA support.  Approximately 69% of all students with ASD have access to SNA support.</p></reply>

These posts have provided for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhanced the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, made improvements to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and included additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p>  <p>  Circular 12/2016, which is available on my Department's website, outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.  Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.  Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school.  This is an increase on the previous school year whereby the number of release days ranged from 14 to 22 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  The commitments in the Programme for Government, including measures to assist teaching principals, will be considered in the context of the budgetary process.</p></reply>

However it is self-evident that the maintenance and running costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools.</p>  <p>  In general, second level schools are larger than primary schools and have a lower pupil teacher ratio resulting in more classrooms and specialist rooms such as laboratories, workshops and kitchens. This leads to higher unit costs in second level schools for heat, light, power, maintenance and cleaning.</p>  <p>  The standard rate of capitation grant is paid to all primary schools except Gaelscoileanna located outside of Gaeltacht areas which receive an additional &euro;23 per pupil over and above the standard rate grant.</p>  <p>  The Government has just launched the first Action Plan for Education aimed at making the Irish education and training service the best in Europe by 2026.  This plan, which incorporates my Department's Strategy Statement as well as the Action Plan of Education outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented across 2016-2019.  One of the actions as part of the plan is to strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents by restoring capitation funding over a three-year period as resources permit.  This may also provide opportunities for addressing any equalisation issues in relation to capitation funding.</p></reply>

Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person.  This includes provision for students learning through Irish Sign Language.</p>  <p>  A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement Irish Sign Language in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include:</p>  <p>- the special schools for the deaf in Cabra, Dublin have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class. </p>  <p>- funding is available for training of teachers in Irish Sign Language.</p>  <p>- Irish Sign Language weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language for the deaf children and pupils, their siblings and parents.</p>  <p>  My Department, through the Higher Education Authority, has established and fully funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for Irish Sign Language English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies.  The course modules include issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language.  The course is delivered in seminar sessions, group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment, a project and course design.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that a number of children are currently receiving ISL tuition from tutors who are highly proficient in ISL by virtue of the fact that they have come from ISL families or communities and have used this language all of their lives, but who do not hold formal qualifications in ISL.</p>  <p>  While Irish Sign Language Tutors are not currently accredited, since the commencement of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, they are included as a specialised post in the Education Sector, as set out in Section 2 of Circular 0052/2013 &ndash; Procedures on Commencement of Section 30 in Recognised Schools, which recognises that a primary degree or equivalent qualification recognised by the Teaching Council in the subject area in question may not be available, giving rise to concerns about the ongoing supply of qualified staff.  There are, therefore, posts, including ISL Tutor posts that can be filled by people with appropriate qualifications or experience without an approved teaching qualification.  These posts have been reclassified as tutor posts and the holders of these posts are not subject to the requirements of Section 30.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published its Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland, which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children, including recommendations relating to ISL provision and setting a minimum level of qualification for ISL tutors should be set by my Department.  Signature, the awarding body for ISL qualifications recommend that an ISL tutor should have, at minimum, a level of ISL that is one grade higher than that of their student.  This policy advice is available on the NCSE's website www.ncse.ie.  My Department will continue to implement the recommendations in conjunction with other Departments and agencies where necessary, subject to the availability of resources.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-27a.713.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092700072#WRQ00500"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that a new Inclusion Support Service within the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is currently being established in order to assist schools in supporting children with special education needs. </p>  <p>  The service will include the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf/hard of hearing and for children who are blind/visually impaired (VTHVI service).</p>  <p>  This change will mean that schools will receive a better and more integrated service from this new Inclusion Support Service. </p>  <p>  I can advise that work is ongoing to transfer these services to the NCSE. It is intended that the Inclusion Support Service will be operational from 2017. It is also intended, however, that the existing services will continue as normal, as the new arrangements are put in place, with as little disruption as possible to service users, as progress is made to transfer these services to the NCSE.</p>  <p>  Pending the development of the new service, children who are deaf or hard of hearing will continue to be supported by the Visiting Teacher Service which is provided by my Department, from the time of referral through to third level education. The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met. This service is available at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels. Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.</p>  <p>  A range of other educational supports to assist children with Hearing Impairment are also in place, including:</p>  <p>  -  Special school and special class placements which have enhanced pupil teacher ratios.</p>  <p>  -  Additional Resource Teaching Support for pupils with Hearing Impairment who are attending mainstream </p>  <p>  -  Special Needs Assistant Support: DES Circulars 0071/2011 and 30/2014 in relation to Special Needs Assistant (SNS) restated the role of the SNA to ensure that it includes the necessary duties that are required to support the care needs of Deaf and hard of hearing students, including in relation to provision of ISL support and assistance.</p>  <p>  -  An Assistive Technology Scheme to provide for necessary specialised equipment in schools.</p>  <p>  -  Funding for an Irish Sign language (ISL) weekly home tuition service through which deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children, pupils, their siblings and parents.</p>  <p>  -  Funding is also made available through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to enable individual teachers and whole school staff to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.</p>  <p>  My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design. </p>  <p>  Sign language is an option in the Leaving Certificate Applied. There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Post-Primary Languages Initiative has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle. The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics. </p>  <p>  Finally, I can advise that the National Council for Special Education has also published a parental information leaflet for parents of children who are Deaf of Hard of Hearing, which provides details of the supports which are available for such children. </p></reply>

The report proposed 4 interim measures to amend the Public Works Contracts (PWCs) &ldquo;In recognition of the changed market and to encourage more realistic pricing of public works projects&hellip;&rdquo; Three of the four measures are proceeding and implementation procedures have now been issued by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).  </p><p>The three changes which all Government bodies are obliged to implement are: </p><p>1. Reducing the level of risk currently being transferred by making the bill of quantities the primary reference document for tender purposes on employer-designed contracts. </p><p>2. Direct tendering of specialist works packages (e.g. Mechanical, Electrical and Lift installations) where specialist works make up a significant proportion of the overall project value or where they have a significant impact on the long term performance of the project. </p><p>3. The inclusion of informal dispute resolution methods to reduce the volume of disputes that are currently being referred to the formal procedures prescribed in the contract. </p><p>In August of this year the Department published Guidance for design teams in the form of Design Team Procedures &ndash; Practice Note 1 which is available on the Departments website.</p><p>Schools and their design teams have been informed that they will now need to assess what needs to be done to bring their project to a tender ready stage in accordance with these changes to the Public Works Contracts. </p><p>When the design team has identified what exactly needs to be updated for their particular project they have been asked to submit a fee proposal to the Department for carrying out this work. </p><p>Once this work is completed and the Design team provide confirmation of same the Department will then revert regarding progression of the project.</p><p>The Department will carefully managing this process with a view to minimising the risk of any delays. </p></reply>

It has increased by 10% in the past two years. </p><p>The investment which is being made to support children with special educational needs is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government. </p><p>The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included where possible and appropriate in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available. </p><p>Children, therefore, have a number of placement options including mainstream placement with support, placement in a special class in a mainstream school or placement in a special class in a special school.</p><p>It should be noted that we now have the highest level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) and Resource Teaching support that we have ever had, as the number of posts which may be allocated to schools in order to support valid applications for children for this provision, in accordance with my Departments criteria, has been increased annually in recent years to meet the actual demand from schools.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced 12,900 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) will be available for allocation to primary and secondary schools for the 2016/17 school year, which is 860 more posts, or a 7% increase, in the number of posts over which were available last year.</p><p>In total the number of SNA posts available has increased by almost 22%, from 10,575 posts available in 2011.</p><p>The number of resource teaching posts which may be allocated to schools has also increased again this year.</p><p>In May of this year, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocated 7,015 Resource Teaching posts to mainstream schools for September 2016, which is an increase of approximately 9% over the number allocated at September 2015.</p><p>In total, 7,452 resource teacher posts will be available for allocation to schools for 2016/17, which represents an increase of 41%, from 5265 posts available in 2011. </p><p>In addition, approximately 150 new Special Classes will be opened for the 2016/17 school year, which means there will be over 1,150 special classes in place, compared to 548 special classes in 2011. </p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it and additional staffing is provided for special schools annually to support additional enrolments.</p><p>The provision which is being made ensures that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p><p>Funding for the provision of special educational needs supports has been increased annually in recent years to meet the demand form schools, to support the assessed needs of children with individual special educational needs, in accordance with my Departments allocation criteria. </p><p>I am therefore satisfied that the provision which is being made in 2016,  of approximately &euro;1.5 billion, will be sufficient to meet demand from schools in 2016, and that this provision has not been curtailed by a cap on hours and staff, given the increases in SNA and resource teaching staff which have been provided to meet actual demand this year.</p><p>I can also confirm that this Government will continue to ensure that the supports required to ensure that all children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education will be provided.</p></reply>

The primary staffing schedule now operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils.  Each 1 point adjustment to the staffing schedule is estimated to cost between 250-300 additional posts, at a cost of circa. &euro;15 million-&euro;18 million.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  My Department's guidance to schools is to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).  Schools are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school.  The most recent statistics are for the 2015/16 school year.  These statistics are available on the Department website.  The national average class size is 24.9 pupils.  However, with over 21,700 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level.</p></reply>

Such schemes also typically involve a rental fee to be paid by the parent.</p>  <p>  There is a School Books Grant Scheme in place that provides assistance for books for students in all recognised primary and post-primary schools within the Free Education Scheme. Under this scheme, my Department provides funding of &euro;15 million annually to all these schools.</p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2014 provided funding of &euro;5 million per annum for three years to support the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools that did not operate such schemes. Under this additional funding, DEIS schools received &euro;150 per child and non-DEIS schools received &euro;100 per child in seed capital to establish book rental schemes.</p>  <p>  Primary schools that were operating book rental schemes prior to 2014 also benefitted from this funding.  These schools received &euro;18 per pupil in mainstream schools and &euro;20 per pupil in DEIS schools over two year period.</p>  <p>  The Government has just launched the first Action Plan for Education aimed at making the Irish education and training service the best in Europe by 2026.  This plan, which incorporates my Department's Strategy Statement as well as the Action Plan of Education outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented across 2016-2019.  One of the actions as part of the plan is to strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents by increasing the financial support for book rental schemes, in order to reduce/eliminate school book costs for parents as resources permit.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p>  <p>  As part of the capital funding supports provided by my Department, funding of 50% is provided to housing authorities for the purchase of &lsquo;Emergency Replacement Mobiles&rsquo;.  A &lsquo;demountable&rsquo; falls into the category of a mobile, as it is not considered to be permanent accommodation in accordance with building standards.  An emergency in this respect is an unanticipated event, such as flood/storm/fire damage, that would render a caravan uninhabitable or dangerous to live in.  Emergency is not where a caravan falls into disrepair over time due to lack of maintenance, as this can be foreseen and preventative action taken by the owner/local authority.  Also, overcrowding is not deemed as an emergency situation, as this is something which should be managed within the housing authority&rsquo;s social housing waiting list or Traveller Accommodation Programme.</p>  <p>  In respect of the case referred to in the Question, Tipperary County Council requested funding from my Department towards the cost of a demountable.  In accordance with the criteria outlined above, my Department recently wrote to the Council confirming that the request was not deemed to be an emergency situation and therefore did not meet the criteria for funding support, and advised the Council to consider a more permanent solution to meeting this family&rsquo;s accommodation needs &ndash; this would include, such as mentioned above, responding through the normal social housing process or through Traveller-specific accommodation within the Traveller Accommodation Programme.</p></reply>

Local authorities are responsible for submitting valid LAMTR applications to my Department and all applications received were approved.</p><p>In addition, to date in 2016, 27 LAMTR cases have been received and approved and a further 10 claims have been received from Dublin City Council and are currently being processed by my Department.</p><p>In relation to activity under the AHB Mortgage to Rent scheme which was introduced in 2012, up to the end of Quarter 2 2016, a total of 3,432 cases had been submitted. Of the 3,432 cases submitted, 2,593 were ineligible or terminated during the process, for a variety of reasons. Agreement on the sale could not be agreed in a further 76 cases. Of the remaining cases submitted, 675 are actively being progressed and 164 have been completed.  Participation in the scheme is open to any AHB that has expressed an interest in the scheme and signed up to the <i>Voluntary Regulation Code: Building for the Future - A Voluntary Regulation Code For Approved Housing Bodies in Ireland. </i>A panel of such AHBs has been established by the Housing Agency which administers the MTR scheme. The AHBs that are currently operating the scheme are Oaklee Housing Trust, Tuath Housing Association, Cl&uacute;id Housing Association, North and East Housing Association, Respond! Housing Association, Tint&eacute;an Housing Association and Carbery Housing Association.</p><p>Further statistical information relating to the Scheme since its inception, including AHB activity, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website: <i>www.housingagency.ie/Our-Services/Housing-Supply-Services/Mortgage-to-Rent.aspx</i>.</p></reply>

The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting the annual budget and authorising borrowing, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.</p>  <p>  Sligo County Council&rsquo;s financial position is a matter of serious concern.  While it is the responsibility of individual local authorities to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner, my Department has been in regular consultation with the Council in relation to its financial position, resulting in the agreement of a long - term financial plan in December 2015.  Further discussions have taken place between my Department and the Council during 2016 regarding the expenditure saving targets set out in the financial plan, including a meeting held on 7 September 2016 at which the Council supplied details of a number of issues associated with the advancement of the plan targets.</p>  <p>  On 21 September 2016, I met with a delegation on behalf of the Council, including the Cathaoirleach and the Chief Executive; at the meeting, the Council provided a statement of their current position which included requests concerning financial and staff resources.  It was agreed at the meeting that the Council will now prepare and submit for consideration a detailed formal outline of issues affecting the implementation of its financial plan, and the associated financial impacts, which, once received, my Department will consider carefully.</p></reply>

The draft register is published on 1 November each year and is generally available for examination at post offices, Garda stations and local authority offices and on-line at <i>www.checktheregister.ie</i>up to 25 November.  In support of activity by local authorities in preparing the 2017-2018 register of electors my Department will , during November, promote greater awareness of the register through promotional posters, newspaper advertisements and on-line and social-media campaigns.  People will be invited in this campaign to check the draft register during November to make sure that they are correctly registered and to bring errors or omissions in the draft to the attention of the local authority.</p><p>A person who becomes an Irish citizen is entitled under the Electoral Act 1992 to be registered as a D&aacute;il, Presidential or European elector in a constituency if he or she has reached the age of 18 and was on the qualifying date &ndash; 1 September in the year prior to the register coming into force &ndash; an Irish citizen ordinarily resident in that constituency.  The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2015 provided for amendment of the Electoral Act 1992 to enable persons who become Irish citizens after the qualifying date for the register of electors to apply for entry in the supplement to the register of electors.  They no longer have to wait until the following register is being prepared.</p><p>My Department works closely with the Citizenship Division of the Department of Justice and Equality to arrange for the provision of information leaflets about voter registration to new Irish citizens.  These leaflets, which are included in the information pack that every new Irish citizen receives at their citizenship ceremony, detail the steps required to change citizenship status on the register of electors.  My Department has supplied 7,000 such information leaflets to cover citizenship ceremonies in 2016.</p></reply>

The arbitration case relating to the second site owner remains to be heard by the Property Arbitrator, the hearing of which is not scheduled to take place until April 2017, due to the Property Arbitrator&rsquo;s caseload.

Therefore the cost of building 20,000 new social housing units would be approximately &euro;4.1 billion and 100,000 houses would be approximately &euro;20.5 billion. For a building programme spread over a number of years, the costs could alter depending on the trends in construction costs over that time.   </p>  <p>In relation to the cost of supporting households in the private rented sector, my Department funds the implementation of a range of social housing programmes delivered at local authority level. The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) directly supports households with the cost of meeting their long-term housing need in the rented sector.  Under HAP, local authorities will make payments, subject to rent limits, on behalf of the HAP recipient directly to the landlord in respect of rent.  The HAP recipient will then pay a rent contribution to the local authority.  The rent contribution is a differential rent &ndash; that is, a rent set by the local authority based on income and the ability to pay.  The cost of providing such support ranges significantly depending on the location of the property and the household type.  Taking the total number of HAP supported households at year end and the full cost of the scheme in 2015 (which includes the cost of payments to landlords as well as the administration of the scheme at local authority level, and the transactional shared service centre operated by Limerick City and County Council), the average annual cost per unit would be &euro;2,537.  However, this is not an accurate reflection of the average cost per unit when account is taken of the phased introduction of units over the course of the year.  A better measure is the annualised cost of the average monthly rent paid to landlords in 2015, which is estimated as &euro;6,804.  The Rent Supplement scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection also supports households with the cost of meeting their housing needs in the rented sector.  Information in relation to the cost of the Rent Supplement scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The latest (2014) estimated average rental income per annum per social house managed by local authorities is approximately &euro;2,500.   </p></reply>

The Local Government Fund historically provided local authorities with finance for funding some of their day-to-day activities, including elements of water services costs, through General Purpose Grant allocations; for non-national roads; and funding for certain local government initiatives.  As a result of the introduction of Local Property Tax and the establishment of Irish Water, the local government funding model has changed considerably and accordingly direct comparisons year on year are not practicable as the removal of water related expenditures previously incurred by local authorities must be recognised.  </p>  <p>  In 2008 &euro;979,228,405 was paid in General Purpose Grants to all Local Authorities.  In 2016, it is anticipated that approximately &euro;453, 300,000 will be paid to Local Authorities in the form of Local Property Tax allocations.  As indicated above, water-related funding, provided to local authorities as part of General Purpose Grants until 2013, is now dealt with separately through Irish Water.   </p></reply>

It was estimated that once off costs for staff redundancies, termination of contracts, transitioning to another model etc. could range from &euro;85 million - &euro;169 million.  In addition, some &euro;1.6 billion additional running and capital costs would arise over the period of the current Irish Water Business Plan to 2021, due to the fact that the efficiencies agreed in the context of that plan would be unlikely to be achieved in a return to a local authority model.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to retaining Irish Water as a single national utility in public ownership responsible for the delivery of water and wastewater services.  To build public confidence in Irish Water, I will be establishing an External Advisory Body which will advise on measures to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water and to give quarterly reports on its performance in relation to its Business Plan to an Oireachtas Committee.</p>  <p>  The Government has established an Expert Commission to make recommendations for the sustainable long-term funding model for the delivery of domestic water and wastewater services by Irish Water.  The Commission will report to a Special Oireachtas Committee and consideration of recommendations on the funding model will ultimately be voted upon by the Oireachtas next year. </p>  <p>  If domestic water charges were abolished, Irish Water and the Group Water sector would require additional funding to substitute for the loss of revenue from domestic customers.  The estimated additional revenue requirement in 2017 alone would be &euro;240.5 million.  The redeployment of the Water Conservation Grant as subvention to Irish Water would provide savings of &euro;110 million to offset these additional costs. </p></reply>

The BTEA scheme has been amended in recent years to ensure that the conditions are in line with the qualifying payment.  From 2016/17 academic year, BTEA participants with eligibility based on jobseekers, transitional jobseekers or one parent family payments who engage in part-time work will be assessed in accordance with their primary payment.  This measure ensures that only participants who continue to satisfy the means test of their primary payment or another qualifying BTEA payment will continue to receive income support under BTEA.  This will help to ensure that resources are directed at those most in need of assistance.</p>  <p>  This amendment was introduced following a review carried out on employment supports schemes in 2012.  Stakeholders were also afforded an opportunity to contribute to the proposed recommendations at that time.  </p>  <p>  The BTEA operational guidelines were revised and communicated throughout my Department and to external stakeholders in April 2016.  It is important to note that the BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third-level education system.  The student universal support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education. </p>  <p>  Overall, the priority for my Department is that the BTEA scheme will be focused, targeted and suitable for the needs of jobseekers and of the future skills needs of the economy.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving.  This allowed the Department to protect other social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure including help with funeral and burial expenses which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment.  An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the bereavement grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are over 55,000 families with almost 123,000 children in receipt of FIS, an increase of over 70 per cent since 2011.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;410 million, an increase of around &euro;60 million on last year. </p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996.  It is important that FIS does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment. </p>  <p>  Parenting alone is not a qualifying condition of FIS so this information is not maintained for FIS recipients.  Furthermore as FIS administrative data does not record information on recipients working below 19 hours per week, it is not possible to estimate the costs associated with this measure.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 421,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  Disablement benefit is not means-tested and is based on a person&rsquo;s PRSI record.  People in receipt of disablement benefit and who are considered permanently incapable of work as a result of an occupational accident can apply for Incapacity Supplement which is a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a recipient of a social welfare or health service executive payment who has exceptional essential heating costs due to ill health or infirmity and who cannot provide for such costs from within his or her own resources may qualify for a heating supplement.  There is no standard rate for a heating supplement.  Each case is examined on its merits and the Community Welfare Officer determines the amount to be paid taking account of the level of the expenses in question and the ability of the applicant to contribute towards his or her exceptional heating costs.</p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on these issues and in moving forward the actions agreed in the Energy Affordability Strategy.  In that regard, the Better Energy Homes scheme provides support towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance would have to be considered in the overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date, 15 on-site inspections have been carried out at provider locations around the country (8 at Turas Nua service delivery locations and 7 at Seetec service delivery locations).  The inspections cover a variety of subjects such as service delivery, suitability and standard of accommodation, staffing, signage, Irish language compliance, complaints procedures and client feedback.  Regular inspections will be conducted for the duration of the JobPath contract. Inspections may be notified or un-notified and may be general or focused on specific matters of interest.  </p>  <p>  Separately the Department has commissioned customers satisfaction research the results which will be available by the end of the year.  This research will provide a, quantitative, evaluation of the standard of service delivery provided by the Jobpath providers.</p>  <p>  The JobPath providers are registered with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and are subject to the provisions of data protection legislation.  The providers are obliged to observe the principles of data protection, which requires that personal data is used solely for the purposes for which it is collected.  Any breach or suspected breach of the data protection legislation will be a matter for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Applicants who are under age 66, including those with learning disabilities, must be in receipt of a qualifying payment in order to qualify for the scheme.  The qualifying payments for those aged under 66 are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.  Free travel is provided for people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance to facilitate their caring role and support their social inclusion.</p>  <p>  Children with disabilities may qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  This is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 to the carer of a child with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs.  On most transport services children under sixteen years of age are charged fares at special concessionary child rates.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to persons who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In addition to its traditional core business, MABS has been developed to provide more targeted services to support mortgage holders in arrears.  Since mid &ndash; 2015, a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS (DMA MABS) service has been established across the MABS network of services.  This service is focusing on post-Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) cases and assisting mortgage holders to assess the extent to which the option on offer from the lender is the best and most sustainable option, and where required, negotiating with the lender on the client&rsquo;s behalf.  To date, 23 full-time and 3 part-time specialist advisors are in place in 25 locations across the country and over 2,500 clients have benefitted from the service. </p>  <p>  MABS has established a national network of Court Mentors to attend relevant Courts nationwide, where repossessions hearings are listed, to provide support to distressed borrowers.</p>  <p>  More recently a new Scheme of Aid and Advice for Borrowers in Home Mortgage Arrears has been put in place to assist people who are insolvent and in serious mortgage arrears on their home, to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice to help them find the best possible solutions, with the key priority being to support families to remain in their own homes. </p>  <p>  MABS is the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; point of information and guidance for homeowners in arrears and all applications for aid and advice under the scheme must go through MABS.</p>  <p>  It is recommended that the person concerned contact their local MABS for advice and support.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition, the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD), introduced in Budget 2015, is very effective in further improving the work incentives for people with children.</p><p>The ESRI Report &ldquo;Making Work Pay More: Recent Initiatives&rdquo; found that the majority of jobseekers have a strong financial incentive to take up employment.  The analysis shows that almost 80% of jobseekers would see their income increase by at least 40% on taking up employment and six out of ten would double their income.  In addition they find that, of the small number of people who would be better off on welfare than in work, close to five out of six still chose to work.</p><p>The Government recognises, however, that additional efforts are needed.  The Programme for Government contains commitments to improve the take-home pay of families on low-incomes.  One of the most significant is the proposed &lsquo;Working Family Payment&rsquo; targeted at low-income families.  Over the course of the next four months, we will develop proposals for the new payment.  In doing so, we will be guided by two principles.  First, that it should ensure that work pays and that no family is better off on welfare than at work, and second, though equally important, that it has a positive effect on child poverty.</p><p>Making Work Pay cannot just be about welfare payments and top-ups.  It also has to tackle low pay.  The Programme for Government also commits to supporting an increase in the minimum wage.  The Government will also strengthen the role of the Low Pay Commission to examine the gender pay gap and strengthen regulations on precarious work.</p><p>The ESRI report found that in the first year of the BTWFD the proportion of families with children facing a replacement rate of over 70% fell from 39% to 32%.  They also find that the BTWFD results in the proportion of jobseekers that would be financially better off not working decreases from 1 in 15 to 1 in 20. </p><p>It is therefore clear that work pays with more than 100,000 additional people now at work and unemployment has fallen by over a third since the peak of the crisis.</p><p>In respect of people with disabilities the Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities sets out a ten year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities, who could and want to work, are supported and enabled to do so.  Strand 3 of the Strategy, which my Department is leading [and which my colleague Minister McGrath is progressing], sets out the work programme which addresses many of these issues. </p><p>Under Strand 3 of the Strategy an interdepartmental group has been set up under an independent chair, Professor Frances Ruane, to prepare and submit a report to Government by the end of this year. </p><p>The interdepartmental group is examining the interaction between: </p><p>-  social welfare income supports (including secondary benefits), </p><p>-  the tax system </p><p>-  other supports (including the medical card) and </p><p>-  net income from employment. </p><p>In addition, the group will identify any significant disincentives for people with disabilities in taking up or in returning to work and make recommendations accordingly; the analysis will include consideration of options around ensuring that people with disabilities have a streamlined way to resume their disability payment and other supports, in the event that there is a deterioration in their condition or that they have to leave the job.  The group has been charged with ensuring that options recommended are fully aligned with the &ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo; labour market activation agenda. </p><p>I am confident these measures will help to ensure that work pays for low-income families, those with a disability and others that may otherwise face financial disincentives in moving into employment.</p></reply>

In cases where the family unit has broken down these obligations continue to apply and relevant maintenance payments can be arranged either privately or through D/JE supports like the Family Mediation Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts.  The arrangement of maintenance is therefore a matter between both parents regardless of whether or not either parent is in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  The liability to maintain family provisions, contained in social welfare legislation, are separate to, and do not negate or supersede parents&rsquo; obligations under Family Law.  Where a lone parent is in receipt of OFP, the liability to maintain family provisions provide the Department of Social Protection with a legislative basis to carry out an assessment against the other parent and issue a Determination Order for them to pay a contribution either to the Department or the lone parent.  The Department is not arranging maintenance but is ensuring, where possible, that as OFP is in payment that the other parent makes a financial contribution either to the Department or the lone parent.</p>  <p>  Where the OFP payment ceases (e.g. the lone parent transitions from OFP to another social welfare payment as a result of the age of their youngest child or the lone parent finds employment and is no longer entitled to OFP), and the Department had successfully arranged a contribution from the other parent (which only occurs in less than 8% of cases), the Department must inform the other parent that his/her liability to the Department has ceased.

The research showed that the average costs of the diets supplemented under the scheme could be met from within one third of the current rate of personal social welfare payments.

This measure ensured that nobody was immediately worse off by the closure of the scheme. </p><p>There are currently some 3,500 recipients of diet supplement.

FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants.  There are over 55,000 families with almost 123,000 children in receipt of FIS.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;410 million. </p>  <p>  FIS is calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the weekly family income of the person(s) raising the children.  Increasing the multiplier for calculation of the rate of FIS payable from 60% to 75% would result in increased expenditure of approximately &euro;101 million. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996.  As FIS administrative data does not record information on recipients working below 19 hours per week, it is not possible to estimate the costs associated with this measure.  However, further reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; threshold would obviously have increased expenditure implications.  </p></reply>

The payment these contributions allow workers to build up entitlements to benefits if and when certain contingencies arise in the future.  This underpins the funding of the social insurance system as contributions paid in in a particular year are used to fund benefits paid out.  </p>  <p>  People in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are not in insurable employment or self-employment (unless they are working outside the home).  PRSI contributions are not and never have been charged on social welfare payments.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide a cost as sought by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  Recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance may however maintain their social insurance record through the award of credited contributions.</p>  <p>  Credited contributions, normally known as credits, are awarded to recipients of carer&rsquo;s benefit and of carer&rsquo;s allowance where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Recipients of these payments qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the previous two years or have had credited contributions in that period.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid carer&rsquo;s leave from work.  </p>  <p>  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the homemaker scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for state pension (contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis (subject to a maximum of 20 years) are disregarded when calculating the state pension (contributory) rate of payment. </p>  <p>  My priority is to make progress on the commitment in our Programme regarding the level of support for carers, subject to the resources available. </p></reply>

It provides the framework for sustainable development globally, with universal application.  Given its universal nature, Ireland&rsquo;s implementation will not be confined to the work of our overseas development assistance programme, but will also require action to ensure domestic implementation of the SDGs.  </p>  <p>  Like many of our EU partners, we are considering the most appropriate institutional framework to support implementation of the new agenda.  My Department is engaging with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to establish the most appropriate institutional arrangements for implementation, monitoring and review of the SDGs at national, regional and global levels.  Given that effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda at national level will require a broad and integrated domestic policy response across the economic, social and environmental pillars of sustainable development, the national implementation framework will need to provide for coordinated engagement across Government as well as outreach to a broad group of stakeholders.  This work includes consideration of the adequacy of existing governance mechanisms across Departments, based on the objective of achieving efficiency and effectiveness, coherence and inclusion.  We are also working with the Central Statistics Office which will perform a key role as part of the implementation framework and will support the development of measurable national objectives and indicators that best align with the SDGs.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also working to ensure that Irish Aid, in its programming and policy, supports the achievement of the Goals in developing countries.

We discussed the challenges posed by the UK electorate&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU. During our discussions, the T&aacute;naiste, Minister Murphy and I emphasised key Irish concerns in relation to Northern Ireland, border and citizenship issues; the Common Travel area; and the importance of economic trade and people-to-people relations, while the UK Ministers set out the current state of play with regard to their preparations for an EU exit process.  Secretary of State Davis, together with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire, had recently made some important initial contacts with the Northern Ireland Executive and other stakeholders in Belfast.  We discussed the outcomes of those contacts and I urged prioritisation of the vitally important Northern Ireland dimension in the overall Brexit process, with particular focus on the border but also more widely on sustaining the peace and prosperity so painstakingly built up over recent decades.  We had a useful discussion on the implications of and management arrangements for Brexit.  This process will be difficult and complex and require thorough planning and regular dialogue. Secretary of State Davis expressed his determination that the excellent relations between Ireland and the UK would continue.</p></reply>

She is doing an excellent job, including in chairing the Foreign Affairs Council.  I read President Juncker&rsquo;s reference to a European Foreign Minister less as an institutional proposal than as a plea for all Member States to contribute to a coherent and effective Common Foreign and Security Policy.  No specific proposal has been communicated to the Member States.  Any change in the functions or role of the High Representative would require the agreement of all Member States to Treaty change.

Ireland recognises the need to invest more in conflict resolution using all the instruments available to the EU in an integrated way.  This includes strengthening the Union&rsquo;s ability to engage in peacekeeping and crisis management operations as well as building state and societal capacity on governance, rule of law and human rights.  The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the European Union, of which Ireland is a committed supporter, can play a positive role in contributing to international peace and security in European neighbourhoods.  In that context the EU has been engaged in training and support to the security forces in Mali since early 2013 when the European Training Mission in Mali - EUTM Mali &ndash; was established at the request of the Malian Government and in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2085 (2012). <font color="#004080"> </font>The Mission&rsquo;s mandate includes provision of training and advice on International Humanitarian Law, Human Rights and protection of civilians.<font color="#004080">  </font>EUTM Mali complements French efforts initially through Operation Serval and subsequently through Operation Barkhane to<font color="#004080"> </font>counter<font color="#004080"> </font>Islamist fighters in Mali and the wider Sahel region.  These efforts are further bolstered by UN stabilisation force, MINUSMA, which has also been deployed in Mali since 2013 with an authorised troop ceiling of more than 11,000 military personnel. Ireland has deployed members of the Permanent Defence Forces to EUTM Mali since the Mission was established.  Among EU Members States, the largest current contributors are Belgium with 186 troops and Spain with 116. France contributes 11 Members of its Defence Forces to the Mission.  Ireland&rsquo;s initial contribution to EUTM Mali was 10 members of the Defence Forces.  We agreed to increase the number of members of the Permanent Defence Forces deployed to EUTM Mali as a result of the invocation by France of article 42.7 of the Treaty of the European Union following the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015.  From November 2016 when the Mission reaches full operational capability in terms of its latest mandate Ireland will have 18 personnel in EUTM Mali.  The purpose of deploying the additional Defence Forces personnel is to ensure the continued effectiveness of UN mandated missions.</p></reply>

The programme is implemented by the Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture and has an overall multi-annual budget of &euro;185.5m. Public bodies and non-profit organisations in all 28 member States, accession countries, candidate countries as well as EFTA countries which are party to the EEA agreement can apply for funding. Proposals have not been brought forward by the European Commission for increased funding for the programme, which, like all other EU programmes, has to operate within the tight constraints of the agreed Multi-Annual Financial Framework 2014-20.The Government strongly supports the ideals of the programme. To promote the programme here and to maximise the potential for success of Irish applicants, following a tendering process last year the NGO, The Wheel, was appointed as National Contact Point. The Wheel provides information, training and advice on draft proposals. Since July 2015 it has organised 16 information sessions at various locations throughout the country, most recently at last week&rsquo;s National Ploughing Championships. A dedicated website has also been set up - <i>www.europeforcitizens.ie.</i><i></i>As a result of these efforts, fourteen organisations which had been assisted by The Wheel applied for funding under the March and November 2016 Funding Rounds. I am happy to advise that, so far this year, two of these organisations have been successful, each receiving grants of &euro;100,000 : Smashing Times Theatre Company (Civil Society project) and Holocaust Education Trust (European Remembrance project). Decisions arising from the November Round are awaited. The next Funding Round closes in March 2017.</p><p>I am confident that with ongoing mentoring and support provided by The Wheel that there will be an even larger number of applications made by Irish organisations in the coming years.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to the development of a National Plan on Business and Human Rights to give effect to this commitment and in this regard I was pleased to announce publication of the Working Outline of the Plan in December 2015.  This was the result of extensive consultation with civil society, business and Government Departments.  Following further consultation earlier this year, officials in my Department are currently working to finalise the National Plan.  The text of the Working Outline, as well as the contributions received in the consultation process, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Ireland is not a member of the Inter-Governmental Working Group on Transnational Corporation and other Business Enterprises with respect to human rights, established in the framework of the Human Rights Council, but we are following closely its deliberations.  We share the common EU position that the approach of this Working Group, which has a narrow focus on the elaboration of a legal instrument applicable to transnational corporations only, is flawed in that it fails to take into account that many human rights abuses are committed by domestic enterprises.  This undermines a fundamental tenet of the UN Guiding Principles, which cover all businesses, regardless of whether they operate in one or more countries.</p>  <p>  A further omission is the absence from the Working Group&rsquo;s work plan of any reference to small and medium enterprises.  In many countries these make up the vast number of business enterprises.</p>  <p>  These concerns have been shared by the EU with the Chair of the Working Group and we hope that they will be addressed sufficiently to enable our fuller participation in the process.</p></reply>

The EU has responded to the crisis by adopting a range of initiatives designed to address this mass movement of people, not seen at this level since World War II.  These measures include engaging with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration; agreeing plans to relocate migrants in Italy and Greece across the Union; establishing Operation Sophia to address people smuggling in the Mediterranean, and substantial financial assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants.</p>  <p>  As part of its Migration strategy, EU leaders agreed a deal with Turkey last March.  The core intention of the deal is to break the business model of the people smugglers profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable and to discourage migrants from risking their lives in dangerous sea journeys.  The very substantial reduction in the number of lives lost in the Aegean Sea and the substantial reduction in the number of migrants entering the EU from Turkey since the deal was agreed suggests that it is achieving its aims.  The deal is underpinned by a &euro;3 billion Facility for Refugees in Turkey, to which Ireland is contributing almost &euro;23m.  This Facility aims to support Syrians and other refugees in Turkey by providing them with access to food, shelter, education, and healthcare.</p>  <p>  The EU-Turkey deal is just one aspect of a broad European response to the migration crisis. </p></reply>

It is important that such progress is made in a sustainable and manageable way which strengthens Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in providing humanitarian assistance and contributing to the fight to end global poverty and hunger.</p>  <p>  In the very difficult economic circumstances of recent years, the Government&rsquo;s aim was to stabilise and protect allocations to ODA.  In that period, annual contributions in excess of &euro;600 million were made for ODA.  We also consistently stated that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target once economic conditions allow.  </p>  <p>  As the economic recovery consolidates and strengthens, we have begun to make progress on that commitment.  For 2016, the Government provided a total of over &euro;640 million in ODA, an increase of &euro;40 million, or almost 7% on the 2015 budget allocation.  The 2016 allocation represents the first substantial increase in the aid budget in over seven years and was set to deliver an ODA/GNP percentage target of approximately 0.36%.  However, as final GNP 2016 outturn is now expected to be significantly ahead of the 2016 budget day forecasts the ODA/GNP percentage will inevitably be somewhat lower than projected.   </p>  <p>  Our aim is to continue to make sustainable progress towards the UN target in line with the commitment we have made with our fellow EU member states to collectively reach the 0.7% target by 2030.  </p>  <p>  The 2017 Estimates process is currently in progress, and while final decisions on next year&rsquo;s budget allocation are ultimately a matter for Government, I will be making the strongest possible case for a sustainable increase in the 2017 budget allocation for Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance Programme.</p></reply>

Our Embassy in Washington and Consulates elsewhere in the US are very active in advocating for immigration reform while the issue is also regularly addressed in high level political contacts between Ireland and the US Government.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed the prospects for immigration reform with Vice President Biden during his visit to Ireland in July.  While in Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the Taoiseach and I met President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker Ryan, Senator Schumer and other key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  During these meetings we emphasised the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US and encouraged both Houses of Congress to work on a bipartisan basis towards a comprehensive package of immigration reform measures.</p>  <p>  I availed of my UNGA visit to New York last week to engage with Irish community leaders in the United States and to discuss with them the prospects for achieving immigration reform and to reassure them of the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to provide practical support to assist undocumented Irish citizens.  In addition, Minister of State McHugh met with representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, representing a broad group of Irish centres across the United States, in New York on 20 September.  The meeting was also attended by Senator Billy Lawless.</p>  <p>  The current political environment in the United States is not conducive to achieving the necessary political consensus that would facilitate the advancement in the short term of comprehensive immigration reform in the US Congress.  Nevertheless, the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and our Embassy in Washington, working closely with Irish American community leaders, continue to actively pursue all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform that would be of benefit to our citizens.  While there is little prospect of comprehensive immigration reform being achieved within the lifetime of the current Congress, our Ambassador and Embassy staff are assiduously working with well disposed contacts, on both sides of the political aisle, to prepare the basis for a renewed initiative once a new Administration and Congress have been established in Washington DC.</p></reply>

The guidelines also encourage SMEs to register on<i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>to ensure maximum exposure to tendering opportunities.</p><p>Public works contracts must be awarded on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria.  Different criteria are applied at the pre-qualification stage to those at the award stage with pre-qualification criteria designed to assess the capacity of applicants and tenderers to deliver the project in question.  Their capacity is typically assessed by criteria set out under the EU procurement directives and public works tenders usually include criteria such as economic and financial standing and technical ability, among others.</p><p>The Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) contains an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review.  The CWMF is an online resource which can be accessed on the Construction Procurement website at:<i>.</i>Bodies procuring public works projects must comply with the provisions of the CWMF.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the assessment of a tenderer's financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process because the contracting authority must be reasonably satisfied that a contractor will have the necessary capacity to carry out a contract. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.</p><p>My Department has developed specific national guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects; published as part of the CWMF (Guidance Note 2.3.1.3, Suitability Criteria for Works Contractors Minimum Standards refers. <i></i>).  This guidance note sets out standards under each of the criteria that may be used to assess a contractor's financial standing and technical ability.  In this regard, it is important to point out that there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Such requirements would logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.</p><p>The guidance was developed in consultation with industry at a point where the recession had commenced and took into account reduced capacity generally.  Turnover represents a reasonable indicator of the capacity of a contractor to deliver projects of a particular scale.</p><p>Construction projects require main contractors to manage a significant supply chain and where turnover is lower than recommended levels contracting authorities are entitled to have legitimate concerns over the capacity of a contractor to deliver the project in question.</p><p>Guidance Note GN 2.3.1.3 (page 11) states that for building projects turnover should be set within a range of 75 - 150% of the annualised turnover of the capital value of the contract.  For a straightforward building project of 2 years duration with a capital value of &euro;4m the turnover sought can be as low as &euro;1.5m.  For general civil engineering projects this is reduced to 30 - 60% but rises to 200 - 300% of the annualised turnover of the capital value for complex civil engineering rail projects.  The annualised turnover of the capital value of a project is the capital value divided by the number of years in which expenditure will occur.</p></reply>

These pensions are covered by the Pension Insolvency Payment Scheme (PIPS) which was introduced on 1st February, 2010 to assist the former employees of companies that became insolvent and where their defined benefit pension scheme was in deficit.  Approximately 700 pensioners have been taken on by this Department since the inception of the scheme. They are now pensioners of this Department. Around 170 of these are currently paid by the Payroll Shared Service Centre (PSSC) with the remaining pensioners paid via a contract with a third party, B &amp;amp; E Limited.</p>  <p>  This fixed term 3 year contract with B&amp;E Limited was extended by one year and was due to conclude in September 2016. Given that the contract was scheduled to complete, it was decided to transfer the Waterford Crystal PIPS Payroll administered by B&amp;E to the PSSC.</p>  <p>  The first payment by the PSSC occurred on 22nd September and will cover the period 9th to 22nd of September. Given the transition arrangements involved and to minimise disruption and impact on the approximately 530 pensioners impacted a number of supports have been put in place. In addition to termination payments made to B&amp;E in accordance with their contract, B&amp;E were also retained until the end of November to provide support and advice to those affected by changeover.</p></reply>

In recognition of this changing business environment, the Post Office Network Business Development Group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, was established in 2014 to examine the potential for new and existing Government services that could be transacted through the post office network, and to identify new business opportunities for the network.</p><p>The final report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group, which was published in January of this year, made a number of recommendations to support the future sustainability of post offices. These include recommendations in relation to the renewal of the post office network, and the creation of hubs around which local economic and social activity could revolve. The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.  A number of Working Groups have been established to progress the recommendations, including through the establishment of a Network Renewal Implementation Group, which is being independently chaired by Mr. Kerr.

However, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change both nationally and internationally, with the increased use of electronic communications leading to a decline in core mail volumes year on year.</p>  <p>  The Post Office Network Business Development Group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, was established in 2014 to examine the potential from new and existing Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network, and to identify new business opportunities for the network.</p>  <p>  The final report of the Group, which was published in January of this year, made a number of recommendations to support the future sustainability of the post office network, including network renewal.  A Post Office Network Renewal Implementation Group was established to progress this particular recommendation. The Implementation Group is an independent group chaired by Mr. Kerr and includes representatives of An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union.  The Group has been examining issues such as the number and spatial distribution of Post Offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.</p>  <p>  Some of the issues under consideration are quite complex in nature, but I understand that the Group should be in a position to finalise its work shortly. It is intended that the work of Post Office Network Renewal Implementation Group will be communicated directly to the Board of An Post in the first instance for its consideration.</p></reply>

While no expenditure was incurred on the scheme in 2015, the current Government has included a commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>to support the development of rural towns and villages as one way to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland.</p><p>On 9<sup>th</sup>August this year, I launched the Town and Village Renewal Scheme as part of the Government&rsquo;s programme to support rural development.  I have allocated &euro;10 million in capital funding for the scheme this year. A sum of &euro;380,000 has been made available to each of the 26 counties, as part of this initial phase of this scheme.  Local Authorities, in conjunction with local communities and businesses, have been invited to submit proposals to my Department<b></b>by the end of September for approval.</p><p>The Town and Village Renewal scheme is just one of a range of measures in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>which will support rural development.  Some of the other initiatives which have been announced by my Department recently include:</p><p>- the new 2014-2020 LEADER programme which has a budgetary allocation of &euro;250 million over the lifetime of the programme,</p><p>- a new round of Rural Recreation project funding, with total approvals of &euro;4.5 million to 75 projects across the country,</p><p>- the establishment of a National Taskforce to identify practical measures which can be taken in the short-term to improve Broadband and Mobile Phone Coverage in rural areas,</p><p>- the establishment of two Regional Broadband Action Groups, involving all of the Local Authorities in the country, to prepare for the roll-out of broadband under the National Broadband Plan once contracts are awarded in 2017,</p><p>- the launch of a new round of the REDZ (Rural Economic Development Zone) initiative with &euro;5 million in funding for this year.</p><p>While these initiatives will individually make a contribution to rural development, it is their combined impact, along with other initiatives across Government, which will make a real and sustainable difference to rural Ireland. To ensure a more integrated approach to rural development across Government, my Department has commenced work on the development of an Action Plan for Rural Development.  The Action Plan will act as an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives across Government to support economic and social progress in rural Ireland.  The Action Plan will be published before the end of the year.</p></reply>

These include so-called z-drugs - zopiclone and zaleplon.</p><p>The Act also controls the benzodiazepine phenazepam and a number of new psychoactive substances which Ireland is required to control under our EU and UN obligations, as well as two substances found in the headshop drug &lsquo;Clockwork Orange&rsquo;.</p><p>Controlling the substances in the Act was part one of a two-step process. Regulations and various Orders are also required to allow legitimate users (e.g. patients with a prescription, health professionals) to possess the substances.

The objective of the Redress Board was to provide compensation to women who were former patients of Dr. Michael Neary, who had unnecessary obstetric hysterectomies and also to women under 40 years of age who had unnecessary bilateral oophorectomies, i.e. the removal of both ovaries or a remaining single functioning ovary at the time of obstetric hysterectomy, or as a gynaecological procedure. In each case the surgical procedure would have led to early menopause.  The Redress Board determined that awards were payable in 119 cases. </p>  <p>  Following on from this, the Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme was established on an independent basis in November 2013 in keeping with a commitment in the Programme for Government to make awards to an estimated 35 women over 40 who had a bilateral oophorectomy, or removal of a single functioning ovary, but whose applications were rejected on age grounds alone by the Redress Board.  The Scheme has now concluded and under the Scheme, awards were made to a total of 47 women who met the criteria.  Thirty eight applications were refused under the Scheme, because they did not meet the criteria for awards and another 15 applications were withdrawn. </p>  <p>  The criteria for eligibility under both Schemes were very clear and unfortunately some of the women who had requested consideration of their cases did not meet the criteria for either Scheme.</p>  <p>  My office have no record of a meeting request from the women concerned.  However, the former Minister met with Patient Focus during Summer 2015 concerning a small number of women who were represented by Patient Focus, who did not meet the criteria to receive awards under either of the schemes.  Following this meeting my officials carefully considered this matter in consultation with the State Claims Agency.  Having looked at the cases in question, and the broad range of conditions detailed, despite being sympathetic to the plight of the women, my officials have advised that their procedures were not covered by the terms of the Redress Scheme.  It is of course, open to any woman to seek redress or compensation in the normal way should her legal adviser determine she has a case. </p></reply>

I can confirm that I intend to implement the decisions taken earlier this year to also protect the title of physical therapist. </p>  <p>  I will make regulations under the Act to prescribe the title of  physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist thereby protecting both titles.  I will also amend the Act to facilitate existing users of the title of physical therapist who are not qualified physiotherapists but who are graduates of the Institute of Physical Therapy and Applied Science or who hold equivalent qualifications to continue to use the title.  New and separate grand parenting provisions will be introduced to permit such practitioners to register, together with current students of the Institute who graduate, on a once-off basis and for a limited period, in the physiotherapists register.  It would not be in the public interest to provide for the registration of those with lesser qualifications.</p></reply>

A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicine is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2016 and the Regulations made thereunder, the manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis and certain cannabis-related compounds is currently unlawful except under licence.  However, the scope for such licences to be issued is restricted to a limited number of specific circumstances.  This is in line with the international controls on cannabis as prescribed under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961. </p>  <p>  In July 2014, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988, were amended to allow for a specific cannabis-based medicinal product to be used in Ireland.  This derogation was facilitated based on evidence from scientific data submitted by a company to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of this specific medicine and its ability to provide a clear medical benefit for patients with multiple sclerosis, warranting its authorisation as a medicine and its inclusion as a Schedule 2 controlled drug.  Subsequently the HPRA granted a marketing authorisation for Sativex Oromucosal Spray to be marketed in the State for the relief of symptoms of spasticity for people with multiple sclerosis where other conservative treatments have failed to provide adequate benefits. </p>  <p>  To date, the HPRA has not received any applications for authorisation for any further cannabis-based products, but remains open to doing so.  If other cannabis-based medications come to market, and the marketing authorisation holder seeks to have the product made available in Ireland, it is likely that further legislative changes may be required to accommodate such a product.</p></reply>

Minimum benefit is one of the key principles on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. </p>  <p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women.  By way of example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women). </p>  <p>  The health services and procedures provided by minimum benefit should be viewed as a cohort of procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population, and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.</p></reply>

There has also been an increase of 1,250 nurses employed in the public health service (34,461 to 35,712) from July 2014 to July 2016. </p>  <p>  However, there is an international nursing and medical manpower shortage, leading to difficulties in recruiting nurses, doctors and consultants. This difficulty is being experienced by other English speaking countries including the UK, Australia, and Canada and means there is a competitive international market for health workers. It is important therefore that the terms and conditions of employment of Irish medical professionals are as attractive as possible.  </p>  <p>  The ability of the HSE and the health service to attract and retain high quality frontline staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required. The MacCraith Group, established in 2013 to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures, made a series of recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and planning for future needs. The implementation of the Group's recommendations is being actively pursued and monitored. </p>  <p>  The HSE is focused on offering graduating nurses and midwives permanent posts and on replacing agency staff with permanent staff. Recruitment of additional nurses is the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals. Recruitment campaigns are underway in Ireland and abroad with a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 available to nurses who return from overseas.. This includes recent and ongoing international, national and local interviewing of General Nurses, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability, Registered Children's Nurses and Midwives. </p></reply>

In line with the National Drugs Strategy, the Health Service Executive has reoriented the addiction services in recent years so that they are capable of dealing with all substances.  The HSE is continuing to develop the spread and range of addiction services to achieve better coverage across the country, especially in areas most affected by the drug problem. Treatment is provided through a network of statutory and non-statutory agencies, using a four tier model of service delivery.  The four tier model is based on the principle that drug treatment is best provided at the lowest level of complexity, matching the patient&rsquo;s needs and as close to the patient&rsquo;s home as possible. </p>  <p>  As the HSE are responsible for the delivery of addiction services I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  </p></reply>

They can be administered as a tablet, capsule or in liquid form. While a doctor may prescribe them to treat specific medical conditions, there is increasing evidence to demonstrate that the misuse of such drugs and their derivatives, for non-medical purposes is increasing and posing significant risk and evidenced harm to human health.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that preliminary figures obtained from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry Scheme (HIPE) indicate that there has been an increase in steroid-related admissions to hospitals.  However, the overall admission rate for steroid-related problems is still relatively low.  </p>  <p>  The issue of steroid use, and the use other image enhancing drugs, has also been highlighted by the needle exchange services as an emerging and growing issue.   However, all staff involved with needle exchange can transfer their current skills set to these groups with respect to harm reduction advice, safe needle use and safe sharps disposal,</p>  <p>  A key priority for me at present is the development of a new National Drugs Strategy to respond to the changing nature of the drug problem.  The provision of resources to support the implementation of the new Strategy, including any initiatives proposed to address illicit steroid usage, will be determined in the context of the estimates process.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is the statutory authority under the Health Act 2007 which is responsible for the inspection, regulation and registration of residential services for children, older people and people with disabilities in Ireland.  HIQA's role is to promote sustainable improvements, safeguard people using health and social care services, support informed decisions on how services are delivered, and promote person centred care for the benefit of the public.  All centre-based residential and residential respite care facilities for adults or children with a disability are subject to registration and inspection by HIQA since 1 November 2013.  Over 1,900 inspections have taken place to date.  The lessons learned from these are continuing to improve the quality of services.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the regulations is to safeguard and support the delivery of person-centred care to people with a disability of any age who are receiving residential care services and to ensure that their health, well-being and quality of life is promoted and protected.  Compliance with HIQA standards is a requirement under the Service Level Arrangements between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and voluntary service providers under Section 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is a scheme of financial support for people who need long term residential care services.</p><p>In line with the legislation there are three main steps to the process.</p><p>- Step 1 is an application for a Care Needs Assessment.  The Care Needs Assessment identifies whether or not the person needs long-term nursing home care.</p><p>- Step 2 is an application for State Support.  This is used to complete the Financial Assessment by the HSE which assesses the person&rsquo;s contribution to care and his/her corresponding level of financial assistance (&ldquo;State Support&rdquo;).  The Financial Assessment takes account of a person&rsquo;s income and assets in order to determine the person&rsquo;s contribution to their care.</p><p>- Step 3 is the decision to approve financial support for the applicant under the scheme.</p><p>As part of the Financial Assessment process, the HSE identifies any income or assets that the applicant and his/her partner may have deprived themselves in the 5 years leading up to their application or at any time on or subsequent to the date on which application for financial support under the scheme is first made.  These are defined in the legislation as 'transferred assets and 'transferred income' and are considered by the HSE when making a determination on the person's contribution towards their care.</p><p>Under the legislation there is no provision  for discretion on the five year rule.</p></reply>

At that meeting, and in the debate on the Private Members Motion on the 19 July 2016, I reaffirmed the Government's commitment in its Programme to providing medical cards to all children that qualify for the DCA.</p>  <p>  I also confirmed that this commitment was a priority for me in the upcoming budget discussions.  Detailed financial analysis is currently being conducted in order to establish as accurately as possible the expected costs to the Exchequer in each case.  Subject to the required resources being secured in the upcoming budget negotiations, primary legislation will be required to give effect to this measure and it is my objective to have this prepared and brought to the Oireachtas as quickly as possible after the Budget.</p></reply>

The Regulations also revise the list of Special Items of Service, which are made available to patients under the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the new Framework, if two practice units are providing general practitioner services in the same qualifying area, both practices may qualify for a modified allowance of &euro;10,000.  GPs holding a permanent GMS contract who received the Rural Practice Allowance of &euro;16,216.07 immediately prior to the introduction of the new Regulations who do not meet the new qualifying criteria continue to receive the payment on a personal basis, provided they retain their contractual commitment to the remote rural area.</p>  <p>  As at 8th September 2016, there are 253 practice units in receipt of rural supports under the RPSF.  175 practices receive the financial allowance of &euro;20,000 and 20 practices receive the modified allowance of &euro;10,000.  The full year cost of increasing the existing allowance to &euro;25,000 and the corresponding modified allowance to &euro;12,500 for these practices would amount to nearly &euro;1 million.  Any increase in the financial allowance under the new RPSF would only apply to those practices that qualify under the new criteria, therefore these calculations have excluded the 58 GPs who currently receive the old financial allowance of &euro;16,216.07.</p>  <p>  Since 2009, a number of reductions have been applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (FEMPI) to the fees and allowances paid to healthcare professionals, including GPs who provide services under the GMS scheme.  The &ldquo;distance code&rdquo; was removed as a factor in calculating GP fees and allowances in 2010 under FEMPI.  Certain fees payable to GPs such as capitation and out of hours fees varied according to a patient's age, gender and distance of their residence from the GP's surgery.</p>  <p>  To accurately cost a reinstatement of the previous "distance code" arrangement would require a detailed exercise by the HSE, which would involve establishing a database for the current population of GMS patients containing their age, gender and distance of their residence from their GP's surgery.  The Primary Care Reimbursement Service, which is responsible for the remuneration of GPs for the range of services they provide under the GMS scheme, does not currently maintain such a database.

In addition, it is in keeping with the objectives of the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel that we should endeavour to establish and promote voluntary principles and practices for the ethical international recruitment of health personnel, taking into account the rights, obligations and expectations of source countries, destination countries, and migrant health personnel.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that a number of our Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs), GPs, and consultants go abroad as part of their training, and some go following completion of their training, to gain experience and expertise, prior to taking up posts in Ireland.  A further cohort go abroad for extended periods, for a variety of other reasons, such as working conditions, lifestyle, and pay.  However, some go abroad and do not return to Ireland.</p>  <p>  In this context, the implementation of the recommendations of the MacCraith Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure Working Group is a priority for both my Department and the HSE.  The Working Group completed its work in June 2014 and, in all, submitted three reports and made 25 recommendations.  The reports address a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish public health system.</p>  <p>  The MacCraith Strategic Review Working Group's recommendations are being implemented through a range of structures and processes across the health system.  Each recommendation has an identified business owner, and progress updates are sought by my Department on a regular basis.  To support implementation of the recommendations, my Department has also established an Implementation Monitoring Group, comprising key stakeholders, including NCHDs.  To date, three progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  These reports allow all stakeholders to assess the progress being made across the range of Strategic Review recommendations.  At this point the focus is on the implementation of these measures, to support retention.</p></reply>

The Strategy recommends that services should be woman-centred and provide integrated, team-based care, with women seeing the most appropriate professional, based on need.  One of the high level priorities of the Strategy is to ensure that women have access to safe, high quality, nationally consistent, woman centred care.  The new model of care will be underpinned by National Clinical Audit and a set of National Clinical Guidelines, quality assured by the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee.</p><p>Responsibility for implementation of the Strategy falls largely to the HSE<i>. </i>The HSE <i>National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme</i>will lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services across primary, community and secondary care, strengthening such services by bringing together work that is currently undertaken across a number of divisions.  It is also envisaged that through the establishment of maternity networks across hospital groups, and the sharing of expertise within those networks, the operational resilience of smaller units will be strengthened and supported to provide safe quality services.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that HIQA is currently finalising <i>National Standards for Better Safer Maternity Services</i>.  I believe that the Strategy and the National Standards will provide the important, and necessary, building blocks for the provision of safe, high quality maternity services into the future.</p><p>Finally, I should mention that, as recommended in the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s report on Portlaoise Hospital, each of our 19 Maternity Units now publishes a Maternity Patient Safety Statement on a monthly basis.  The Maternity Patient Safety Statements provide assurances around the safety and quality of maternity services at individual hospital level.</p></reply>

There will be two changes made to the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule later this year with the introduction of Men B and Rotavirus for all babies born on or after 1 October, 2016.  The HSE is currently working on the necessary preparations for the introduction of these new vaccines.  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  The Men B immunisation programme which is scheduled to start in quarter 4 this year makes Ireland the second country in Europe to make the vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee has made recommendations in relation to a number of &ldquo;at risk groups&rdquo; but not all of these are included in the current immunisation schedule.  The introduction of this vaccine to the childhood immunisation programmes means that all children born on or after 1 October, 2016 will automatically receive the vaccine.  However, there are no plans at this stage to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However, the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.</p></reply>

The study is not complete and has not yet been published. Preliminary results show that 73 - 76% of children living in fluoridated areas show no evidence of dental caries. This compares very well with other European countries and is clear evidence of a substantial improvement in the oral health of children in Ireland. While there are indications that deprivation may be linked to poorer oral health, further work needs to be completed to support this assertion. The Department of Health and the HSE will continue to monitor the findings of the FACCT surveys as they emerge. </p>  <p>  There is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to introduce a preventive dental health package for children under 6. Together with existing dental checks at 6, 9 and 12 years, every child under 12 will be entitled to a comprehensive preventive dental health programme. The National Oral Health Policy, which the Department of Health is currently developing, will inform future provision of dental services. There has been no delay in publishing the policy. This three-year project commenced in 2014 and is due to be completed early in 2017. The project, which is being led by the Chief Dental Officer, includes a needs assessment, a review of resources and involves consultation with stakeholders, including dental professionals and the public. These are matters which I intend to consider in the context of the implementation of the Health commitments in the Programme for Government and having regard to the funding available to facilitate such measures.  Detailed financial analysis will be required in order to establish as accurately as possible the expected costs to the Exchequer in each case.</p></reply>

The focus of this Plan is on those waiting the longest for inpatient or daycase procedures and the HSE is committed to reducing by half, the number of patients waiting over 18 months for this type of procedure. This will be achieved through a combination of strict adherence to chronological scheduling, clinical validation and the implementation of process improvement plans at hospital level.</p>  <p>  The Winter Initiative 2016-2017 includes a &euro;7 million fund for a targeted waiting list programme to reduce the numbers of patients waiting for orthopaedic, spinal and scoliosis procedures in designated sites.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government (PfPG) clearly commits &euro;50 million in 2017 for waiting list initiatives, with at least &euro;15 million of this allocated specifically to the NTPF.

However, the HPSC cautions that provisional data is subject to change and it cannot be assumed that quarterly data yet to be reported will mirror data as reported in previous quarters.</p><p>On foot of concerns about outbreaks of  Multi-Drug resistant Organisms (MDROs) in recent years a National Taskforce on AMR to address the issues of managing and reducing AMR and HCAI was established by the HSE in 2015. The Taskforce's remit is to direct and coordinate an effective system-wide response to the issue of HCAI/AMR. </p><p>The Taskforce is a multi-disciplinary high-level group that supports and advises HSE Divisions on reducing incidences of MDRO through ensuring rational antimicrobial use across all healthcare settings, providing effective diagnostic support for infection, improving professional education, training and public engagement to promote wider understanding of the need for appropriate use of antibiotics, ensuring compliance with the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of HCAI across all healthcare settings and ensuring implementation of national guidelines across all healthcare settings.  </p><p>Ireland also fully supports the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (2015) and recent Council Conclusions on AMR (June 2016).  The Council calls on Member States to have in place before mid-2017 'a national action plan against Antimicrobial resistance based on the 'One Health' approach and in line with the objectives of the WHO Global Action Plan'.  (The 'One Health  ' concept is a worldwide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment). The WHO is working with countries to support the development and implementation of their national plans, and will report progress to the World Health Assembly in 2017. </p><p>Through the Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee, established and co-chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of this Department and the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and endorsed by both respective Ministers, Ireland is addressing the Council's requirement for all Member States to have in place an Intersectoral co-ordination Mechanism to develop a national action plan against AMR to encompass both the human and animal sectors, agriculture and the wider environment. The Committee was launched on European Antibiotic Awareness Day in November 2014 and has a clear role and mandate across the human and animal health sectors. Committee membership consists of representatives of both Departments and of the relevant HSE and veterinary specialist agencies, including other relevant bodies with a remit across the two sectors; membership is representative of major stakeholders. The Committee meets bi-annually and its most recent meeting took place on 13 April 2016.  </p><p>A key action for the Committee's work during 2016 is the development of Ireland's AMR national action plan.  This plan will cover the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as for human health. This work is continuing and the Committee is scheduled to meet again in late 2016 to assess progress on this major agenda item.</p><p>The prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and AMR has been a significant patient safety and public health priority for the Department of Health Ireland for numerous years.  Ireland as a whole is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at international, EU and national levels to this end. </p></reply>

It is clear that the resources available for home supports need to be strengthened and we have committed in the Programme for Government to improving the situation.  As a first step, an additional &euro;40m has been made available for the maintenance and development of home care services to the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  On 9 September the HSE published its Winter Initiative Plan 2016/2017.  The aim of the plan is to focus on specific measures required to address the anticipated surge in health service activity in hospitals and in the community normally associated with this time of year.  The Winter Initiative Plan will begin to take effect from late October/early November 2016.</p>  <p>  One of the key objectives of this year&rsquo;s plan is to reduce the numbers of people waiting to be discharged from hospitals by providing the specific supports and pathways to allow patients to move home or to an alternative suitable community setting which meets their needs.  Achieving this objective will free up beds in the acute hospital system which, in turn, will lead to less overcrowding in Emergency Departments.  Of the &euro;40m additional funding being provided this year, &euro;10m will provide for 950 additional Home Care Packages, with 50 HCPs being provided on a weekly basis over the Winter Initiative period.  These packages will be targeted at 10 specific hospitals where this intervention is most needed.   </p></reply>

This includes an additional sum of &euro;500m which was approved by the Government in July, in recognition of the significant challenges facing the health sector against a backdrop of growing needs.  This additional funding will allow for achievable targets to be set, and it is anticipated that the Health Service will achieve budget compliance - without resort to a Supplementary Estimate - for the first time in a number of years. That said, it is essential that we continue to focus on cost containment, productivity and efficiencies as there continues to be major cost pressures on the health service including an increased and ageing population, an increase in chronic conditions, and new and expensive medicines and technologies.</p>  <p>  The level of funding available for my Department is being considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process for 2017 which is currently underway.

This figure is revised every 5 years when new planting and clearfelling activities are taken into account at that point in time. According to the 2012 NFI, the total area under forestry is 731,650 hectares or 10.5% of the total land surface of Ireland. In order to achieve an increase to 20% forest cover from this level a total of 646,150 hectares of new forestry is required. The cost to the exchequer of planting this area of land with trees, to include both grants and premiums using existing rates and 15 annual premiums, would be  approximately &euro;7.6 billion. This is a straight calculation without adjustments for items such as future inflation or the shadow price of public funds. If this target is to be reached in 20 years and assuming that the same area is planted each year, the annual total level of afforestation would be 32,308 hectares. This compares with 6,293 hectares planted in 2015. The annual cost of an afforestation programme on this scale would be &euro;378.4 million.</p></reply>

In order to address the ongoing difficulties in the Dairy markets at EU and international level, the Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July 2016.  The main component of the package is a fund of &euro;500 million, which in turn comprises two elements:</p>  <p>  - The first is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure to compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (at a rate of 14c/kg). The detailed rules regarding this measure  were agreed at EU level on August 25 and the Commission provided the legal provisions to give effect to this measure earlier this month. The Scheme is currently being implemented in Ireland and some 4,400 milk  producers have applied, indicating that they propose to reduce milk  production by 72m litres in the Oct &ndash; Dec 2016 period over the same period last year.</p>  <p>  - The  second element of the EU July 2016 package, to which the Deputy refers, is  a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of  national envelopes, which each Member State can use in accordance with  their domestic circumstances. Whilst eligibility criteria will apply,  Member States are afforded a large degree of flexibility in terms of the  measures they might adopt.  Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the fund will   be &euro;11.09 million. Member States will be required to notify the Commission  by 1 November 2016 of the measures to be adopted.</p>  <p>  I will consider the question of additional national funding in the context of the overall budgetary process and taking into account the finite resources available and the demands from across the agri food sector.</p></reply>

Following this finding the Department initiated a programme of targeted and systematic surveys for the disease. As the periods of these surveys initially crossed calendar years the results up until December 2015 were not collated on an annualised basis but rather in terms of the increase in confirmed findings from one survey period to another. These figures can be obtained, if the Deputy so wishes, however is not possible to do so in the time available. I would advise the Deputy to consult the Department&rsquo;s website where there is a dedicated section on Ash Dieback and where the findings from each of the surveys undertaken is outlined in detail.  </p>  <p>  The data generated by the initial programme of targeted and systematic surveys for the disease was collated primarily on the basis of the location type rather than the number of confirmed findings by county year on year. These figures too can be obtained, if the Deputy so wishes, however it is not possible to do so in the time available. A national distribution map of all confirmed findings up to the 30th June this year is accessible on the dedicated section of the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In November 2012, legislation was put in place to restrict the movement of ash seeds, plants, or wood into or within the country with a view to preventing the establishment of the disease on the island. In March 2013 the Department introduced a Reconstitution Scheme (Chalara Ash Dieback) to restore forests planted under the afforestation scheme which had suffered from or which were associated with plants affected by disease. To date the Department has supported the uprooting and deep burial of an estimated 2 million plus ash trees. In addition to these measures the removal and destruction of several thousand ash trees has been undertaken in roadside / motorway landscaping plantings, farm landscaping / agri-environment scheme plantings, and commercial nurseries / garden centres.</p>  <p>  In December 2012 the Department delisted ash as a tree species approved under the afforestation grant schemes and shortly thereafter delisted ash from the trees species approved under the agri-environment options scheme (AEOS, now GLAS). The National Roads Authority also agreed in 2013 to suspend the use of ash in any roadside/motorway plantings and since then it uses alternative species. Coillte also made a policy decision not to replant with ash. </p>  <p>  An all-Ireland approach to dealing with Chalara has been maintained under the North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) with ongoing close co-operation in all areas. This included the publication jointly by the then Minister of State with responsibility for forestry Mr. Tom Hayes TD and the then Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms. Michelle O&rsquo;Neill MLA, in July 2013 of an All-Ireland Chalara Control Strategy. </p>  <p>  At this point in time and pending the outcome of national and international research projects to identify ash trees that show strong tolerance to the disease, the Department is not actively supporting the planting of ash trees.  Farmers and other landowners should also be aware that there are regulations in place restricting the movement of ash seeds, plants, or ash wood into or within the country with a view to preventing the spread of the disease. This legislation is in the form of Order (S.I. No. 479 of 2015) made under the Destructive Insects and Pest Acts 1958 and 1991. Similar legislation is in also place in Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  As noted above the  Department operates a Reconstitution Scheme (Chalara Ash Dieback) to restore forests planted under the afforestation scheme which had suffered from or which were associated with plants affected by disease. The scheme provides financial support in the form of grant aid based on costs incurred up to a maximum of &euro;1,500 per hectare for site clearance, up to a maximum of &euro;2,500 per hectare for replanting with conifer and up to a maximum of &euro;3,800 per hectare for replanting with broadleaves, and up to a maximum of &euro;800 and &euro;1,200 per hectare respectively for maintenance of these replanted areas. The Department also operates a Woodland Improvement Scheme to provide financial support in the form of grant aid at a rate of &euro;750 per hectare aimed at encouraging forest owners who have not yet done so to thin their forests with a view to increasing the growth of the better trees in the plantation.  Both schemes are open to forest owners who planted under one of the grant aided afforestation schemes since 1980.</p>  <p>  In addition to the scheme based measures which have resulted in the uprooting of over 2 million trees and replanting of over 755 hectares of forest plantations affected by the disease, the removal and destruction of several thousand ash trees has been undertaken in roadside / motorway landscaping plantings, farm landscaping / agri-environment scheme plantings, and commercial nurseries / garden centres. Advice continues to be provided by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors to foresters in the public and private sectors on the biology of the disease and recognition of symptoms as well as on the procedures around the clearance of affected forest plantations and infected nursery stock. Inspectors also regularly provide briefings for or attend information meetings for landowners and other relevant stakeholders and representative groups such as the IFA, the GAA, and the Ash Society.</p>  <p>  To assist with the Department&rsquo;s efforts forest owners, forest nursery staff, and members of the public are asked to be vigilant for the disease and report (with photographs, if possible) any sites where there are concerns about unusual ill health in ash. To assist with this reporting an All Ireland smartphone &lsquo;App&rsquo;, called TreeCheck, is available which allows members of the public to report suspected cases of disease or insect attack of any tree species. Using a GPS-enabled smartphone the location of the suspect tree may also be recorded by the app to allow a follow-up inspection by Inspectors in the relevant jurisdiction if required. It is hoped that this App will help not only with regard to the early detection of new occurrences of Ash Dieback disease, but also other possible pest and disease outbreaks. </p>  <p>  Initially the findings were in imported ash trees. Later we found the disease in native hedgerows beside infected imported ash trees. We are now finding the disease in native hedgerows where there is no obvious introduced source of infection nearby. In addition over half the recent findings in forest plantations are in ash trees of native Irish origin. There was a large increase in ash dieback findings in 2016. When these developments are coupled with the evidence from Great Britain, where the disease has spread quickly and widely in the natural environment over the same time period, it all paints an unwelcome and unfavourable picture for us in terms of dealing with the spread of this airborne fungal disease. </p>  <p>  The Department is actively supporting a number of research projects into the control and management of the disease, in particular projects with a key long-term focus of developing an ash tree breeding programme to identify trees that show strong tolerance and or resistance to the disease and the genetic basis for tolerance. It is through such programmes that a long term strategy for ash can be identified and supported.  More detail of the research actions the Department has participated in and/or is supporting financially either wholly or in part can be accessed on the dedicated section of the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Department is aware of the importance of the ash to the hurley making business. Analysis undertaken by the Department indicates the basic resource to supply ash for hurley production is still secure for the foreseeable future as there are around 19,000 ha of existing ash plantations in the country. Hurley production supports approximately 400 jobs in rural Ireland through the production of 400,000 hurleys annually. This makes ash hurley production an important and viable industry in creating employment in rural Ireland. As the supply of ash for hurley production both from local sources and from abroad is secure the future of ash hurleys will ultimately depend on the individual choice of those playing the game of hurling. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to support and invest in research and technologies to breed ash for resistance to the disease so as to seek to ensure the long term availability of ash for hurley production. The aim is to develop Irish ash trees with a strong tolerance to the Ash Dieback disease and to get back to planting ash.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture was evidenced by the implementation of the Review&rsquo;s recommendations over the past two budgets.  This has seen a series of positive changes for Irish agriculture, especially in the areas of land mobility and succession, all of which will support the aims of Food Wise 2025 in terms of increasing the productivity of Irish farms.</p><p>The Agri-taxation Review included two recommendations specifically to help address farm income volatility, both of which were introduced in Budget 2015:</p><p>- Retain and enhance &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; by increasing the period from 3 to 5 years, providing more scope for income smoothing within a commodity price cycle.</p><p>- Allow averaging to be availed of where a farmer and/or their spouse receive income from an on-farm diversification trade or profession.</p><p>Of course recent difficult market conditions have brought renewed focus to this issue.  The &lsquo;Programme for a Partnership Government&rsquo; states regarding agri-taxation:<i>&ldquo;We will also investigate taxation measures aimed at supporting farmers through periods of volatility&rdquo;. </i>Consideration of this and the various issues involved is ongoing in the context of Budget 2017 deliberations with my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the large investment in data recording and genomics which have been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area. </p>  <p>  The BDGP has been agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (2014-2020) alongside a number of other schemes. I am conscious of the positive effect that the programme will have on the Irish suckler herd.  It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the Irish suckler herd.  I firmly believe that the scheme will deliver long-term and cumulative positive effects for both suckler farmers participating in the scheme, and farmers who buy the progeny of suckler cows for further finishing.  It is a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of sustainable beef. </p>  <p>  In relation to any possible reopening of the scheme, this will have to be considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the Rural Development Programme and the potential impact both upon the scheme itself and other schemes.  However, it will not be possible to allocate additional resources to the scheme, having regard to the very large financial commitment already made to the BDGP in the Rural Development Programme, and the significant budgetary pressures across the agrifood sector.</p></reply>

This is a national target which means that all farmers have equal access to funds to establish new forests on their land.  Forestry benefits  society as a whole by creating jobs in rural communities and by contributing to a cleaner environment.  It should be noted that one of the largest processors of timber in the country, Masonite, is located in Co. Leitrim.  For landowners and farmers in particular, forestry provides a land use option which will generate a stable income for 15 years in the form of forest premiums.  The removal of the concession whereby farmers can retain their Basic Payment and draw down forestry premium on newly planted land would make it much less attractive for farmers to plant some of their land.</p>  <p>  With regard to new planting, notice of all applications for afforestation are put on the Department&rsquo;s website showing townland, area of site etc.  The Department also publishes notices in local newspapers where applications are made for afforestation in sensitive high-risk areas.</p></reply>

In order to address the ongoing difficulties in the Dairy markets at EU and international level, the Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July 2016.  The main component of the package is a fund of &euro;500 million, which is in turn comprised of two elements:</p>  <p>  The  first is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure to compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (at a rate of 14c/kg).  The detailed rules regarding this measure  were agreed at EU level on August 25 and the Commission provided the legal provisions to give effect to this measure earlier this month.  The Scheme is currently being implemented in Ireland and some 4,400 milk  producers have applied, indicating that they propose to reduce milk production by 72m litres in the Oct &ndash; Dec 2016 period over the same period last year.</p>  <p>  The  second element of the EU July 2016 package, to which the Deputy refers, is  a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of national envelopes, which each Member State can use in accordance with  their domestic circumstances.  Whilst eligibility criteria will apply, Member States are afforded a large degree of flexibility in terms of the  measures they might adopt.  Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the fund will be &euro;11.09 million. Member States will be required to notify the Commission by 1 November 2016 of the measures to be adopted.</p>  <p>  I will consider the question of national co-funding on this latter element in the context of deliberations on budgetary matters and taking into account the pressures across the agri food sectors.</p></reply>

The Commission and Member States have responded with packages of support measures, most recently at the end of July 2016 when, among other measures, a &euro;500 million fund was agreed, with a particular emphasis on the dairy sector.  The package includes a &euro;350 million conditional adjustment aid measure to be implemented by Member States - from which Ireland will receive &euro;11.1m - and a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure to support voluntary reduction in milk production.  Welcome as these measures are, I believe we must continue to deploy any and all available options that might help to mitigate the effects of the market difficulties.  Such options include measures that will help to reduce production costs for farmers.</p>  <p>  As I indicated previously, according to Eurostat, fertiliser is the third most important expenditure item on EU farms, accounting for &euro;19.2bn in 2014.  I believe that appropriate action in this area could be of significant benefit to farmers at this very difficult time, and in addition to the many other measures that have been considered in recent months, I have asked the Commission to consider a temporary suspension of import tariffs on fertilisers.  Commissioner Hogan has raised the issue with Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, Pierre Moscovici, and Internal Market Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska, and has been following up with those colleagues in an effort to secure their agreement to possible changes.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to pursue the matter with the Commission in consultation with my Member State counterparts.</p></reply>

Dairy markets at Irish, EU and international level, have been experiencing difficulties for nearly two years, due to a combination of increased global supply, the effects of the Russian ban on the import of EU products and reduced global demand.  The Commission  responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures provided for under the CAP and in the form of two wider packages of measures, in September 2015 and March 2016. </p>  <p>  The Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July.  The main component is a fund of &euro;500 million, which comprises two elements:</p>  <p>  The first is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure to compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of  2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (at a rate of 14c/kg).  The detailed rules regarding this measure were agreed at EU level on August 25th and the Commission provided the legal provisions to give effect to this  measure earlier this month.  The Scheme is currently being implemented in Ireland and some 4,400 milk producers have applied, indicating that they propose to reduce milk production by 72m litres in the Oct &ndash; Dec 2016  period compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  The second element of the EU July 2016  package is a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of national envelopes, which Member States can use in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  Whilst eligibility criteria will apply, Member States are afforded a large degree of flexibility in terms of the measures they might adopt.  Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the fund will  be &euro;11.09 million.  Member States will be required to notify the Commission by 1 November 2016 of the measures to be adopted.  Final decisions on how Ireland will utilise this latter aid element have not yet been reached and the matter is subject to on going consideration in consultation with the EU and National stakeholders.</p>  <p>  It should be clearly noted that the above represent two distinct and separate policy responses at EU level.  Availing of one element of the package at national level is not conditional on participation in the other measure.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above measures I along with Minister of State Andrew Doyle have been proactive in promoting Irish dairy products around the world in an effort to further diversify our global markets.  Both Minister Doyle and I have just returned from a four-country trade mission to China, Korea, Vietnam and Singapore where promotion of Irish dairy products in these growing markets was a key priority.</p></reply>

The Russian Federation imposed a temporary ban on importation of pigs, pork and reproductive material certified from the EU after 26 January 2014 in response to the discovery of two cases of African Swine Fever in wild boar in Lithuania.  Efforts to make progress in lifting this ban are continuing.</p>  <p>  A more general ban on the importation of agri-food products was imposed by the Russian Federation in August 2014 on countries (including the EU) which had adopted sanctions against Russia in the context of the situation in Ukraine.  Although partially lifted (since 1 June 2016) in respect of imports of beef, poultry and vegetables intended for use in baby food manufacturing, the overall ban remains in place, and on 29 June 2016, the Russian authorities announced a further extension, to 31 December 2017. </p>  <p>  In the context of the ongoing difficulties on EU agricultural markets, all Member States, including Ireland, have consistently urged the European Commission to intensify its contacts with the Russian authorities with a view to lifting these bans, particularly with a view to restoring the trade in live pigs, pork fat, lard and offal.  Commissioner Hogan again indicated at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July that the Commission has been working hard on this issue, but has not been able to make the hoped-for progress to date.  While efforts to secure real engagement from the Russian authorities will continue, the broader task of securing alternative market outlets for EU food products will also be progressed.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015. The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  My Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered and will, if necessary, include additional premises in the formal procurement process where it is evident that services will not be provided by the commercial sector.</p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  Premises within this area will get services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.</p><p>The county breakdown for the National Broadband Plan Intervention is set out in the table below, with the percentage of premises to be covered by the Intervention and through commercial investment also listed. </p><p><table><tr><th>County Name</th><th>Number of Premises Covered by National Broadband Plan Intervention</th><th>% Premises within the NBP Intervention Area</th><th>Number of Premised covered/planned by commercial operators</th><th>% Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>10,555 </td><td>39% </td><td>16,851</td><td>61% </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>24,197 </td><td>57% </td><td>18,175</td><td>43% </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>34,501 </td><td>51% </td><td>33,657</td><td>49% </td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>85,972 </td><td>32% </td><td>181,782</td><td>68% </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>52,004 </td><td>52% </td><td>48,514</td><td>48% </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>8,295 </td><td>1% </td><td>572,053</td><td>99% </td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>62,540 </td><td>47% </td><td>71,275</td><td>53% </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>51,180 </td><td>57% </td><td>38,824</td><td>43% </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>20,536 </td><td>23% </td><td>67,791</td><td>77% </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>22,455 </td><td>47% </td><td>25,317</td><td>53% </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>16,201 </td><td>42% </td><td>22,560</td><td>58% </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>13,326 </td><td>60% </td><td>8,990</td><td>40% </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>33,963 </td><td>35% </td><td>63,698</td><td>65% </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>11,691 </td><td>52% </td><td>10,891</td><td>48% </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>15,129 </td><td>25% </td><td>45,015</td><td>75% </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>50,831 </td><td>60% </td><td>33,336</td><td>40% </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>31,171 </td><td>38% </td><td>51,384</td><td>62% </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>19,551 </td><td>58% </td><td>13,914</td><td>42% </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>17,130 </td><td>47% </td><td>19,587</td><td>53% </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>24,856 </td><td>64% </td><td>14,269</td><td>36% </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>18,605 </td><td>47% </td><td>21,281</td><td>53% </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>41,207 </td><td>49% </td><td>43,368</td><td>51% </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>17,897 </td><td>29% </td><td>43,098</td><td>71% </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>17,814 </td><td>40% </td><td>26,563</td><td>60% </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>39,308 </td><td>49% </td><td>40,202</td><td>51% </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>16,574 </td><td>26% </td><td>46,250</td><td>74% </td></tr><tr><td>Totals: </td><td>757,489 </td><td>32% </td><td>1,578,645</td><td>68%</td></tr></table></p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (&lsquo;PQQ&rsquo;) and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5 July, I announced that my Department has identified that up to 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services.

These schemes have proved successful at incentivising the development of the renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to meet our 40% renewable electricity target, and figures show that in 2015 some 25.3% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In the heating sector, my Department is working on the introduction of a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) to support the deployment of renewable energy in the sector.  The primary aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in heating and to help reach our 12% target by 2020. In 2015 it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet our renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  In 2015, figures indicate 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The White Paper on Energy Policy sets out a vision for transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050.  The Programme for Government also sets out important objectives in the energy sector that build on this vision.  The clear focus of my Department is on implementing the range of actions necessary to meet our energy and climate change targets.</font></p></reply>

In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects.  The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008. I understand that all funds were expended and there are currently no plans to revisit such a scheme.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP) under EU Regulation 1100/2007, which included a closure of commercial fishing for an initial three year period, was approved by the European Commission in 2009.  In accordance with the EU Regulation, all Member States' EMPs are required to be reviewed every three years.  Ireland's EMP and its conservation measures were reviewed in 2012 and again in 2015.  In both instances, the review involved an examination of the latest scientific data and the conservation measures, the results of which were provided to stakeholders in a comprehensive public consultation process.</p>  <p>  Based on management advice from Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) and having considered all aspects of the 2015 review reports, the existing conservation measures in Ireland&rsquo;s EMP remain in place up to mid-2018 at which time a further review is required.  IFI have been provided funding for a new collaborative research initiative involving IFI scientists and a number of former eel fishermen to further develop national knowledge of the species and its medium to longer term potential for recovery.  This scientific fishery was commenced this year and is expected to continue for three years to increase data and knowledge ahead of further review of eel management measures in 2018.</p>  <p>  The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) for 2016 (published October 2015) is that &ldquo;the status of eel remains critical and that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible.&rdquo;  There is no change in the International scientific perception of the status of the stock as being critically endangered.</p></reply>

Delivery of high speed broadband is a strategic priority under the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  My Department does however continue to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered and will, if necessary, include additional premises in the formal procurement process where it is evident that services will not be provided by the commercial sector.</p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Kerry.</p><p>The maps shows that the majority of Castleisland Co Kerry, falls within the BLUE area  where commercial providers are either currently delivering or previously indicated that they have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  However there are also areas of Castleisland that are within the AMBER area.  The Townland of Moher, Co Kerry falls completely within the AMBER area.</p><p>While I cannot compel any operator to provide services to a particular premises, my Department continues to actively monitor the deployment plans in the BLUE area and direct feedback from consumers is important.  In this regard, if customers in Castleisland cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie</i>, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.  The Intervention Strategy available at <i></i>sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of <i>at least</i>30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload, available 99.95% of the time.  It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand.  Together with other detailed technical specifications, these will ensure that a reliable fast service is available to consumers.  I am satisfied that the speeds are sufficiently high to meet consumer demand, and that any network build will have to be capable of scaling up to meet future demand.  The 30Mbps target will be minimum speed rather than a ceiling for consumers.</p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (&lsquo;PQQ&rsquo;) and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services.  My Department is conducting further analysis to identify these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process.  This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.  Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed draft proposals, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. </p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of qualified bidders and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be &quot;technology neutral&quot; and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology(ies) to be deployed will become clear.</p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Taskforce will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p></reply>

Under this policy, GNI conducts studies to assess towns for connections to the gas network.  In order for any town to be so connected certain economic criteria need to be satisfied, not solely population numbers.  These criteria provide that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network must be recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges.  Uneconomic gas pipeline projects would unfairly increase energy costs for all gas consumers.  In this regard, the 2015 Energy White Paper underlined that new infrastructure proposals will continue to be assessed through robust analysis. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for assessing and approving the GNI Connections Policy, and it concluded its last such approval process in October 2015 following the usual public consultation.</p>  <p>  I have no role in relation to gas connections policy. </p>  <p>  I would also point out that any proposals for extensions of energy infrastructure must have regard to Ireland's policy for transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050, as stated in the Energy White Paper, 2015.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-27a.2409.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092700105#WRYY05000"><p>I am advised that there is currently no provision in the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 or other Irish fisheries legislation to allow for a nominee to fish on a wild oyster dredge licence.  Given the conservation imperative and the need to prosecute the stock responsibly and rationally, the number of licences issued annually in each district is limited to ensure that fishing activity is not intensified.  The number of annual licence applications exceeds the number of available licences in all districts and there are &ldquo;waiting lists&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  In that regard, the issue of licences, by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), is carried out in an objective and equitable manner, subject to established criteria which are published annually.  Principal among these criteria is prioritising applicants based on track record within the fishery.  In cases of genuine hardship, such as illness, an annual applicant should contact their local IFI Office and consideration can be given to preserving an established track record due to short-term inability to use a licence in these circumstances. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive review of the 1959 Act, which is itself a consolidation of legislation dating back to the 1800&rsquo;s and of all subsequent legislation, is underway in my Department.  This review is dealing with a significant array of multidimensional and long standing issues and the primary focus is on ensuring the enactment of modernised, fit for purpose, legislation, which will underpin conservation, protection, development and stakeholders' interests.  </p>  <p>  This is a complex and time-consuming undertaking and it is considered more appropriate to effect required changes comprehensively in the context of consolidating the legislative base for the entire sector rather than attempt to deal with issues in isolation.  Draft heads for a new Bill are expected to be finalised in the first half of 2017.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.</p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  Premises within this area will get services of at least 30mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Dublin. Based on information provided by commercial operators and represented on our broadband map, 89% of the townland of Ticknock, including Ticknock Road, falls within the AMBER area and will be covered by the State Intervention.  The remaining 11% of townland of Ticknock falls within the BLUE area and will be covered by commercial operators.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</i></p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (&lsquo;PQQ&rsquo;) and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises which are currently market BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services. My Department is conducting further analysis to identify these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process. This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.  Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed draft proposals, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. </p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of qualified bidders and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be &quot;technology neutral&quot; and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology(ies) to be deployed will become clear. </p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Taskforce will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.

The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg.  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  There are a variety of reasons for this:</p><p>- Data usage in Ireland has increased by 500% in the last five years; </p><p>- Current 3G and 4G upgrades have resulted in temporary outages in some areas;</p><p>- planning and siting issues for mobile masts and antenna;</p><p>- the performance of individual handsets and particularly smartphones; </p><p>- In-house insulation.</p><p>Any customer, including those in Leitrim, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations. </p><p>My Department understands that operators in the telecommunications sector have invested over &euro;2bn in the last 4 years, in order to modernise networks across Ireland, including significant upgrades to 3G and 4G services.  One operator in particular has also indicated to my Department that it is keen to engage with local communities and councils and address coverage issues at a local level. </p><p>In line with the Programme for Government my colleague, Heather Humphreys and I have established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, which has met twice since its formation in July this year.  This Taskforce is considering immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.</p><p>The Taskforce involves a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecommunications operators.  Measures arising from the Taskforce will be implemented by Government as a matter of priority.  I expect that we will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report. </p><p>Under the Programme for Government Minister Humphreys is also establishing  two regional action groups.  Working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies these groups will  help accelerate the rollout of broadband and mobile telecoms services at local level. </p><p>These new structures at a national and local level, are designed to address as far as possible immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.</p><p>My Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks and this will be a key focus for the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.</p></reply>

The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process.  Premises within this area will get services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to  57% of all premises in Cavan and 58% of all premises in Monaghan are within the Intervention (AMBER) area. </p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015.  This includes over 24,000 premises in Cavan and over 19,500 premises in Monaghan.  On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises which are currently market BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services.  My Department is conducting further analysis to identify these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process.  This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map. </p><p>The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.  Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed draft proposals, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. </p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of qualified bidders and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be &quot;technology neutral&quot; and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology(ies) to be deployed will become clear. </p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Taskforce will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p></reply>

The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg.  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  There are a variety of reasons for this:</p><p>- Data usage in Ireland has increased by 500% in the last five years; </p><p>- Current 3G and 4G upgrades have resulted in temporary outages in some areas;</p><p>- planning and siting issues for mobile masts and antenna;</p><p>- the performance of individual handsets and particularly smartphones; </p><p>- In-house insulation.</p><p>Any customer, including those in border counties such as Cavan and Monaghan, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations. </p><p>My Department understands that operators in the telecommunications sector have invested over &euro;2bn in the last 4 years, in order to modernise networks across Ireland, including significant upgrades to 3G and 4G services.  One operator has indicated that it is in the process of an upgrading its infrastructure in Cavan and Monaghan, with several sites going live over the summer and more to follow in both counties by the end of the year.  An operator in particular has also indicated to my Department that it is keen to engage with local communities and councils to address coverage issues at a local level.</p><p>In line with a Programme for Government commitment, my colleague, Heather Humphreys and I have established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, which has met twice since its formation in July this year.  This Taskforce is considering immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.</p><p>The Taskforce involves a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecommunications operators.  Measures arising from the Taskforce will be implemented by Government as a matter of priority.  I expect that we will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report. </p><p>Under the Programme for Government Minister Humphreys is also establishing  two regional action groups.  Working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies these groups will  help accelerate the rollout of broadband and mobile telecoms services at local level. </p><p>These new structures at a national and local level, are designed to address as far as possible immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.</p><p>My Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks and this will be a key focus for the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-27a.2436.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092700106#WRZZ02400"><p>The passive house standard is a voluntary standard developed by the private sector for new dwellings.  Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings requires EU Member States to ensure that all new buildings (including dwellings) will be nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s current energy performance standard for dwellings under Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) 2011 is recognised by the Global Building Performance Network as being among the leading statutory standards in the world.  The retrofit of existing dwellings to these new build standards is challenging both technically and economically.</p><p>There are very few examples of large scale passive house retrofit projects internationally therefore it is difficult to place a precise estimate on the likely cost of upgrading 10,000 homes in Ireland.  In the Netherlands, one such programme, <i>Energiesprong</i>, has the aim of upgrading 111,000 housing association homes to a carbon neutral standard.  To date, I understand that over 1,000 homes have been upgraded under this programme and the average cost per home is in the region of &euro;70-&euro;80,000. </p><p>It should be noted that the Energiesprong programme applies to a relatively homogenous housing stock of housing association-owned, terraced properties and so the costs associated with upgrading larger and more diverse houses in Ireland is likely to be considerably higher.  In addition, as noted above the Energiesprong only aims at carbon neutrality, a full passive house upgrade would require even more investment.  It would not be unreasonable to estimate an average cost well in excess of &euro;100,000 per home, suggesting a minimum investment requirement of &euro;1 billion to upgrade 10,000 Irish homes to passive house standards.</p><p>As the Energy White Paper notes, the average cost of upgrading a typical dwelling in Ireland to a more modest B on the Building Energy  Rating is &euro;20,000.  Our experience to date with pilots, suggests that improving the Building Energy Rating of an existing home to a higher A3 standard, with energy bills savings of 50% for the householder, can be achieved with a total investment of between &euro;25-&euro;30k.</p><p>It is clear that to deliver this investment and gain the significant reductions in the energy usage of our existing building stock, public funding will need to be leveraged with private investment by homeowners.  My Department continues to explore options to incentivise and encourage deep retrofit models and are supporting demonstration projects, pilots and research in this area.</p></reply>

Sanction for these additional resources was secured for the NTA's budget for 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition the NTA also required a period to make and prepare the necessary regulations provided for under the Act as well as ensure appropriate training and administrative supports are in place to allow for commencement of regulatory activities.</p>  <p>  This very necessary preparatory work is almost complete and my Department is now finalising arrangements with the NTA in relation to an appropriate commencement date. </p>  <p>  Issues relating to clamping allegedly being used by management companies in multi-unit developments to secure payment of management fees are not appropriate to the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015.

They, like all road traffic, are obliged to obey road traffic law.  The measures which were introduced last year to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to issue fixed charge notices to cyclists also apply to pedal-powered rickshaws and provide an important tool for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enforcing the law.</p>  <p>  Mechanically propelled rickshaws when carrying passengers for reward in a public place, come within the definition of 'small public service vehicle' (SPSV) and are prohibited under current SPSV legislation.  Pedal-powered rickshaws do not come within the defintion of 'small public service vehicle' and therefore fall outside the ambit of the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  Therefore, neither the NTA nor my Department currently have powers to regulate pedal-powered rickshaws.</p>  <p>  In response to some concerns - primarily of a safety nature - both Dublin City Council (DCC) and the NTA obtained legal advices in relation to their respective powers to regulate pedal-powered rickshaws.  Discussions have recently taken place between DCC and the NTA who have agreed a proposed approach to regulating pedal-powered rickshaws which would require the drafting and introduction of primary legislation.</p>  <p>  My Department is now engaged with the NTA to clearly frame the policy to guide any detailed legislative drafting, with passenger safety the key focus.  I will consider the legislative proposals which emerge when this work has been progressed.</p></reply>

Currently we have agreement with all jurisdictions where there is significant demand, with the exceptions of the remaining Canadian provinces and the USA.  In the American case, where each State has its own system, the RSA determined some time ago that the complexity of reaching 50 separate agreements, each of which would have to take into account the relations of the State in question to each of the remaining 49, would make agreement challenging.</p></reply>

This assistance takes the form of both PSO subvention funding and considerable investment through capital funding also. </p>  <p>  This totality of Exchequer financial assistance to the transport operators must be considered when reference is being made to the levels of funding provided. While I note the Deputy's comment about a 'European average' I must point out that the different structures and funding sources used in public transport provision across the EU can give rise to difficulties when attempting adequately compare levels of funding in the sector.</p>  <p>  Of course I recognise the need to build upon the increased level of subvention funding I am making available to the NTA this year and that very issue is one I am raising with Ministerial colleagues during this year's budgetary process.

We also want to attract back 70,000 emigrants from aboard.  This is a whole of Government effort and is delivered through our integrated Action Plan for Jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs  process aims to strengthen the enterprise base, support entrepreneurship and start-ups, regain Ireland&rsquo;s lost competitiveness and ensure the potential of the regions for development and job creation through Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Regional is fully realised, supported by competitive regional funds. </p><p>Action Plan for Jobs 2016, the fifth such Plan, was launched in January 2016 and as well as building on reforms in previous years introduces new areas of focus such as: the National Talent Drive which aims to improve the employability of all and ensure that work always pays; and new sources of employment growth such as Energy Innovation, Intellectual Property and Design.</p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs process is working.  Over 176,800 more people are at work since the first plan was launched at the start of 2012 and unemployment has fallen to 8.3% in august 2016. Action Plan for Jobs 2015 commits to 50,000 additional jobs this year.  Good progress is being made with 36,000 additional at work in the first six months of the year. </p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs complements the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work which set outs actions to be taken in support of those that are currently unemployed in order to help them access the labour market and new job opportunities.  In addition, we know that there is demand for a range of skills and experienced professionals across the economy and there are opportunities for overseas talent to be attracted to Ireland, including attracting back our emigrants, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p><p>My Department and agencies, together with other Departments including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have a range of initiatives underway to connect with emigrants and other interested in a career in Ireland. At the end of June 2016, I launched <font color="#2F2F2F">Tech/Life Ireland, a new national initiative to brand Ireland as a top destination to pursue a career in technology.  It is a focused international marketing initiative with a dedicated website, </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">www.techlifeireland.com,</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">to attract talented and experienced tech experts to Ireland and to promote top tech career opportunities here.  Tech/Life Ireland is funded my Department and will be delivered in partnership with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the tech industry to help attract up to 3,000 top tech professionals to Ireland each year.  Industry is playing an important role in supporting the initiative and driving its development.</font></p><p>It is too early to report on the numbers of returning emigrants to take up employment since the launch of the Programme for a Partnership Government which was launched in May this year, but we will be liaising with the CSO in relation to monitoring this data in due course.</p></reply>

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open up markets for services and offer predictable conditions for investors.</p>  <p>  CETA will save on duty costs as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.</p>  <p>  Given the position taken by Ireland and other Member States, the EU Commission has submitted CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement, that is, one requiring both EU and individual Member States ratification.  Following a decision by the Council with the consent of the European Parliament, it will be possible to provisionally apply CETA.  </p>  <p>  Provisional application is a standard process in Free Trade Agreements which provides for the coming into effect of those areas over which the EU has competence.  Provisional application will not apply to those areas over which Member States have competence including investment protection and investment dispute settlement.  Accordingly, I support provisional application as I am keen to see Irish firms enjoy the tariff free benefits and new business opportunities as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the full entering into force of CETA will be subject, in the first instance, to a decision by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and secondly by the approval of all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.  This means that D&aacute;il Eireann will be part of the final decision to ratify CETA.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the CETA on investment dispute resolution relate solely to the CETA as a multinational trade agreement.  International trade agreements are not part of domestic law. This is why separate adjudication arrangements are required in the event of disputes under the agreement.  </p></reply>

By the end of quarter two in 2016, there were a total of 315 IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to various locations throughout the country.  The following table sets out the number of such visits to each respective county.  The table also shows, on a county-by-county basis, the total number of IDA Ireland client company supported jobs, the number of IDA Ireland client companies and the total number of site visits in 2015.  It is important to note that data on site visits is not an accurate measure of the level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) activity in a region or county.  That is because approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies. </p><p>IDA Ireland Jobs Statistics 2015; Site Visits 2015 and to end Quarter 2 2016 by County<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Total Jobs - 2015</th><th>Number of Companies - 2015</th><th>Site Visits 2015</th><th>Site Visits for Q1 and Q2 - 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>768</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>1,165</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>6,599</td><td>68</td><td>12</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>31,900</td><td>148</td><td>48</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>2,918</td><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>77,244</td><td>652</td><td>242</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>14,297</td><td>60</td><td>41</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1,931</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>10,313</td><td>22</td><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>650</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>97</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>423</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>8,849</td><td>52</td><td>40</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>686</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>3,245</td><td>21</td><td>20</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>3,981</td><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1,571</td><td>17</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>146</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>902</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>936</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>2,029</td><td>22</td><td>15</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3,518</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>5,662</td><td>33</td><td>31</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,529</td><td>16</td><td>28</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2,486</td><td>17</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,211</td><td>18</td><td>7</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>187,056</td><td>1,254</td><td>565</td><td>315</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Additionally, the employer did not properly undertake the Labour Market Needs Test as is required in respect of General Employment Permits <font color="#2F2F2F">i</font>n order to ensure that job opportunities are made available to Irish and EEA nationals. </p><p>The applicant was informed that in accordance with Section 13 of the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended, they<b></b>may seek a review of this refusal decision within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of refusal letter.

Kerry has seen a strong increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) related employment in recent years with a total of 434 additional jobs being created from 2011-2015. IDA Ireland is working hard to identify further investment opportunities for the Southwest region, including Kerry, that will help to generate more opportunities for the people of the wider area. </p>  <p>  In marketing Kerry as part of the Southwest region, IDA Ireland promotes the county&rsquo;s strengths, including its strong entrepreneurial reputation and track record of attracting and retaining multinational companies.  The commuter rail links between Killarney and Tralee and regional airport service with direct international flights are further selling points.  IDA Ireland is also working to grow FDI in the county by developing, in partnership with Kerry County Council, a new marketing campaign called &ldquo;Invest in Kerry&rdquo;, which will be completed by the end of this year.  </p>  <p>  With regard to Castleisland, an official from IDA Ireland met with Castleisland Chamber Alliance in February 2016 to discuss how best to attract FDI to the town.  This meeting focused on how the town can meet the requirements of overseas companies and the steps taken by other locations in Kerry to try and secure further investment.  I am hopeful that more companies will consider situating in Castleisland in the future and I would certainly welcome a visit to the town, and to the wider county, in the time ahead. </p>  <p>  Finally, I want to make clear that increasing the level of FDI outside Ireland&rsquo;s main urban areas remains an absolute priority of mine.  IDA Ireland is equally committed to that goal, as evidenced by the Agency&rsquo;s strategy for the 2015-2019 period which includes the target of growing investment by 30-40% in every region of the country. </p></reply>

There are 12 IDA Ireland client companies employing 1,931 people in the county.  IDA Ireland maintains statistics of site visits by potential investors on a quarterly basis.  By the end of quarter two in 2016, there were two site visits by potential investors to Co. Kerry.  It is important to note that data on site visits is not a true measure of FDI activity in a region or county.  That is because approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its client base, rather than new companies.   </p></reply>

It is also the case that this company announced plans some time ago to further expand its premises in its existing location.  However, its sister company in that same town had been considering a possible relocation in Ireland due to the forthcoming expiry of its lease in its current rented accommodation.  That latter company did inspect a wide range of premises in various locations, with the active engagement and cooperation of IDA Ireland.  Unfortunately, however, the company ultimately decided not to seek an alternative facility and intends to close its operation in its current location.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland will continue its ongoing efforts to secure new investment projects for County Kerry.

Significant progress has been made in the Dublin region. Since the national Action Plan for Jobs was launched in 2012, more than 76,000 additional people are back at work in Dublin.  This compares with job losses of 90,000 in the period 2008 &ndash; 2011.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for the Dublin region was launched last January.  Successful implementation of the Dublin Plan will see the creation of 66,000 extra jobs in the Dublin region by 2020 and an unemployment level of 6 percent.</p>  <p>  Key sectors targeted as part of the plan include areas like technology, financial services, life sciences, manufacturing, tourism and retail as well as &ldquo;smart cities&rdquo; and the creative industries.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Action Plan is being monitored and driven by an Implementation Committees, comprising representatives from the Enterprise Sector, as well as the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, and other public bodies in the region.  Collaboration between the private and the public sector is central to its delivery.  </p>  <p>  I have met the Dublin Committee recently and was greatly encouraged by the progress already made in the implementation of the Plan.  I expect to receive the Committee&rsquo;s first progress report shortly and the report will be published in Q4 of this year.</p>  <p>  Under the Dublin Action Plan, IDA Ireland has committed to delivering 430 additional investments in the years to 2019. IDA Ireland continues to market South County Dublin, including Tallaght and its environs, as a potential location for new foreign direct investment, in order to secure new investment and additional jobs for the region.  South County Dublin is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with good infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grangecastle, and a third level Institute of Technology at Tallaght.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supports job creation in South Dublin, which includes the Tallaght area, through a suite of actions and supports delivered directly and indirectly in collaboration with the many relevant partners in the region.  The main focal point for this support in Tallaght is the Local Enterprise Office (LEO). </p>  <p>  The LEO South Dublin provides a first stop shop in Tallaght for anyone thinking about self-employment and offers business advice clinics such as start your own business, mentoring, funding, etc.  The Tallaght LEO also offers a signposting service for those seeking the support of other agencies such as Intreo, Revenue, County Partnership, County Council, Solas etc.  Finally, the LEO also assists those seeking to access funds from Micro Finance Ireland</p>  <p>  By supporting SMEs, continuing to attract FDI and providing assistance to start-ups to grow and develop, we will see our recovery take hold which will result in improved standards of living for the people of Dublin.  In real terms, what we are aiming for with this project, and what &lsquo;success&rsquo; will look like, is about providing more people, particularly young people, with the opportunity to stay, live, and work in the region.</p></reply>

Globally, supercomputers are playing an ever increasing and critically important role in a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields of relevance to cloud technologies, big data, materials research, healthcare, climate research, weather forecasting, oil and gas exploration amongst others.  Ireland is committed to establishing a world-class research environment characterised by world-class research outputs, populated by researchers of excellence working within a world-class research infrastructure.  Ensuring access to high performance computing (HPC) for computational scientists is integral to the achievement of this overall vision. </p><p>Since 2013 my Department has continued its strong commitment to growing Ireland&rsquo;s capacity in the area of high performance computing (HPC).  Much of my Department&rsquo;s investment in HPC has been channelled through the Irish Centre for High End Computing (ICHEC) which is hosted by NUI Galway.  The investment in this national facility complements local HPC expertise and facilities in Irish universities and research institutes including Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin and the Tyndall National Institute at University College Cork. </p><p>Established in 2005 as the national High-Performance Computing Centre in Ireland, ICHEC operates the national HPC service providing computer resources and software expertise for the research community through collaborative partnerships and programmes of education. </p><p>Following a national review in 2012 of HPC facilities and capacity in Ireland and following consideration of the resulting report, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) and the Department of Education and Skills (DES) agreed that they would jointly provide core funding to ICHEC to enable it to continue to provide this important high performance computing service nationally. </p><p>The joint-funding from both Departments amounted to &euro;1.4m annually over the period 2013 to 2015 - &euro;700,000 coming from each Department. For 2016 both Departments agreed to increase their level of funding to a total allocation of &euro;1.8m. </p><p>A summary of the joint DJEI- DES funding made to ICHEC since 2013 is as follows: <table><tr><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;1.4m</td><td>&euro;1.4m</td><td>&euro;1.4m</td><td>&euro;1.8m</td><td>&euro;6m</td></tr></table>The core funding provided by the two Departments leverages approximately twice this funding in competitive awards from agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, from industry and from EU research programmes.  Over the period 2013 to 2016, ICHEC total budget has been in the region of &euro;11.6m.  This includes over &euro;2m in EU funding alone.</p><p>This commitment of Exchequer funds to ICHEC and high performance computing has been reinforced by the recent decision by my Department and DES to provide funding of &euro;2m per annum to support the delivery of ICHEC&rsquo;s business plan in 2017.  The funding provision to ICHEC is subject to a range of conditions and targets involving the provision of a detailed annual business plan; and ensuring best practice corporate governance arrangements </p><p>In addition to this funding, and under its Research Infrastructure Call, Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) provided funding of &euro;3.7m towards the purchase of a new supercomputer for ICHEC.  This funding was made to ICHEC in 2013.  I understand that ICHEC has submitted an application for additional capital investment in HPC facilities under a recent SFI Research Infrastructure Call and that its application is in the final stages of review. </p><p>Since 2013 my Department, through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and SFI has also made significant investments in research centres and technology centres in the HPC related areas of Big Data Analytics; Future Networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud Computing technologies.  These investments contribute to the achievement of competitive advantage for industry in Ireland by accessing and leveraging the innovative capacity of the Irish research community. </p><p>Small countries such as Ireland cannot afford to compete with larger countries on HPC hardware alone, nor can they justify such investments.  ICHEC has chosen to focus on the effective use of HPC methodologies and novel technologies with application to strategic areas such as energy efficient programming for IoT, remote observation for precision agriculture and planning, high-resolution modelling for renewable energy, and of course big data. </p><p>My Department is presently evaluating continued membership of the European PRACE HPC programme, which would enable Irish Researchers to access the biggest HPC systems in Europe on a competitive basis and access supercomputing and data analysis resources to help drive discoveries and new developments in all areas of science from fundamental research through to applied sciences including mathematics and computer sciences.</p></reply>

Ireland does not encourage the location of brass-plate operations.  The agencies under my remit pursue real substantive foreign direct investment &ndash; the kind that brings real jobs and investment into Ireland.</p></reply>

As section 55(q) of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 gives effect to the provision at point no. 11 of Annex I of Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices, it is the function of the European Court of Justice to ensure that European Union law is interpreted and applied in the same way in all Member States.  To date, the provision in question has not been the subject of a ruling by either the Irish courts or the European Court of Justice.  Though the term &lsquo;media&rsquo; is not defined in the 2005 Directive or the 2007 Act, my Department&rsquo;s view is that section 55(q) of the Act and the provision of the Directive to which it gives effect would cover the activities of social media influencers who are being paid to promote products, service and events through their social media accounts.  This view is based on, among other things, on the very broad definition of &lsquo;commercial practice&rsquo; in the Act and the Directive, the fact that the definition of &lsquo;trader&rsquo; in the Directive includes &lsquo;anyone acting in the name or on behalf of a trader&rsquo;, and the provisions of section 6 of the Interpretation Act 2005 on construing provisions in changing circumstances.  I would emphasise however that this is my Department&rsquo;s view and not an authoritative judicial interpretation.  </p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act and the Directive are also potentially applicable to the activities referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, in particular &ndash;</p>  <p>  - section 55(x) of the Act which prohibits a trader from &lsquo;making a representation or creating an impression that the trader &ndash; </p>  <p>  (i) is not acting for purposes related to the trader&rsquo;s trade, business or profession, when the trader is so acting, or </p>  <p>  (ii) is acting as a consumer when the trader is not;&rsquo;  </p>  <p>  - section 43(3)(e) and (h) of the Act which provide respectively that matters relating to the &lsquo;existence, extent or nature of any approval or sponsorship (direct or indirect) of the product by others&rsquo; and &lsquo;the trader&rsquo;s motives for the commercial practice&rsquo; may be the subject of false, misleading or deceptive information under sections 43(1) or (2) of the Act;</p>  <p>  - section 46(2) of the Act which provides that a commercial practice is misleading under the provisions of section 46 on the omission or concealment of material information if the trader fails to identify the commercial intent of a commercial practice and the practice would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that he or she would not otherwise make. </p>  <p>  The investigation of possible contraventions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 is the function of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission which is fully independent in the exercise of its enforcement functions under this and other enactments.  </p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the provisions of the Code of Standards for Advertising and Marketing Communications of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, in particular the following sections:</p>  <p>  3.31 A marketing communication should be designed and presented in such a way that it is clear that it is a marketing communication.</p>  <p>  3.32 Marketing communications should not misrepresent their true purpose.  Marketing communications should not be presented as, for example, market research, consumer surveys, user-generated content, private blogs, or independent reviews is their purpose is marketing, i.e. the promotion of a product;</p>  <p>  3.33 Advertorials should be clearly identified, should be distinguished from editorial matter and should comply with the Code.      </p></reply>

Its principal function is, once each year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make a recommendation to the Minister in respect of the rate, ensuring that all its decisions are evidence based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.  As you are aware, the current national minimum hourly rate of pay for an adult worker is &euro;9.15.  This rate came into effect on January 1st last following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s first recommendation of July 2015 to increase the rate from &euro;8.65 per hour.  As well as accepting the recommendation, the Government adjusted the PRSI system in Budget 2016 to ensure that the benefit of the increase was not lost to the employee and that the effect of the increase to &euro;9.15 per hour on employer&rsquo;s PRSI liability was mitigated. </p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s second report which my colleague Minister Mitchell-O&rsquo;Connor submitted to Cabinet on July 19th recommends a rate of &euro;9.25 as the national minimum hourly rate.  The recommendation will be considered by the Government in the context of the 2017 budgetary process. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Minimum Wage Acts 2000 and 2015 the Minister is given three months from the date of receipt of a recommendation to declare, by Order a national minimum hourly rate of pay or decline to move such an Order.  Any Order made must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. </p></reply>

However, any scheme funded by Government must have a strong governance regime in place to ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent appropriately.  From the inception of ECCE, services that have chosen to provide it have been required to sign a contract known as the &lsquo;Grant Funding Agreement&rsquo;.</p><p>Each pre-school provider is free to determine their own admission policies, once these are within the terms of the ECCE Programme, as set out in the Grant Funding Agreement.  Contained within this agreement is a stipulation that providers must comply with relevant legislation and regulations, as follows:</p><p>4.1. The Registered Provider agrees to comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, regulations made under the Child Care Act 1991 (as amended, including by the Child and Family Agency Act 2013), planning legislation, fire safety legislation, employment legislation, the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2015, health and safety legislation and the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 in the operation of the Pre-School Service.</p><p>Places provided under the ECCE programme by the Registered Provider must meet the requirements in terms of length per day, days per week and weeks per year (i.e. 3 hours per day, 5 days per week and 38 weeks per year).  As it is not mandatory for children to attend every day, service providers can prioritise places for children where parents indicate a greater level of attendance.</p><p>Where parents have been refused a place or are unable to find one, they should contact their local County Childcare<font color="#FF0000"> </font>Committee<font color="#FF0000"> </font>(CCC) for advice and assistance in locating a suitable place.The CCC can then bring any issues of concern to the attention of my Department.</p></reply>

My Department provided capital funding of &euro;4m to services throughout the country to increase capacity.  I subsequently received approval from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to increase this amount to &euro;6.5m, allowing all applications that met the criteria for grant funding to be approved. </p>  <p>  This capital scheme has already provided several thousand new places, and this number will increase as works are completed.  Capitation rates for ECCE reduced in previous years were restored and I amended the rules that enable access to the higher level of capitation to make it more accessible to services.  In addition, the Department has worked closely with Childcare Committees Ireland to analyse demand for places on a geographic basis, to identify any shortages in provision, and to work intensively with services in areas where shortfalls might have been expected to occur.</p>  <p>  I am happy to report that so far there has been sufficient places to meet demand for places in the September intake, and the indication is that the January intake will also be provided for.  Childcare Committees Ireland has informed me of its confidence that we will have addressed any shortfall that might arise for the April intake in time to ensure that all children will be accommodated. </p>  <p>  The multiple entry points to ECCE was a recommendation in Right from the Start, the Report of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy, published in 2013.  The objective of this recommendation was to ensure that all children could access free pre-school from as early as possible after their third birthday.  My intention is to review the expanded ECCE scheme after the 2016-17 programme year, with a view to making any possible improvements for the next year.</p></reply>

In order to ensure objectivity and fairness it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied in a fair manner.  The rules for all the Department&rsquo;s childcare schemes are clearly published to ensure transparency and consistent application.  An essential component of the scheme&rsquo;s rules is an eligibility date to ensure that the scheme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  From September 2016, the ECCE Programme has been extended to make free pre-school available for 15 hours per week (i.e. 3 hours per day for 5 days), for 38 weeks per annum, to all children from the time they turn three, until they go to primary school (once the child is not older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of the pre-school year i.e. end June).  There will be three opportunities each year - in September, January and April - for eligible children to enrol for the free pre-school provision.  This will ensure that children have the opportunity to enrol as soon as possible after their third birthday. </p>  <p>  The maximum number of free pre-school weeks to which a child is entitled will depend on their date of birth, and the age at which they start primary school.  On average, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the previous provision of 38 weeks.  Access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE can reduce the cost of childcare by &euro;4,000 per child.  The expansion of the ECCE programme will increase the number of children benefitting from 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year. </p>  <p>  The eligibility for ECCE from age three using multiple entry points was a recommendation in Right from the Start, the Report of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy, published in 2013.  The objective of this recommendation was to ensure that all children could access free pre-school from as near as possible after their third birthday until they started primary school.  This would ensure that children and families had access to care and education in these formative years. </p></reply>

These are:</p>  <p>  1. Community Childcare Subvention Programme (CCS)</p>  <p>  2. Childcare Education and Training Support Programme (CETS),</p>  <p>  3. After-School Childcare Programme (ASC)</p>  <p>  4. Community Employment Childcare Programme (CEC).</p>  <p>  These four programmes are administratively very complex and are widely varied in terms of budget, access and eligibility criteria, rates, duration and coverage (in terms of the type and number of childcare services participating in the programmes). </p>  <p>  The Report of the Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) on Future Investment in Childcare considered these targeted childcare programmes as part of their work and made recommendations for reform.  Essentially, it was recommended that all targeted childcare programmes be merged into one single targeted childcare programme with eligibility for a childcare subsidy under the new programme being determined by income only.  The IDG also recommended that State subsidisation of childcare should be paid directly to services as this allows important leverage of quality improvements. Direct payment to services has also been found internationally to be the best way to control costs.</p>  <p>  Under Budget 2016 funding to convene a Design Team to develop the single affordable childcare programme was allocated.  Work on the new single scheme is advancing.  The intention of the new Scheme is to replace the existing targeted schemes with a new streamlined subsidy scheme which is more accessible for parents and providers, which enhances affordability and which provides a flexible platform for future investment in childcare in Ireland.  In line with these objectives, the proposed scheme is designed flexibly so that it can be developed and expanded over time.  </p>  <p>  I brought the proposals for the new Scheme to the Cabinet Sub-committee on September 15th and intend to submit the proposals formally to Government in the near future.  I also intend to commission a study on the cost of childcare provision in Ireland before the end of 2016 to inform further policy development.</p>  <p>  In developing policy proposals, careful consideration has been given to the issues raised by the Deputy in terms of ensuring that new arrangements will directly benefit families, further details on this will be made available following Government consideration of the proposals.</p></reply>

An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  Of the 25,069 open cases, 80% (20,019) had an allocated social worker and 5,050 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  This is a decrease of 1,668 (25%) in the number of unallocated cases since December 2015.  The table gives details of the numbers of open cases broken into allocated and awaiting allocation for each administrative area as at end July 2016. </p><p>Tusla is implementing a national caseload management system which allows management to monitor caseloads in terms of both number and complexity.  It is recognised that, from time to time, individual cases can occupy a disproportionate amount of resources.  The caseload management system gives managers a clearer insight into the pressures on staff.  My Department continues to monitor the number of cases that are reported as awaiting the allocation of a social worker.  The additional staff being recruited and the caseload management system will make an improvement in these figures.<table><tr><th>Administrative Area - July 2016</th><th>Number of Open Cases </th><th>Number of Open Cases Allocated </th><th>% of Open Cases Allocated </th><th>Number of Open Cases Awaiting Allocation </th><th>% of Open Cases Awaiting Allocation </th></tr><tr><td>Dublin South Central</td><td>1,222</td><td>1,116</td><td>91%</td><td>106</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East/Wicklow</td><td>1,045</td><td>981</td><td>94%</td><td>64</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South West /Kildare/West Wicklow</td><td>1,122</td><td>517</td><td>46%</td><td>605</td><td>54%</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>1,638</td><td>1,041</td><td>64%</td><td>597</td><td>36%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North City </td><td>1,781</td><td>1,533</td><td>86%</td><td>248</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North</td><td>2,716</td><td>2,007</td><td>74%</td><td>709</td><td>26%</td></tr><tr><td>Louth/Meath</td><td>1,407</td><td>1,144</td><td>81%</td><td>263</td><td>19%</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>699</td><td>475</td><td>68%</td><td>224</td><td>32%</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>4,794</td><td>4,031</td><td>84%</td><td>763</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>561</td><td>531</td><td>95%</td><td>30</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow/Kilkenny/South Tipperary</td><td>1,139</td><td>839</td><td>74%</td><td>300</td><td>26%</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford/Wexford</td><td>1,655</td><td>1,376</td><td>83%</td><td>279</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>Mid West</td><td>1,723</td><td>1,411</td><td>82%</td><td>312</td><td>18%</td></tr><tr><td>Galway/Roscommon</td><td>1,779</td><td>1,398</td><td>79%</td><td>381</td><td>21%</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>584</td><td>564</td><td>97%</td><td>20</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>748</td><td>700</td><td>94%</td><td>48</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan</td><td>456</td><td>355</td><td>78%</td><td>101</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>National Total</td><td>25,069</td><td>20,019</td><td>80%</td><td>5,050</td><td>20%</td></tr></table></p><p>Tusla is currently reviewing the management of unallocated cases in all areas to ensure that thresholds are being applied consistently and appropriate actions taken as required.

The scale of this impact is very hard to predict. The fact that the take-up of the ECCE scheme is 95% indicates that a very large proportion of families who do not currently use non-parental childcare might take up the offer of free childcare. In addition, the hours of childcare used each week by every family might increase significantly, if childcare were free to parents.</p>  <p>  If these effects on the demand for childcare are ignored, we can estimate the cost of providing childcare only to families who are already using centre-based childcare. Given current numbers and current patterns of childcare usage, if all childcare were free to parents, and if the State paid childcare providers the equivalent of the current market fees for childcare, the total cost to the State is estimated as &euro;498 million per annum. If the free childcare were available not only to those currently using centre-based care, but also to those currently using paid childminders, the total cost would rise to an estimated &euro;888 million per annum. The impact of such a measure on the demand for childcare would lead to an annual cost that could be a multiple of these figures.</p>  <p>  The costs of the measures described are heavily dependent on uptake &ndash; it is estimated that, at present, 10% of children under three are in formal childcare. To cater for up to 100% of children between 6 months and 5 years of age would require significant capital investment to increase the capacity of the childcare sector.   </p>  <p>  The cost of childcare for children under one year old is considerably higher than for children participating in ECCE, as a significantly higher ratio of staff to children is required (11:1 for ECCE-age children, 3:1 for children below one year of age).</p>  <p>  Given the complexities described above it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of cost. The Department is currently in the process of procuring an independent review of the cost of care, following which the data required to enable an answer to this question will be available.</p></reply>

To cater for an expansion of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme would require significant capital investment to increase the capacity of the childcare sector. In addition, this is likely to require an enormous volume of additional qualified staff. </p>  <p>  Currently the ECCE Programme is available for children from the age of three until they attend primary school, provided they are no older than five years and six months by the end of the pre-school year, (ie. end of June). As all children must be in primary school by the age of six it would be impractical to extend the ECCE Programme beyond the current cut off point of five years and six months. Therefore, if ECCE were to be provided for a third year the programme would need to be extended to children from the age of two. The cost of childcare for children aged between one year of age, and two years of age is considerably higher than for children participating in ECCE, as a significantly higher ratio of staff to children is required (11:1 for current ECCE-age children, 5:1 for children between the ages of one and two-and-a-half).</p>  <p>  Given the complexities described above it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of cost. The Department is currently in the process of procuring an independent review of the cost of care, following which the data required to enable an answer to this question may be available.</p></reply>

The person is invited to put forward a case setting out their circumstances; details of the compensation actually received, and whether there are any special or extenuating circumstances involved. Consideration is given to the case made before a final decision is made under Section 13(2) of the Act. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that where a member of the Permanent Defence Force leaves on ill health grounds there may also be an entitlement under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes to an occupational pension, in addition to a disability pension or gratuity under the Army Pensions Acts. </p></reply>

Full details have yet to emerge in relation to this proposal but it is understood that it may include the establishment of a European Defence Research Programme (ERDP) post the completion of the Horizon 2020 research programme.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-27a.2752.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092700112#WRFF04500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 975, 977 and 980 to 985, inclusive, together.   </p>  <p>  The health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a priority for both myself and the Defence Forces. The choice of medication for overseas deployment is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. Cost of medication and or the rank of an individual are not considerations in prescribing anti-malarial medication. </p>  <p>  Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications. It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability. </p>  <p>  Malaria is a serious disease which killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015, with 90% of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa as reported by the World Health Organisation. I am advised by the military authorities that they are not aware of any serving member of the Defence Forces dying from malaria in the past ten years. </p>  <p>I am advised that information in relation to side effects or illnesses contracted by Defence Forces Personnel including instances of malaria is maintained on each individual&rsquo;s medical file.   There is no way of providing the exact information sought by the Deputy without examining every medical record of each member who served overseas . With in   the existing resources available, this is not feasible. </p>  <p>  With regard to Afghanistan, Lariam was not the recommended first line chemoprophylactic agent for Irish Defence Force personnel when they were serving there. The Deputy may wish to note that Defence Forces personnel are no longer serving in Afghanistan. As I have indicated, the choice of medication for overseas deployment, is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Irish Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  Deployments to Sub-Saharan Africa require the use of an anti-malaria regime. The Defence Forces, Director of the Medical Branch&rsquo;s current advice, guidance and policy in relation to malaria chemoprophylaxis is that in the case of sub-Saharan Africa, Lariam is the agent of first choice. In special circumstances the other agents may be used. For example, if for operational reasons it was imperative that an individual deploy immediately without the normal &lsquo;lead-in&rsquo; time which is required for Lariam, then one of the other alternative medications should be used. Equally, if an individual who had a specific skill set which was fundamental to mission success and either had previously demonstrated sensitivity to Lariam, or had a contraindication to its use in the first place, then that individual would receive derogation from the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; policy and be placed on another medication. If during the course of deployment, an individual developed sensitivity to Lariam, he/she would desist from Lariam and be placed on an alternative. In all the examples above, the basic principle remain the same &ndash; it revolves around the balance struck between the requirements of the particular mission and patient safety. </p>  <p>  As a result of its extended half-life in the blood, Lariam is taken on a weekly basis rather than on a daily basis. This has two direct and significant consequences. Firstly, a weekly medication facilitates compliance. Secondly, even if a dose is missed by 24 hours, there is still a residual quantity of the active ingredient in the blood which gives a certain degree of protection. If, however, one of the daily medications is missed by 24 hours, the patient is immediately susceptible to malaria. Prevention of disease for military personnel serving overseas is of the utmost importance. In addition, a peace keeping or peace enforcing military force has to prepare for all eventualities. The military activity of a force is dictated, not so much by a clock or calendar, but by the operational tempo at any given time. Such a reality creates difficulty in abiding by a daily dosing regimen. This is a fact of life which differentiates the civilian office worker or tourist from the deployed soldier. Thus the weekly medication provides some mitigation against the unforeseen and unpredictable aspect of overseas service. This is one of the reasons why Lariam remains the medication of choice in malaria chemoprophylaxis for Defence Forces personnel deployed to Sub Saharan Africa. </p>  <p>While there are other agents available, their use is associated with an increased risk of contracting malaria as indicated above. Therefore, subject to the special circumstances listed above, an individual who can take Lariam is selected in preference to one who cannot take Lariam because of the lesser risk to the individual and, by extension, to the mission. There are, however, circumstances when the demands of the mission justify this increased risk.   </p>  <p>  As I have already indicated, significant precautions are taken by Irish Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications. It is the policy of the Irish Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability. </p>  <p>The Deputy will be aware that a Working Group is currently reviewing developments arising in relation to the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis. This work has included further engagement with international experts and I anticipate that it will finalise its second Report shortly.   </p>  <p>There are no plans at this time to withdraw Lariam from the range of anti-malarial medications available to the Defence Forces.  The use of and the information on medications is kept under ongoing review. Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam, remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.   </p></reply>

The future equipment priorities for the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the recently published White Paper.</p><p>The current Naval Service ship replacement programme has seen the delivery of three new Naval Service vessels in the past three years. In June 2016, agreement was reached with Babcock International for the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service to be built in their facility in Appledore, Devon.  This ship will be the same class as the three newest vessels, <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>which was commissioned in 2014, <i>LE James Joyce</i>which was commissioned in 2015, and <i>LE </i><i>William Butler Yeats </i>which will be formally named and commissioned into operational service at a ceremony in Galway next month.  Delivery of the fourth ship is expected within two years, which ties in with the project planning process in place under the White Paper on Defence which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. </p><p>The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the current flagship, <i>LE </i><i>Eithne</i>, by a multi-role vessel (MRV).  <i>LE </i><i>Eithne</i>was built in 1984. In addition, the two existing Coastal Patrol Vessels, <i>LE Ciara</i>and <i>LE </i><i>Orla </i>are due for replacement in the coming years (also built in 1984). It is outlined in the White Paper that these ships will be replaced with vessels with countermine and counter IED capabilities. </p><p>In addition, the White Paper recognises the requirement to maintain and upgrade vessels having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will ensure that the Naval Service are fully equipped to meet the roles placed on them.</p></reply>

Ireland takes over command of the Battalion from Finland in November 2016 at which time an additional Company of some 150 personnel will be deployed to UNIFIL bringing Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this mission to 370 personnel. </p><p>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas. With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Defence includes a commitment to review Ireland's declared contribution to United Nations Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System ( PCRS ) (formerly UNSAS) and the EU Headline Goal; to include consideration of the potential deployability of the full range of Defence Forces' capabilities including Army, Air Corps and Naval Service capabilities and assets on peace support and crisis management operations. This review will commence in 2017.</p><p>The current contribution of some 498 Defence Forces personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p><p>Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are as follows:</p><p><i>Members of the Permanent Defence Force Serving Overseas</i></p><p><i>As of 01 September 2016</i></p><p>1. <i>UN MISSIONS</i></p><p>(i) UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ - 30</p><p>UNIFIL 53<sup>rd</sup>Infantry Group -185</p><p>UNIFIL Sector West HQ  -  4</p><p>(ii) UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) Israel &amp;amp; Syria - 11</p><p>(iii) MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)  - 3</p><p>(iv)MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo)- 4</p><p>(v) UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast)  - 1</p><p>(vi) UNDOF (United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) HQ, Golan Heights, Syria- 7</p><p>UNDOF 52<sup>nd</sup>Infantry Group-129</p><p>TOTAL  368</p><p><i>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</i></p><p>(vii) EUFOR (EU-led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)  -  7</p><p>(viii) EUTM Mali (EU-Led Training Mission)  - 15</p><p>(ix) KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo ) HQ - 12</p><p>2. <i>OTHER DEPLOYMENTS</i></p><p>Naval Service Humanitarian Mission in Mediterranean L.&Eacute;.

The Defence Forces have no restrictions with regard to the assignment of men or women to the full range of operat ional and administrative duties , and all promotions and career courses are open to both sexes on merit. </p><p>A key impediment in achieving greater numbers of women serving in the Defence Forces is the lack of women recruitment applicants relative to men. This may be as a result of societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers. There have been a number of recent initiatives to encourage greater female participation, such as:</p><p>- The introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,</p><p>- Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,</p><p>- A balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,</p><p>- All promotions and career courses are open to both sexes on merit,</p><p>- A Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces and,</p><p>- Work is well-progressed on a Defence Forces Equality and Diversity Policy, which will be published in the near future. </p><p>Over the course of the White Paper 2015, further initiatives will be developed to encourage more women to apply for the Defence Forces and to increase female participation at all ranks. This will include a survey to identify any impediments to the advancement of women in the PDF, as well as the impact of the requirements of career courses and overseas service on f emale retention and advancement.  The development and active management of a Diversity and an Inclusion Strategy in the Defence Forces, building on existing policies in rel ation to ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and equality will also be included.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, at 31 July 2016, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,025, comprising 7,233 Army, 718 Air Corps and 1,074 Naval Service, whole time equivalent personnel.  The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>In line with HR policy there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force due to the requirement to maintain a lower age profile. T  argeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels. </p><p>The current General Service recruitment campaign, which was launched on 13 April 2016, envisages an intake of approximately 600 General Services Recruits in 2016. The Military Authorities have advised that 282 General Service Recruits have been enlisted to date in 2016, with a further 320 recruits to be enlisted by year end. Plans have been put in place to continue this phased General Service recruitment in 2017, in a manner designed to reach the established strength figure.</p><p>In relation to the officer cadre, a total of 97 Cadetships were awarded following the 2016 competition, comprising of 68 Army, 2 Equitation School, 12 Air Corps and 15 Naval Service Cadetships. These Cadets commenced training this month in the Defence Forces Cadet School. This is the highest Cadet intake in the history of the State. </p><p>Direct Entry Competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled. An Air Corps Apprentice Aircraft Technician competition was launched on 9 August 2016, from which it is planned to enlist 25 Apprentice Aircraft Technicians . A Direct Entry competition is also ongoing to induct suitably qualified applicants as Officers in the Operations Branch, Marine Engineer Branch and Electrical Engineer Branch of the Naval Service.</p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>
